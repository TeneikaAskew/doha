On November 26, 2008, the \ntranscript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence, but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit 1. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since \nJanuary 2006, and is seeking to obtain a top secret security clearance. She is part of a \nmanufacturing excellence team3 following a rotational engineering leadership \ndevelopment program. (Tr. 37, 38) Co-workers, colleagues, and friends state Applicant \nis talented, dedicated, dependable, conscientious employee with an impeccable work \nethic. (Ex B) She is organized, efficient, extremely competent, has strong leadership \nskills, and has excellent rapport with people. She goes beyond all requirements to \nachieve all her goals and those of the team.  \n \nApplicant is civic minded and engaged in her community. Applicant has a \npassion for volunteer work. (Tr. 57) She volunteers her time and talents to help and aid \nothers. She provided valuable service to the Red Cross during fires in her state. (Ex C, \nTr. 58) She does volunteer work with the United Service Organizations (USO) \nwelcoming the soldiers home and seeing them off. (Tr. 58) She has also done volunteer \nwork with Habitat for Humanity, CoCo Best, Mathcount, and RoboRock, motivating \n \n2 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n3 The company selects 17 individuals from the 73,000 employees of the company.

She also volunteered with Cradle to Crayons and organization that \nprovides clothing and necessities to children. (Ex A, Tr. 59) She also spends time \nvisiting the VA hospital. (Tr. 59)  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iran. Applicant has 31 relatives living in the U.S. Twenty-\nfour years ago, when Applicant was five years old, her uncle who has lived in the U.S \nsince 1978, sponsored her family for immigration to the U.S. (Tr. 23) The process was \nnot completed until Applicant was 18 years old and her brother was 23 years old. \nBecause her brother, at that time, was then a single child over 21 years old, his status \nhad changed. In October 1997, when Applicant and her parents came to the U.S., her \nbrother was not able to accompany them. When they arrived in the U.S., Applicant\u2019s \nmother applied to allow him to come to the U.S.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother lives in an apartment in Iran owned by her parents. (Tr. 40) \nSince 1998, her brother has been in the process of obtaining his green card. (Gov Ex 1) \nHe is a doctor, a general practitioner, who has taken and passed the United States \nMedical Licensing Examination (MLE) with a score of 99. (Ex F, Tr. 25) In December \n2008, her brother was informed the immigration administrative process was complete \nand he needed to visit the Immigrant Visa Unit to finalize the process. (Ex G) Her \nbrother\u2019s interview was set for January 29, 2009. Applicant contacts her brother twice a \nyear; at New Years and on her brother\u2019s birthday. Applicant has talked to her sister-in-\nlaw once, but has never met her. (Gov Ex 2) Applicant is unsure if her sister-in-law is \nemployed, but Applicant knows her sister-in-law has a master\u2019s degree in architecture. \n(Tr. 41) Applicant has cousins who are citizens and residents of Iran who she talks to \nonce a year at New Year\u2019s time. (Tr. 24) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother has four sisters and four brothers, all but one of which live in \nthe U.S. (Tr. 25) One sister is retired and lives in Iran with her two children. One of \nApplicant\u2019s other aunts has applied for that sister to immigrate to the U.S. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant does not talk to this aunt. (Tr. 42) Both her cousins have applications to \nimmigrate to the U.S. (Tr. 43)  \n \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s family migrated to the U.S. in the late 1970\u2019s, before the \nrevolution. (Tr. 28) They have been living in the U.S., some since birth and others \nbetween 8 and 34 years. (Ex F) Applicant\u2019s uncle, a cardiologist (Tr. 47), has lived in the \nU.S. for 31 years, her aunt, an accountant, 18 years. Their three children are students \nliving in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s uncle, who is an electrical engineer, has lived in the U.S. \neight years. An aunt, who is a medical director and practicing internist, has lived in the \nU.S. for 25 years. (Tr. 47) An uncle, a college department chair, was born and raised in \nthe U.S. Another uncle, a university professor, has lived here 34 years. She has four \ncousins who were born and raised in the U.S.  \n \n \nApplicant has an aunt, a retired dentist, who has lived here 10 years as has her \naunt\u2019s son. An uncle, who is a retired agricultural engineer, has lived in the U.S. for 10 \nyears. She has an uncle, who is a retired editor and writer, who was born and raised in \n\n \n \n \n4\n                                                          \nthe U.S. who is married to Applicant\u2019s aunt, a science teacher, who has lived in the U.S. \nfor 32 years. Their daughter, a student, has lived here 11 years. Applicant has an uncle, \nwho works for a pizza restaurant, who has been in the U.S. 31 years. She has an aunt, \na nurse, who has been here 13 years. Her uncle, an anesthesiologist, has been in the \nU.S. 10 years as has his wife, a retired teacher. (Tr. 47) An uncle, a store manger and \nhis wife, a cosmetologist, and their child, a student, have lived in the U.S. for eight \nyears. A cousin, an internal medicine doctor, his wife, also an M.D., and their two \ndaughters, both students, have lived in the U.S. for 12 year. (Ex F)  \n \n \nIn March 2003, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Ex A, Tr. 16) Her \nparents have lived in the U.S. for 11 years and are naturalized U.S. citizens. Her father \nis a retired accountant, who had worked for a private company, and her mother is a \nretired economist. (Tr. 28) In April 2005, Applicant\u2019s father became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. (Gov Ex 1) In December 2006, Applicant\u2019s mother became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. (Gov Ex 2) Her parents periodically return to Iran to visit their son and usually \nstay for a month or two In Iran. (Tr. 39, 40)  \n \nIn August 2002, Applicant received a bachelor of science degree in electrical \nengineer from an American institute of technology. While attending school she was \nawarded an academic excellence award and was recognized for the highest academic \nachievement in mathematics and calculus. She was a member of Phi Theta Kappa \nsociety4 and on the college Dean\u2019s list numerous times. She is certified to be a \ncommunity college teacher. While working on her master\u2019s degree, she taught college \nmathematics. (Tr. 30) In 2006, Applicant received a Master of Science degree in \nelectrical engineering from an American university. (Ex D) That same year she \nrelocated to a new state to begin working at her current job. (Tr. 35) \n \n \nIn 2000, Applicant married a U.S. citizen whose parents were born in Iran. Her in-\nlaws were naturalized U.S. citizens. In December 2005, Applicant and her spouse filed \nfor separation and the divorce was final in June 2006. (Gov Ex 2) Since the divorce, she \nhas not had any contact with her ex-spouse or his parents.  \n \n \nIn July 2002, Applicant received an Iranian passport, which expired in July 2007. \nApplicant surrendered the passport to her company\u2019s security officers and it was \ndestroyed. (Tr. 53) Applicant traveled to Iran in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2005 when \nApplicant was between the ages of 20 and 26. In 2005, during her last trip to Iran, she \nrealized so many things had changed. She realized she had grown apart from her \ncousins and her brother, who she talks with once or twice a year. (Tr. 27) In 2005, \nApplicant realized she did not want to return to Iran even though her passport did not \nexpire until 2007. (Tr. 27) She was simply fed up with the conditions and regulations in \nIran. Applicant has lived her adulthood in the U.S. and her way of thinking vastly differs \nfrom the way those in Iran think. (Tr. 56) She finds it hard to relate to her cousins in Iran.  \n \n4 Phi Theta Kappa is the equivalent for two-year universities what Phi Beta Kappa is for four-year \nuniversities. \n\n \n \n \n5\n                                                          \n \nApplicant owns no property or funds in Iran or any other foreign location. (Tr. 41) \nApplicant has approximately $30,000 in her company retirement program. (Tr. 45) She \nowns a home in the U.S. worth approximately $175,000. (Ex E, Tr. 44) She has known \nsince age 5 that she wanted to come to the U.S. to live. (Tr. 28) Applicant chose the \nU.S. to be her home and her total allegiance and loyalty is to the U.S. (Tr. 67) She is a \nproud and committed citizen of the U.S. supporting the nation, its government, \ninstitutions, and military. She believes in the U.S. constitution, the nation\u2019s laws, and the \nfounding father\u2019s beliefs.  \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d  \n \nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n$ \nIran=s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction; \n$ \nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n$ \nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process;  \n$ \nIts dismal human rights record; and \n$ \nIran=s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.5 \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor \nof terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. The government \nof Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against the Iranian \npeople. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary executions, \nincluding of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; severe \nrestrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement and \nprivacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and legal \nand societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nTravel to Iran remains problematic. The State Department continues to warn U.S. \ncitizens to consider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in \nIran and the children of Iranian citizens\u2014even those without Iranian passports who do \nnot consider themselves Iranian\u2014are considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, \nsince Iran does not recognize dual citizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these \n \n5U.S. Department of State; Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 3 \u2013 State Sponsors of \nTerrorism Overview, dated April 30, 2008, U.S. Department of State, State Sponsors of Terrorism. \n\n \n \n \n6\nindividuals hold U.S. citizenship, under Iranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an \nIranian passport, unless the Iranian government has recognized a formal renunciation \nor loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-Iranian dual nationals have been denied permission \nto enter/depart Iran using their U.S. passport; they even had their U.S. passports \nconfiscated upon arrival or departure. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and \nharassed by the Iranian government. Iranian security personnel may place foreign \nvisitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones and fax machines may be \nmonitored, and personnel possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. \n \n \nSome elements of the Iranian government and population remain hostile to the \nU.S. Consequently, American citizens may be subject to harassment or arrest while \ntraveling or residing in Iran. The U.S. government does not currently have diplomatic or \nconsular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and therefore, cannot provide \nprotection or routine consular services to American citizens in Iran. The Swiss \ngovernment, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as protecting power for U.S. \ninterests in Iran. Neither U.S. passports nor visas to the United States are issued in \nTehran.  \n \n \nThe Iranian government does not recognize dual citizenship and generally does \nnot permit the Swiss to provide protective services for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian \nnationals. In addition, U.S. citizens of Iranian origin who are considered by Iran to be \nIranian citizens have been detained and harassed by Iranian authorities.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n \n \n7\n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nIn every case where a relative lives overseas, there is a risk of pressure on this \nrelative and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. Under the facts of \nthis case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, manipulation pressure, or \ncoercion is substantiated. However, Applicant has significant ties to the U.S. and few \nties to Iran. While she still has a brother, aunt, and cousins living in Iran, and her \nparents periodically visit their son in Iran, she has 31 relatives living in the U.S. She has \n\n \n \n \n8\nno financial or property interests in Iran. She owns a home in the U.S. and her ties with \nthe U.S. are much stronger than her ties with Iran. \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s brother, aunt, and two cousins are citizens and residents of \nIran. She visited Iran five times between 1999 and 2005 using an Iranian passport for \nthese visits. Having considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, \napplicable conditions that could possibly raise a security concern are AG & 7(a) \u201ccontact \nwith a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other \nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d \nand AG & 7(b) \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG && 7(a) and 7(b) apply. \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority;  \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \n\n \n \n \n9\n                                                          \nIn 1997, Applicant left Iran with her parents at age 18. They were in the \nimmigration process for 13 years. In 2003, she became a U.S. citizen. Her work \nperformance has been outstanding. Since leaving Iran, Applicant visited Iran five times. \nDuring her last visit in 2005, she realized how much she had changed and how she \ndiffered from her cousins living in Iran. She has no desire to ever return to Iran. She has \ncontact with her two cousins once a year during the Iranian New Years. Applicant \nsurrendered her expired Iranian passport to her company\u2019s security officers and it was \ndestroyed. She talks with her brother twice a year. She has only talked to her sister-in-\nlaw once. Applicant has no contact with her aunt living in Iran. Another of Applicant\u2019s \naunts has started the process of sponsoring the aunt and cousins who reside in Iran, \nwhich as previously noted is a lengthy process to immigrate to the U.S.  \n \nAG && 8(a) and 8(c)6 partially apply. Because of her limited contact with her \nbrother and cousins, \u201cit is unlikely [she] will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interest of [her family living in Iran] and the interest of the U.S. \u201cHer \ninfrequent contact (twice a year) with her brother, (once a year) with her cousins, only \none time with her sister-in-law and not particularly close relationship with them results in \na very low potential for forcing her to choose between the United States and Iran. She \nmet her burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [her relationship with her Iranian \nsiblings] could create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d However AG && 8(a) \nand 8(b) cannot be fully applied because of Iran\u2019s hostile relationship with the U.S and \nIran\u2019s negative human rights record makes it more likely that Iran would violate the law \nto gain classified information.  \n \n6 In ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 3, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id. In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), \nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)) and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \n\u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many \nof these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person concept.  \n \n\n \n \n \n10\n \nOf concern are Applicant\u2019s parent\u2019s trips to Iran to visit their son. Of course, \nApplicant has no control over her parent\u2019s travel, but they do visit Iran. It is likely their \nvisits will terminate in the near future. The sole reason for traveling to Iran is to visit their \nson. In 1978, when Applicant\u2019s uncle started the process of sponsoring Applicant\u2019s \nfamily, it was hoped that Applicant, her parents, and her brother would all immigrate to \nthe U.S. together. However, when the process was completed her brother\u2014then age 23 \nand single\u2014was not able to accompany them. In the near future, they will all be \ntogether in the U.S.  \n \n \nSince 1998, her brother has been in the process of obtaining his green card. He \nis a doctor, a general practitioner, who has taken and passed the United States Medical \nLicensing Examination. In December 2008, he was informed the administrative process \nwas complete and he needed to visit the Immigrant Visa Unit to complete the process. \nHaving waited 20 years to be allowed to immigrate and rejoin his family, with his parents \nand sister being naturalized U.S. citizens, and having 31 additional relatives living in the \nU.S., it is likely he will move to the U.S. shortly.  \n \nWhile danger certainly exists for all who go to Iran, Applicant\u2019s parents, brother, \nand cousins are in no greater danger than any other individual living and working in \nIran. Applicant is in less danger since she no longer travels to Iran and intends not to \nreturn.  \n \nThere is no evidence that terrorists or the Iranian Government have approached \nor threatened her parents, brother, aunt, or cousins for any reason. There is no \nevidence that her retired parents or her brother, a general practitioner doctor living in \nIran, or her other Iranian relatives currently engage in activities which would bring \nattention to them or that they or other Iranian elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s \nwork. As such, there is a reduced possibility that her relatives or Applicant would be \ntargets for coercion or exploitation. None of her Iranian relatives are involved with \norganizations which seek to harm the U.S. \n \nAG & 8(b) fully applies. There is no evidence that her parents, her brother, her \nsister-in-law, or cousins have been political activists, challenging the policies of the \nIranian Government. There is no evidence any of them currently works or ever worked \nfor the Iranian Government, military, or new media, or that of any other foreign \ngovernment. Applicant\u2019s parents are retired and her brother is a doctor.  \n \nApplicant was born in Iran and came to the United States following high school to \nattend college. She obtained a BS and MS degrees from U.S. universities. Applicant\u2019s \nviews are in opposition of the current Iranian regime. Her trips to Iran, especially her \nfinal trip in 2005, reinforced her appreciation for the freedom she has in the U.S. \nApplicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [she] \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \n \n\n \n \n \n11\nAG & 8(f) partially applies because she has no interest in foreign property and \nshe has significant U.S. property and assets. However, AG & 8(f) does not apply \nbecause the SOR and record do not raise AG & 7(e).  \n \nThere is little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Likewise, because of her \nclose ties and her loyalties to the U.S., she would resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. These mitigating conditions taken together are sufficient to fully overcome \nthe foreign influence security concerns. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran and the heavy burden \nan Applicant carries when she has family members in a foreign country, such as Iran.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nApplicant has lived in the U.S. for 11 years. She came to the U.S. following high \nschool. Applicant chose the U.S. to be her home and her total allegiance and loyalty is \nto the U.S. She is a proud and committed U.S. citizen, of the supporting the nation, its \ngovernment, institutions, and military. She believes in the U.S. constitution, the nation\u2019s \nlaws, and the founding father\u2019s beliefs. She is active in her community and volunteers \nfor an extraordinary number of charities. Her love of the U.S. was made especially clear \n\n \n \n \n12\nduring her last trip to Iran in 2005, when she realized how different she was from her \ncousins.  \n \nApplicant does not intent to return to Iran. Her property and future are in the U.S. \nShortly, her family will be here also. Although she visited Iran five times between 1999 \nand 2005; she has no intention of visiting Iran in the future and her Iranian passport has \nbeen destroyed. I have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I have \nconsidered the Iranian government\u2019s hostile relationship with the U.S. and its \nunwillingness to comply with international law and respect the human rights of Iranians \nand former Iranians. I find that there is little potential for Applicant to be pressured, \ncoerced, or exploited because she has family members living in Iran. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \nOn March 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 7, 2008, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) on May 1, 2008. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on \n \n1 \n \n \nJuly 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nMay 7, 2008, and it was received on May 19, 200. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit additional information. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 7, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. They are incorporated \nherein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and served as a police officer for 20 years attaining the \nrank of Detective. He retired in 1993 and has held various jobs since then. He \nexperienced periods of unemployment from May 1999 to September 1999 and May \n2006 to December 2006. He has been employed as a contract investigator with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor since December 2006. Applicant was married from \n1970 to 2003. He has three adult children.  \n \n \nApplicant has a judgment against him in favor of his ex-wife in the approximate \namount of $23,348. He admitted he owes this debt and it has been delinquent since \n2004. It is a debt for alimony pursuant to a divorce decree. Applicant\u2019s response \nregarding the debt is as follows:  \n \nThe monies in question were the result of a default judgment found \nagainst me while I lived in [Place A]. She was and has been receiving 47 \npercent of my law enforcement pension and I was to receive 47 percent of \nher teaching pension when she retired which to date has not happened. I \nhad been under the assumption that any monies owed would be resolved \nat that time. These money equations were to be worked out by our \ncorresponding attorneys.1 \n \nNo explanation was provided for why Applicant has not resolved this debt when \nhe is aware he owes it.  \n \n \nApplicant admits the debt owed in SOR \u00b6 1.b and claimed it was in the process \nof being paid off by monthly payments when they were halted due to the default \njudgment that froze his funds and payments. Applicant offered no other explanation for \nwhy he has not resolved this debt. No documentation was provided to support his \nassertion. \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is for telephone services. Applicant claimed this debt was \nthe result of an ongoing dispute he had with the telephone company because of \n\u201cimproper services I received from them, improper equipment I received and a lack of \n \n1 Item 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nconcern on their part over the quality of service I was receiving from them.\u201d2 Applicant \noffered no explanation for why he has not resolved this debt or any action he has taken \nto formally dispute the debt.  \n \n \nApplicant stated he had no knowledge about the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He \nclaimed his account records indicate his prompt payment to this creditor until he moved \nand closed the account. He failed to provide any documentation to support his assertion \nor any action he has taken to resolve or dispute the debt.  \n \n \nApplicant did not offer any documents to support any of his assertions nor any \ncorroborating evidence.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \n2 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them, especially AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant has a default \njudgment against him that despite being aware of it and its effect on his other debts he \nhas not resolved. The default judgment is four years old. He also has other debts that \nhe apparently disputes, but has done nothing to resolve them. I find both disqualifying \nconditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions. I especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \n\n \n5 \n \n \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d); and (e) (\u201cthe individual has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d). \n  \n \nApplicant is aware that he has a legally binding default judgment entered against \nhim for approximately $23,348. He is aware of his responsibility toward paying this \njudgment. He apparently believes that somehow this dispute will be resolved at a later \ndate by the attorneys who were involved in his divorce proceedings. He has offered no \nevidence to show he has made an attempt to discuss the issue with his attorney, pay \nthe judgment or resolve it. He claimed that because of the judgment somehow his \npayments on another debt were frozen. Again he offered nothing to show he was paying \nthis debt and why he is not paying this delinquent debt. He admitted the debts in his \nAnswer to the SOR, but does not offer any evidence to show he is resolving them. He \nhas not provided any documents to support he paid his debts or is formally disputing \nthem. He merely discounts his obligations toward his creditors. Applicant is unwilling to \nresolve his delinquent debts. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant acknowledged and \nadmitted his delinquent debts, but offered no evidence of efforts he has made to resolve \nor pay the debts. Overall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. They are incorporated herein. In addition, I have thoroughly and carefully reviewed all of the pleadings and exhibits submitted. I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 59 years old and served as a police officer for 20 years attaining the rank of Detective. He retired in 1993 and has held various jobs since then. He experienced periods of unemployment from May 1999 to September 1999 and May 2006 to December 2006. He has been employed as a contract investigator with a Department of Defense contractor since December 2006. Applicant was married from 1970 to 2003. He has three adult children. A judgment was entered against Applicant in favor of his ex-wife as alleged in SOR \u00b61.a in the approximate amount of $23,348. The judgment has been owed since August 2004. It is a debt for a portion of Applicant\u2019s pension to be paid to his ex-wife pursuant to a divorce decree. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR regarding the debt is as follows: The monies in question were the result of a default judgment found against me while I lived in [Place A]. She was and has been receiving 47 percent of my law enforcement pension and I was to receive 47 percent of her teaching pension when she retired which to date has not happened. I had been under the assumption that any monies owed would be resolved 4 at that time. These money equations were to be worked out by our corresponding attorneys.1 Applicant admitted the debt o",

RICCIARDELLO \n \nAppearances \n \nFor Government: Eric Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Fred Grafstein, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 7, 2008, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nfile of relevant material (FORM) on May 1, 2008. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on \nMay 7, 2008, and it was received on May 19, 2008. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant\u2019s case was assigned to me on July 7, 2008, and the file was forwarded to me \non the same day. The file indicated Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not \nsubmit additional information. I issued my decision on July 28, 2008. On August 27, \n2008, Applicant filed a motion for expedited remand for the Administrative Judge to \nconsider Applicant\u2019s original response to the FORM which \u201capparently had not been \ntaken into account.\u201d The evidence was never provided to me. On September 4, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel filed a response to Applicant\u2019s motion stating he had no objection \nto the request for an expedited remand. The case was remanded to me on October 3, \n2008, ordering the case to be remanded \u201cfor further processing.\u201d  \n \n \nOn October 6, 2008, I ordered Department Counsel to provide me by October 9, \n2008, the complete copy of the \u201cResponse to Form and accompanying documents\u201d that \nwere dated May 20, 2008, as were referred to by Applicant. On October 7, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel complied with my order, providing me the documents, his \nresponse that he did not object to the documents and a written argument. The letter and \nemails from Department Counsel are marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The evidence \nprovided is marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1 through 11. Additional \ncorrespondence and Department Counsel\u2019s response to the evidence was marked as \nHE II. On October 8, 2008, a conference call was conducted with Department Counsel, \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel and myself. Applicant\u2019s Counsel requested he be permitted to \nprovide additional evidence based on Department Counsel\u2019s response in HE II. \nAlthough I did not rule that Department Counsel\u2019s submission constituted new evidence, \nI reopened the case to allow Applicant to provide additional evidence. He was ordered \nto provide to Department Counsel any additional relevant evidence not later than \nOctober 20, 2008. Department Counsel was ordered to provide the documents and his \nresponse to me not later than October 22, 2008. I received additional evidence from \nApplicant that is marked as AE 12. Department Counsel did not object and reiterated his \nprior argument. His response was marked as HE III. \n \n \nI have considered all of Applicant\u2019s submissions in addition to all of the evidence \npreviously provided. To ensure completeness I have listed below all of the exhibits, AE \n1 through 12 that I have considered. I have also considered all of the evidence \npreviously provided in the FORM.  \n \n \n1.

They are incorporated \nherein. In addition, I have thoroughly and carefully reviewed all of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted. I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and served as a police officer for 20 years attaining the \nrank of Detective. He retired in 1993 and has held various jobs since then. He \nexperienced periods of unemployment from May 1999 to September 1999 and May \n2006 to December 2006. He has been employed as a contract investigator with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor since December 2006. Applicant was married from \n1970 to 2003. He has three adult children.  \n \n \nA judgment was entered against Applicant in favor of his ex-wife as alleged in \nSOR \u00b61.a in the approximate amount of $23,348. The judgment has been owed since \nAugust 2004. It is a debt for a portion of Applicant\u2019s pension to be paid to his ex-wife \npursuant to a divorce decree. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR regarding the debt is as \nfollows:  \n \nThe monies in question were the result of a default judgment found \nagainst me while I lived in [Place A]. She was and has been receiving 47 \npercent of my law enforcement pension and I was to receive 47 percent of \nher teaching pension when she retired which to date has not happened. I \nhad been under the assumption that any monies owed would be resolved \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nat that time. These money equations were to be worked out by our \ncorresponding attorneys.1 \n \nApplicant admitted the debt of $1,739 owed in SOR \u00b6 1.b and claimed it was in \nthe process of being paid off by monthly payments when the payments were halted due \nto the default judgment listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a, that froze his funds and payments. He \nstated in his affidavit that that account is now a problem.2 \n \nApplicant provided documentation that shows automatic deductions are taken \nfrom his pension and paid to his ex-wife as of December 24, 2004, pursuant to their \ndivorce settlement.3 However the amount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for arrearages owed \nfrom February 28, 2003 to May 14, 2004, plus an additional amount awarded for \ncounsel fees. This judgment was entered in default. Applicant\u2019s original divorce \nattorney, Attorney A, sent Applicant a letter on September 2, 2004, advising him that a \nmoney judgment in the amount of $20,848 representing the arrearage and attorney fees \nwas entered against him on August 25, 2004.4 The letter dated September 2, 2004 to \nApplicant stated the following: \n \nThe decision indicates that you did not respond to the motion for the \nmoney judgment. My office was never served with any motion as the \nprocedure requires that you be served since your divorce judgment has \nalready been entered by the Court and any new application is considered \nto be post-judgment and requires service upon you and not this office as \nyour former attorney.  \n \nIf you were not served with the motion seeking the money judgment then \nyou should contact my office to discuss whether or not you wish to make \napplication to modify or reverse the judgment. Of course you will need to \nbe able to substantiate that you have made payments to your ex-wife or \nthat the amount that you owe is less than the amount granted in the \ndecision of the Court.  \n \nIf you have any further questions regarding this matter please do not \nhesitate to contact my office.5  \n \nApplicant changed Attorneys in 2005 and hired Attorney B.6 Applicant provided an \nInvoice from Attorney B dated August 22, 2005, that states: \n \n1 Item 2. \n \n2 AE 12. \n \n3 AE 10. \n \n4 AE 5. \n \n5 AE 4. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n7/29/2005-Telephone: Finally made contact with attorney for ex-wife will \nnot settle for [just] a mere offset [wants] money to settle judgments-also \nhas counsel fee awards-doesn\u2019t know exact amount-will provide me with \ndocumentation once I send letter of representation. \n \nOn October 7, 2007, Attorney B again contacted Attorney A and stated he was trying to \nresolve for Applicant the open arrears to his ex-wife. He acknowledged he was \nunsuccessful in doing so in 2005.7  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s affidavit dated October 16, 2008, he stated: \n \n[M]y pension that I received as a retired [X] County Police Office[r] went \ninto payout status before the divorce became final. My wife\u2019s pension did \nnot go into payout status and is still not in payout status and has not \nbe[en] evaluated. I bring this to the attention of this court because of the \nfact that there are set offs that still have to be negotiated with regard to my \nwife\u2019s entitlement to the money she is claiming and the monies I would be \nentitled to by virtue of my long term employment as a police officer. \n \nAppellant went on to say in his affidavit the following: \n \nAfter the sale of our home, I relocated to the State of [Y] and left \neverything in the hands of my then divorce counsel. My attorney was to \nbring to a conclusion the open issues involving the distribution of my \nproperty resulting from my marriage. Unbeknownst to me, an application \nwas made to the court for a money judgment to be entered against me for \narrears that had accrued under a temporary order directing that my wife \nwas to receive a specified sum each month from the pension that was in \npayout status to me directly. I was unaware that these monies continued \nto accrue or that a judgment had been entered. My pension check, was \nreceived by direct deposit into an account held at the [County] Federal \nCredit Union. A restraining notice was served on the [County) Federal \nCredit Union and my account was frozen. When I submitted my copy of \nthe restraining notice with the other exhibits, it was for the express \npurpose of showing that the issuance of the restraint interrupted the \nrepayment of an indebtedness to the credit union. An execution apparently \nwas never served on the credit union and the account is still restrained. \nMeanwhile the loan that I had with the [c]redit [u]nion has defaulted and is \na problem for me as well. I authorize my current attorney to address that \nproblem while also attempting to juggle other expenses I was incurring \nwith my current income.8   \n \n6 AE 7. \n \n7 AE 9. \n \n8 AE 12. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe debt of $323 in SOR \u00b6 1.c is for telephone services. Applicant claimed in his \nanswer that the telephone debt was the result of an ongoing dispute he had with the \ntelephone company because of \u201cimproper services I received from them, improper \nequipment I received and a lack of concern on their part over the quality of service I was \nreceiving from them.\u201d9 In documentation provided he noted that his attorney told him to \npay the debt to resolve it.10 He offered no evidence that he has done so.  \n \n \nApplicant originally stated he had no knowledge about the debt of $197 listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.11 He claimed his account records indicate his prompt payment to this \ncreditor until he moved and closed the account. In his affidavit he stated he had \nresolved the utility debt, but did not offer any documentation to support his claim.12 \n \n \nApplicant stated he provided the aforementioned documentation to show he was \nbeing responsive to creditors and he is \u201cgenerally a responsible individual.\u201d13 He further \nstated that his period of divorce and the short time after was extremely difficult and hard \nfor him and their children. He and his ex-wife have reconciled their problems with the \nchildren and with each other \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n \n9 Answer to SOR. \n \n10 AE 2. \n \n11 Answer to SOR. \n \n12 AE 12. \n \n13 Id. \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them, especially AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant has a default \njudgment against him that despite being aware of it and its effect on his other debts he \nhas not resolved. The default judgment is four years old. He also has other debts and \nhe has not provided documentation that he paid or resolved them. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions. I especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d); and (e) (\u201cthe individual has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d). \n \n \nApplicant is aware that he has a legally binding default judgment entered against \nhim for approximately $23,348. He is aware of his responsibility toward paying this \njudgment. He apparently believes that somehow this dispute will be resolved at a later \ndate. No evidence was provided to show this matter will be resolved later. Although he \nstated he was unaware of the default judgment, he also provided a letter from his \ndivorce attorney advising him of the judgment and to contact him if he wanted to dispute \nit. No evidence was provided to show he has legally disputed the judgment in court. He \napparently was attempting some type of off-set with his ex-wife\u2019s pension, a proposal \nthat was refused. Applicant\u2019s proposal was declined three years ago. He failed to \nprovide any documented evidence to show he does not owe the debt or is paying the \ndebt. The debt is for arrearages owed. According to Applicant\u2019s statements, his ex-\nwife\u2019s pension is not yet being paid out. Therefore, it is unclear how he would be in a \nposition to off-set the pensions.  \n \n \nApplicant also claimed that because of the judgment entered against him his \npayments on another debt were frozen. Again he did not offer any evidence to show \nthat since the debt was frozen he has done anything to resolve either of the debts. He \nhas failed to offer any substantive evidence to show he is resolving his debts. He has \nnot provided any documents to support he paid or resolved the remaining debts or is \nformally disputing them. I find (a) does not apply because the debts remain delinquent. I \nhave considered (b), but find it does not apply because Applicant has been aware of the \ncourt ordered judgment and has not complied with it. Although the circumstances of \nsome of the debts were the result of his divorce, he has had several years to resolve \nthem and has not addressed them in the proper forum. There has not been sufficient \nevidence presented to confirm there has been a good-faith effort to pay his creditors, \nresolve the debts, or provide documented proof to substantiate his disputes. I find none \nof the remaining mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant acknowledged and \nadmitted his delinquent debts. He has not provided substantive evidence of efforts he \nhas made to resolve or pay the debts. I have considered all of the evidence presented. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Michael Lyles, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJanuary 23, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines J, E, G and F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 25, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 14, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn or about November 1981, applicant was arrested and charged with (1)\nBreaking and Entering with Intent to Steal and (2) Theft. He was convicted of the Theft\ncharge and fined.  \nIn or about December 1981, applicant was arrested and charged with (1)\nBreaking and Entering and (2) Theft, both felonies.\nIn or about February 1982, applicant was arrested and charged with Malicious\nDestruction of Property. He was convicted of the charge and sentenced to one year in\njail.\nIn or about February 1982, applicant was charged with (1) Breaking and Entering\nand (2) Theft.\nIn 1984, applicant was arrested and charged with Theft three separate times.\nThere is no credible evidence that any of the arrests resulted in a conviction.\nIn 1985, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Disorderly Conduct and\nProwling and (2) Loitering. He was convicted and sentenced to two days in jail.\nIn 1986, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence\n(DUI), (2) Driving While License Suspended or Revoked, and (3) Reckless Driving. The\nDUI charge was dropped, and applicant was convicted of the other two charges. He\nwas sentenced to one day in jail.\nIn 1987, applicant was arrested and charged with Contempt of Court in\nconnection with a prior reckless driving case against him.\nIn 1988, applicant was arrested for, charged with, and convicted of Burglary and\nPossession of Burglary tools, both felonies, and sentenced to three months in jail.\nIn 1990, applicant was convicted of selling or consuming alcoholic beverages on\ncity property and was sentenced to one day in jail.\nIn 1991, applicant was convicted of Driving with No Valid Drivers License and\nwas sentenced to two days in jail.\nIn 1992, applicant was twice convicted of Driving While License Suspended or\nRevoked. He was sentenced to two days in jail on the first conviction and ten days in jail\non the second.\nApplicant is indebted to the IRS in the approximate amount of $17,773.00 for\nback taxes.\n\n3\nApplicant is indebted to NCO Financial in the approximate amount of $1,442.00\non an account that was referred for collection.\nApplicant is indebted to AAC in the approximate amount of $3,338.00 on an\naccount that was referred for collection.\nApplicant is indebted to ACE on an account that is more than 180 days\ndelinquent in the approximate amount of $300.00.\nApplicant attached to his SOR response a copy of a money order in the amount\nof $100.00 made payable to the IRS. He provided no explanation.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s multiple convictions raise this disqualifying\ncondition.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I have considered each of them and conclude none apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAll of the Guideline E factual allegations, except for applicant\u2019s three driving-\nrelated criminal charges in 1991 and 1992,  were alleged under Guideline J. There is no\nlegitimate reason why these three criminal offenses were not included with all of the\nother criminal conduct alleged under Guideline J. Because this is not a legally proper\nuse of Guideline E, it is found for applicant.\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in Paragraph 21 of the\nAG, and is as follows:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe  evidence the Government offered in support of its case under Guideline G is\nthat (1) in 1986, applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, and the charge was\ndismissed, and (2) in 1990, he was convicted of selling or consuming alcoholic\nbeverages on city property. A 20+ year old DUI charge without a conviction and a low\nlevel alcohol-related conviction over 17 years ago that might or might not have involved\nalcohol consumption, do not establish a prima facie case under Guideline G. This\nguideline is therefore found for applicant.\n\n5\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of not paying his\ndebts.  Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nI considered all of the potentially mitigating factors under Guideline F and\nconclude none apply.\nWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man with a\nlong history of serious criminal conduct and financial delinquencies. Although the\npassage of time since his last criminal activity occurred is a factor in his favor, he\noffered no positive evidence of reform from people who know him well. Without such\nevidence, I cannot conclude that his criminal conduct will not recur. With respect to his\nfinancial delinquencies, applicant provided no explanation for them, and offered little to\nno credible evidence of any meaningful action to address them. Based on the foregoing,\nI conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guidelines F\nand J.\n\n6\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline G: FOR APPLICANT\nParagraph 4, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant was born in Taiwan and immigrated to the U.S. in 1986 at the age of 24 to pursue his graduate studies (R.T., at 67). Before immigrating to the U.S., he was conscripted into the Taiwan military and served as an army officer in Taiwan\u2019s national army (see ex. 2; R.T., at 67, 90). He studied engineering at a recognized U.S. university and earned his masters degree in 1988 (R.T., at 77). After completing advanced engineering program, he returned to Taiwan (in 1989), where he worked for about a year for a private Taiwan company as a sales engineer (R.T., at 77-79). He held this job for about two months before changing employers (R.T., at 79). After working for a couple firms he returned to school at a local Taiwan college, while working on obtaining a green card that would enable him to return to the U.S. Applicant returned to the U.S. in 1990 on the strength of a green card and quickly applied for U.S. citizenship. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 48), and earned his PhD degree in 2005 (R.T., at 84-85)..

The\ncase was assigned to me on August 27, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on October\n8, 2008.  A hearing was held on October 8, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether\nit would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.)\nNovember 25, 2008\n\n2\nwas received on October 16, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is denied.\nBesides its three exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of 14\ndocuments.  Covered documents include  Background Note: Taiwan, U.S. Department of\nState (March 2008); Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices,\nCongressional Research Service, Library of Congress (May 2008); ; Intelligence Threat\nHandbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS)\n(June 2004), Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial\nEspionage 2000, National Counterintelligence Center; Annual Report to Congress on\nForeign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2005.\nOther documents covered by the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice\nentail: National Counterintelligence Executive; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of\nIndustry and Commerce (August 2006); California Exporter Fined in Connection with\nAttempted Taiwan Export (September 1999);  U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of\nIndustry and Commerce, Commerce Department Imposes Civil Penalty on Minnesota firm\nin Settlement of Export Violations (December 2001); U.S. Department of Commerce,\nBureau of Industry and Commerce, Connecticut Company Settles Charges Concerning\nUnlicensed Pump Exports to China, Taiwan, Israel, and Saudi Arabia (July 2003); U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Emcore Corporation\nSettles Charges of Export Control Violations (January 2004); U.S. Department of\nCommerce, Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Parker Hannifan Corp.

See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.   See Stein, Administrative Law,\nSec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Taiwan.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.  This notice did  not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Taiwan\u2019s current state.  \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested to leave the record open to\nsupplement materials covering recent reports of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.  There being\n\n3\nno objections from Department Counsel, and for good cause shown, Applicant was\nafforded seven days to October 7, 2008 to supplement the record.  The Government was\ngranted to October 25, 2008 to respond.\n Within the time permitted, Applicant supplement the record with documentation of\nthe following articles relating to recent arms shipments to Taiwan from the U.S.: a web\nmemo published by the Heritage Foundation (October 2008), an International Herald\nTribune article (October 2008), a www.newsvine.com article (October 2008), and a\nboston.com article (October 2008) article.  Department Counsel objected to the admission\nof these news articles, citing accuracy flaws that preclude their being received pursuant to\nthe administrative notice rules (see Fed. R. Evi. 201).  The articles cover generally\nreported news releases regarding recent U.S. arms shipments to Taiwan.  While their\nsources are insufficiently reliable to permit administrative notice of the sources and\ncontents, they are reported by generally respected and reliable news publications.\nApplicant\u2019s submissions, accordingly, are admitted as evidence to be assigned the weight\nthey deserve under DOHA\u2019s less stringent evidentiary standards. Applicant\u2019s submissions\nare admitted as exhibits B through F.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to have (a) exercised dual citizenship with\nthe U.S. and Taiwan, (b) maintained a valid Taiwan passport that was issued in March\n2002 and is not due to expire until March 2012, (c) applied for and was issued a\nTaiwanese passport in March 2002 even though he became a naturalized, U.S. citizen in\n1996, (d) and used his Taiwanese passport instead of his U.S. passport to travel to\nTaiwan in 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007.\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged (a) to have a sister who is a citizen and\nresident of Taiwan, (b) to have a mother-in-law and father-in-law who are citizens and\nresidents of Taiwan and \u00a9) to have traveled to Taiwan in 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the allegations.  He\nadmitted to possessing a Taiwan passport that was issued in March 2002 and is not due\nto  expire until March 2012.  He admitted to becoming a naturalized citizen in 1996 and to\ntraveling to Taiwan in 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007 using his Taiwan passport instead of\nhis U.S. passport (claiming his use of his Taiwan passport enabled him to keep his one-\nyear old son for more than 30 days).\nApplicant also admitted to having a sister who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan\n(one of four sisters), while claiming  three other sisters who are naturalized citizens and\nresidents to the U.S.  And Applicant admitted to having a mother-in-law and father-in-law\nwho are citizens and residents of Taiwan.   But Applicant expressed uncertainty over the\nmeaning of exercising dual citizenship and denied any application of the core Guideline B\nconcerns to his situation.\n\n4\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old lead mechanic engineer for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born in Taiwan and immigrated to the U.S. in 1986 at the age of 24\nto pursue his graduate studies (R.T., at 67).  Before immigrating to the U.S., he was\nconscripted into the Taiwan military and served as an army officer in Taiwan\u2019s national\narmy (see ex. 2; R.T., at 67, 90).  He studied engineering at a recognized U.S. university\nand earned his masters degree in 1988 (R.T., at 77).  After completing advanced\nengineering program, he returned to Taiwan (in 1989), where he worked for about a year\nfor a private Taiwan company as a sales engineer (R.T., at 77-79).  He held this job for\nabout two months before changing employers (R.T., at 79).  After working for a couple\nfirms he returned to school at a local Taiwan college, while working on obtaining a green\ncard that would enable him to return to the U.S.\nApplicant returned to the U.S. in 1990 on the strength of a green card and quickly\napplied for U.S. citizenship.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996 (see ex. 1;\nR.T., at 48), and earned his PhD degree in 2005 (R.T., at 84-85)..  After becoming a U.S.\ncitizen, he retained his Taiwan passport for convenience reasons (see ex. 2).  Applicant is\nmarried and has two children: a daughter (age 5) and a son (age 7).  His wife (W) is also\na naturalized citizen.  Like Applicant, W and his two children each maintain dual\ncitizenship and retain Taiwan passports (R.T., at 85-86).\nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased.  During his early growth years in Taiwan, his\nfather served as the president of a local college, and his mother was an elementary\nschool teacher (R.T., at 66-68).  He has a brother (B) who has dual U.S.-Taiwan\ncitizenship and has a listed residence in the U.S. (see ex.1; R.T., at 88-89).  B is a retired\nmanufacturing engineer with a PhD from a prestigious American university who returned\nto Taiwan in 1995 to reside (R.T., at 61-63, 72). B served in the Taiwan military before\nimmigrating to the U.S., but has never worked for the Taiwan government or  military\n(R.T.,a t 103).  Applicant has a sister (S), too, who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan\n(R.T., at 61-63).  She is a retired elementary school teacher who receives a state\nteachers pension (see ex. 2; R.T., at 103-04).  He has three other sisters as well, who are\nnaturalized citizens and residents of the U.S. (see ex. 1; R.T., at 57-60, 73-74).\nAfter becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen and obtaining a U.S. passport (see ex. 3,\nat 30), Applicant never renounced his Taiwan citizenship (see ex. 2).  He applied for and\nreceived a renewed Taiwan passport in March 2002 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 48-50).  This\npassport is not due to expire until March 2012.  Applicant used both his Taiwan passport\nand U.S. passport) to travel to Taiwan in 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007 to check out\nconditions for placing his one-year son with his grandparents during the summer months\n(see ex. 2, at 15 and ex. 3, at 16; R.T., at 50-52, 68, 94-96).  Applicant used his Taiwan\n\n5\npassport once again in 2008 to travel with his son to Taiwan (R.T., at 92-93).  He\nexplained that were he to have used his U.S. passport exclusively, he would not have\nbeen permitted to keep his son in Taiwan with his grandparents for more than 30 days. To\nobtain the necessary waiver to stay in Taiwan for more than 30 days, it would have been\nnecessary for him to travel some distance to see a Taiwan consulate (R.T., at 92).  So,\nfor convenience purposes, he elected to travel to Taiwan on his Taiwan passport, with his\nU.S. passport in reserve.  When traveling to countries other than Taiwan, he documents\nusing his U.S. passport exclusively, citing his use of his U.S. passport to enter and exit\nIndonesia and the PRC as examples of his sole reliance on his U.S. passport (see ex. 3;\nR.T., at 55-56). \nApplicant remains in regular contact with his brother and sister in Taiwan.  He\nexchanges e-mails with B and S several times a month (R.T., at 101-05).  He sees B and\nS on his visits to Taiwan, and when S makes her annual visits to the U.S. (R.T., at 100-\n04).  S provides some school advances for Applicant\u2019s son (R.T., at 104).  \nApplicant maintains a Taiwan bank account and uses this account to repay S\u2019s\nadvances with wire transfers.  He opened his first account in 2004 (R.T., at 113-14).\nBecause this account is quite small, he opened another account in 2007 when he visited\nhis sister in Taiwan.  Like his 2001 bank account, his 2007 account is also quite small\n(R.T.,a t 106-07).  Besides these two bank accounts, Applicant has a property inheritance\nfrom his father.  This inherited property consists of an apartment house (4  floor of a\nth\nseven-floor building).  He does not know the value of his property interest in this building.\nWhile he does not need this property, he is not willing to relinquish it.  He wants to retain\nthis foreign property interest out of concern that his relinquishing it could prompt a fight\nover the  interest with his sisters (R.T., at 123-24).\nBefore his death in 2007, Applicant\u2019s father set up a trust for his children.  B\nmanages this trust which has about $100,000.00 in liquid assets in the trust\u2019s account\n(R.T, at 129).  B sends Applicant $10,000.00 a year from the trust R.T., at 128-30).\nApplicant does not know B\u2019s trust title or whether the $10,000.00 he receives represents\ninterest earned or invasion of principal (R.T., at 130-31).  \nW\u2019s parents also reside in Taiwan.  W\u2019s mother is a retired owner of a truck\nmaintenance and repair business; her father is a retired bank manager (see ex. 2; R.T., at\n107-08).  W sends her parents money every six months.  She, too, has a sister who\nresides in the U.S.  When Applicant and W travel to Taiwan, they sometimes stay with\nW\u2019s in-laws.  Likewise, W\u2019s parents stay with Applicant and W when they visit them in the\nU.S. (ex. 2; R.T., at 110-11). While Applicant talks with W\u2019s in-laws occasionally, W\ncommunicates with them monthly (R.T., at 112).  \nAt this time, Applicant remains unwilling to renounce his Taiwan citizenship and\nsurrender his Taiwan passport (see ex. 2; R.T., at 138).  He is willing to consider\nrelinquishing his Taiwan citizenship and surrendering his Taiwan passport only if it is\nnecessary to obtain his security clearance, and not otherwise (R.T., at 138-39).\nApplicant\u2019s offer is a conditional one and may not be considered either an effective\n\n6\ndemonstration of a renouncement of his Taiwan citizenship or a completed surrender of\nhis Taiwan passport.  \n Taiwan\u2019s country status\nTaiwan has a rich history that dates back 12 to 15 thousand years.  Dutch and\nSpanish colonists claimed the island in the 16  and 17  centuries (see Background Note:\nth\nth\nTaiwan, U.S. Department of State (March 2008).  Migration from the Chinese mainland\nover time supplanted the  aboriginal peoples of Taiwan.  Japan exerted considerable\ninfluence over Taiwan following China\u2019s ceding of Taiwan to Japan in 1895 (see\nBackground Note: Taiwan, id, at 3).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Taiwan reverted to Chinese rule.  Civil\nwar erupted soon after the reversion between Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s KMT government and\nthe increasingly influential Chinese Communist Party guided by Mao Zedong.  When the\ncivil war ended in 1949, 2 million refugees (predominantly nationalists) fled to Taiwan,\nwhere Chiang Kai-Shek established a separate provisional KMT capital in Taipei (see\nBackground Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3). Mao\u2019s victorious Communist party, in turn,\nestablished the People\u2019 s Republic of China (PRC).\nFor the past one-half century, Taiwan has demonstrated steady economic\ndevelopment and now is a major international trading power.  Its accession to the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) in 2002 represented a significant achievement and\nstrengthened its standing in the expanding global economy. \nTaiwan exhibited steady political development as well since its establishment as an\nisland government. Changes reflect a continuing liberalizing process that culminated in\nthe tightly contested election of Chen Shui-bian in 2000 (see Background Note: Taiwan,\nsupra, at 3).   Chen\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won major parliamentary\nvictories in 2000 and again in 2004, enabling Chen to become the first opposition party\ncandidate to win the presidency.  Chen was re-elected in 2004 on a platform that included\na \u201cdefensive referendum\u201d (Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 6).  Such referenda have\nbeen historically perceived to be closely linked to the question of Taiwan\u2019s independence.\nHistorically, the DPP has maintained that Taiwan is an entity separate from mainland\nChina, a marked contrast from Taiwan\u2019s opposition parties who stress that Taiwan\n(though currently divided) is a part of \u201cone China\u201d (see id.).  \nIn March 2008, Taiwan elected a new president (Ma Ying-jeou) in a landslide\nelection (see ex. D, International Tribune article, China Strongly Criticizes US Arms Sale\nto Taiwan, Associated Press (October 2008)).  Ma committed to improved relations with\nthe PRC.  His policies, as framed, marked a determined shift from the independence track\npursued by his predecessor, Chen (see id.).  Historically, the PRC has strongly opposed\nChen\u2019s efforts to push for Taiwan\u2019s independence.  These Chen efforts wrought repeated\nadmonitions from U.S. officials and renewed strains in U.S.-Taiwan relations (see Taiwan:\nRecent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, Congressional Research Service, Library\nof Congress, supra, at 8, 15-16).  \n\n7\nToday\u2019s Taiwan political system is a multi-party democracy under a Constitutional\numbrella comprising five branches: executive, legislative, judicial, control and\nexamination.  Taiwan\u2019s reported human rights record and demonstrated respect for the\nrule of contract in its commercial relations is quite good.\nTaiwan\u2019s PRC relations\nThe PRC does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is only\n \u201cone China\u201d (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 6).  Despite differences over the \nPRC\u2019s one China policy, Taiwan and the PRC have enjoyed increased contacts over the\npast decade. With Taiwan\u2019s continued relaxation of its PRC policy regarding unofficial\ncontacts, cross-strait interactions have grown significantly.  Efforts by the PRC, however,\nto resume cross-strait dialogue without any preconditions have been hampered by the\nPRC\u2019s insistence that the two sides first reach consensus that there is only \u201cone China\u201d\nbefore restarting talks (see id.).  Cheng has recognized the PRC\u2019s \u201cone China\u201d insistence\nbut to date has declined to condone the concept.  With both sides unwilling to\ncompromise this obstacle, they have cautiously felt each other out with smaller\nintermediary steps like cross-Strait cargo and passenger charter flights, sale of Taiwan\nagricultural products in the PRC, and PRC tourists visiting Taiwan (see id).  \nThe PRC operates a large and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the MSS\n(see Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency\nOPSEC Support Staff (IOSS), at 71 (June 2004)).  The MSS maintains active intelligence\ngathering operations in Taiwan (see id., at 72).  These operations use clandestine agents\nto collect intelligence on Western consortia investing in the PRC who are suspected of\ninvolvement in attempts to democratize the PRC, as well as other pro-democracy groups\nthought to be engaging in anti-communist activities (see Intelligence Threat Handbook,\nsupra, at 72). \nIn the current political environment, it is still too early to predict the direction of\ncross-Strait negotiations between Taiwan and the PRC.  Because of the PRC\u2019s long\ninsistence on Taiwan\u2019s acceptance of the \u2018one China\u201d principle as a requisite to any jump-\nstarting of negotiations over practical agreements in trade, cultural exchanges, and other\nareas of mutual interest, future relations between the two sides remain cloudy at best.\nCurrent options for Ma and PRC premier Wen Jiabao include PRC support of meaningful\nTaiwan participation in the WHO, the jump-starting of cross-Strait talks, and the dropping\nof PRC objections to Taiwan participation in other multilateral organizations (see Taiwan:\nRecent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, Congressional Research Service, Library\nof Congress, supra, at 16)\nFor U.S. policy, Ma\u2019s election does present an auspicious opportunity to develop a\nnew framework in Taiwan-PRC relations (see id.).  Recent high level talks between the\nPRC and Taiwan reveal hopes for reduced tensions and better relations through\nincreased trade and a formal renunciation of the independence option of Ma\u2019s\npredecessor (see ex. E, newsvine article, U.S.-Taiwan-China Relationship Back in\nBalance, Associated Press, at 2 (October 2008)).  Culminating their high level meetings,\n\n8\nthe PRC\u2019s envoy (Chen Yunlin) signed an agreement with Taiwan\u2019s Ma that expands air\nshipping and postal links between the island and the mainland.  These expanded contacts\noffer the promise of improving the prospects for peace and easing diplomatic strains\nbetween Taiwan and the U.S.\nU.S.-Taiwan relations\nIn a joint communique with the PRC in January 1979, the U.S. announced its\nrecognition of the PRC government as the sole government of China.  In this joint\ncommunique, the U.S. accepted that there is but one China, of which Taiwan is a part\n(see Background Note; Taiwan, supra, at 9).  The joint communique stated that within this\ncontext the people of the U.S. will maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial\nrelations with the people of Taiwan.\nTo implement the Joint communique, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act\n(TRA) in April 1979.  President Carter, in turn, signed the legislation into law on April 10,\n1979.  Besides providing the legal basis for maintaining the U.S. unofficial relationship\nwith Taiwan, the TRA reinforced the U.S. commitment to provide defense assistance to\nTaiwan.  The TRA expressly provides for the continued sale of appropriate defensive\nmilitary equipment to Taiwan and declares that peace and stability in the area are in U.S.\ninterests (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra).  Although the U.S. terminated its Mutual\nDefense Treaty with Taiwan following its de-recognition of the latter, it has continued its\nsale of appropriate defensive military equipment to Taiwan (see id.).\nWhile ambiguously written, the U.S. commitment to Taiwan\u2019s security against\ncross-Strait aggression by the PRC\u2019s military forces is implicit in the TRA\u2019s coverage of\nU.S. responsibilities towards Taiwan.  This implicit construction is oft-used to support\nproponents of a \u201ctwo China\u201d policy.  To be sure, initial actions of the Bush Administration\nin 2001 provided cause to conclude the new President had abandoned longstanding U.S.\npolicy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in favor of a policy that placed a clearer emphasis on\nTaiwan\u2019s interests at the expense of the PRC (see Taiwan: Recent Developments and\nU.S. Policy Choices, CRS Report to Congress, supra, at 13).  More recent developments,\nthough, reflect the smoothing of U.S.-PRC relations as a part of the broader war on\nterrorism.  \nCurrently, the U.S. does not support Taiwan independence and opposes unilateral\nsteps by either side to alter the status quo (see Background Note; Taiwan, supra, at 9).\nFor so long as Taiwan\u2019s national security remains under threat (both veiled and unveiled)\nfrom the PRC, Taiwan can be expected to pursue the development of its military amidst\nexpectations of military assistance from the U.S. Stressing self-reliance, Taiwan\nmaintains a large military establishment (accounting for 15.3 per cent of its central\nbudget).  Its principal mission is to defend itself against the PRC, which has not\nrenounced the use of force against Taiwan (see id, at 8).   With its unchanged public\npolicy of maintaining \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in its official relations with Taiwan, the U.S. can\nbe expected to continue its support of Taiwan\u2019s island security with the sale of defensive\nmilitary equipment.\n\n9\nTaiwan\u2019s economic collection practices\nBased on past reports to Congress, Taiwan is considered one of the most active\ncollectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information.  In its 2000 Annual Report to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, the preparers  list\nTaiwan as well as the PRC among the most active collectors based on cited surveys (see\n2000 Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial\nEspionage, National Counterintelligence Center (NACIC), at 16).  Specific incidents are\ncited in the NACIC Report that identify offenders of proprietary information thefts and\nattempts to acquire export-restricted products (see id., 7-10). \nRecent espionage convictions document ongoing collection activities covering theft\nof sensitive and proprietary information by and for Taiwan companies (see, e.g., Press\nRelease, United States v. Ching Kan Wang and Robin Chang, Case No. 05-60218-CR-\nSietz (SD Fla), Superceding Indictment (filed October 2005) and Judgment in a Criminal\nCase (filed March 2006); Press Release, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney (ED\nVA January 2007), and Statement of Facts (stipulated), No.1:05CR 543 (December\n2005)).\nBesides these above-cited individual convictions, there have been numerous\nreported cases of Taiwan business entities capitalizing on private acquisitions of sensitive\nU.S. technology which are adaptable to dual military applications (see, e.g., U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Commerce (August 2006); California\nExporter Fined in Connection with Attempted Taiwan Export (September 1999); U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Commerce Department\nImposes Civil Penalty on Minnesota firm in Settlement of Export Violations (December\n2001); U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Connecticut\nCompany Settles Charges Concerning Unlicensed Pump Exports to China, Taiwan,\nIsrael, and Saudi Arabia (July 2003); U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry\nand Commerce, Emcore Corporation settles Charges of Export Control Violations\n(January 2004); U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Commerce,\nParker Hannifan Corp. Settles Charges Pertaining to Illegal Exports to Taiwan and China,\n(November 2005).\nStress points between Taiwan, the PRC and the U.S.\nIn recent years, the PRC has aimed thousands of missiles across the Taiwan Strait\nfor the purpose of pressing Taiwan into eventual reunification.  Longstanding PRC\ndesigns on Taiwan reunification has entangled the U.S. in cross-Strait relations, because\nthe U.S. commitments to the Taiwan Relations Act has left unclear whether U.S. forces\nwould intervene to defend the island.\nIn October 2008, the U.S. announced its approval of a $6.4 billion U.S. arms sales\nto Taiwan (see ex. C, web memo published by the Heritage Foundation (October 2008).\nThe sales are reported to be modest efforts to neutralize the PRC\u2019s increasing military\n\n10\nadvantage over Taiwan in its cross-Strait relations.  The sales do not include Taiwan-\nrequested upgrades to its F-16C/D fighter aircraft to help ensure air balance or modern\ndiesel-electric submarines that can challenge PRC surface missiles.  What the sale\nprovides are apache helicopters and 330 Patriot \u201cadvanced capability\u201d missiles.  These\nmissiles are intended to help Taiwan meet the PRC\u2019s rapidly increasing short-range\nballistic missile (SRBM) fleets (1,400 in all) that are currently arrayed against Taiwan (see\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage\n2000, National Counterintelligence Center; Annual Report to Congress on Foreign\nEconomic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2005, National Intelligence Center).\nMany students of U.S.-Sino affairs view this modest arms sale as no more than a\nminimum maintenance of the status quo against the backdrop of a growing U.S.-PRC\npartnership relationship.  This view holds that U.S. security assurances mandated by the\nTaiwan Relations Act need to be considered and honored without regard to the PRC\u2019s\nviews on the subject.  This latest arms sale assessed in this light represents but another\nstep forward in the fulfillment of U.S. security pledges for Taiwan.  \nTo be sure, the PRC filed objections to the Taiwan arms sale (see ex. D, Intl\nHerald Tribune article, China Strongly Criticizes U.S. Arms Sale to Taiwan, Associated\nPress (October 2008).  Its foreign ministry cited reasons that the sale would interfere in\nthe development of peaceful relations between the PRC and the U.S. and undermines the\nU.S. publicly maintained \u201cone China\u201d policy and its promise to oppose Taiwanese\nindependence (see id.).  As expected, Taiwan\u2019s president (Ma Ying-jeou) welcomed the\nU.S. arms package as an important contribution towards ensuring a strong defense and\npeace in the Taiwan strait. \nIn balance, the recent U.S. arms sale to Taiwan represents a renewed U.S. effort\nto aid Taiwan\u2019s defenses, and improve the balance in the sometimes shaky three-way\nrelationship between the PRC, Taiwan, and the U.S. (see ex. E, newsvine article, U.S.-\nTaiwan-China Relationship Back in Balance, Associated Press (October 2008).  These\nefforts to ensure the maintenance of the status-quo in the Taiwan Strait does mean,\nhowever, that the U.S. is willing to back Taiwan\u2019s bid to participate in the UN.  This\nremains a controversial issue, and one vigorously opposed by the PRC, because of its\npotential for suggesting Taiwan is a sovereign state, separate from the mainland (see\nTaiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, Congressional Research\nService, supra, at 6-7).  In 2004, Congress did craft something of a middle ground for\nTaiwan when it enacted P.L 108-28 that required the Secretary of State to seek Taiwan\u2019s\nobserver status in the WHO at every annual meeting (see id, at 7).\nIn its November 2006 Report to Congress, the Security Review Commission\ndescribes the PRC as a country intent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge\ndeveloped by multiples of collection agents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by\nespionage (see 2006 Report to Congress, supra, at 138.  The PRC\u2019s concerted efforts to\nacquire sensitive technology poses a considerable challenge to U.S. counterintelligence\nmeasures.\n\n11\nRecent indictments of Chinese citizens for espionage have served to highlight the\nPRC\u2019s spying activities in the U.S. (see id.).  Violating  its own 2004 U.S.-China agreement,\nthe PRC oft-fails to schedule timely end-use inspection visits of dual-use items licensed for\nexport to the PRC.  Better export controls can be effective only if they are multilateral in\nscope (see id.).  Multilateral export controls and arms embargoes, however, do  provide\nadditional insurance against altering the cross-strait military balance that has been long\nmaintained (see id., at 144).\nOther stress points between Taiwan, the PRC, and the U.S. include PRC acquired\ndual use technologies with military potential from the U.S. and Taiwan through the U.S. and\nother source countries and the PRC\u2019s periodic military exercises in the Taiwan.  Reported\nintelligence, though, is lacking on any Taiwan use of its collection resources in the U.S. to\nsupply the PRC with needed military technology (alone or through technology with known\ndual use capabilities).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by administrative\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the\nadministrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the administrative judge to assess these factors\nexclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines,\nadministrative judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective, which are intended to assist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nfactors are pertinent herein:\n     Foreign Preference\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate \npreference    for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.  See AG, \u00b6 9.\n                     Foreign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests,\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization,\n\n12\nor government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under the this\nGuideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue   and\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to\ndo so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable\nand logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have\na material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to\naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified\ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must\ntake account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nsafeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan in 1986\nto pursue higher education goals.  Security concerns focus on members of Applicant\u2019s family\nand his retention of his Taiwan passport (indicative of a foreign preference) and immediate\nfamily (i.e., his brother, and sister) and in-laws who are citizens and residents of Taiwan, a\ncountry  historically friendly to the U.S., albeit, one with a reported history of economic\ncollection activities in the U.S.\n\n13\nForeign preference concerns\nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite critical\nconsiderations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of the foreign country\nover the interests of the U.S.  The issues, as such, raise concerns over Applicant\u2019s\npreference for a foreign country over the U.S.\nBy virtue of his birth in Taiwan to parents of Chinese ancestry, Applicant acquired\nTaiwan citizenship and passport, which he continued to retain even after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen in 1996 and was thereupon free to renounce his foreign citizenship and relinquish his\nforeign passport at any time of his choosing.   Until this hearing, he consistently declined to\nrelinquish his Taiwan  passport because of the convenience it afforded him when he traveled\nto Taiwan to visit his family.  Since becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant has taken\nmultiple actions and exercised Taiwanese privileges that can be fairly characterized as active\nindicia of dual citizenship.  Specifically, he renewed his Taiwan passport in 2002 and traveled\non his Taiwan passport on multiple occasions between 2002 and 2008 to visit his family and\nplace his son with family members in Taiwan for extended periods.  In fairness to Applicant,\nhe holds no assets in Taiwan, retains no other Taiwan privileges, and has never (save for his\npossession and use of his Taiwan passport) performed or attempted to perform duties, or\notherwise acted so as to serve the interests of Taiwan or the PRC in preference to the\ninterests of the U.S. since becoming a U.S. citizen.\nBecause Applicant continued to possess his Taiwan passport after becoming a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen, the Government may apply disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a) of\nAG \u00b6 9, \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after becoming a\nU.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not\nlimited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits\nfrom a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another\ncountry;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and\n(7) voting in a foreign election.\u201d  \n\n14\n To be fair, Applicant offers to surrender his passport, if his doing so would make a\ndifference in his getting a security clearance.  This offer is conditional, though, and\nconditional clearances are not available under the Adjudicative guidelines administered by\nDOHA.  So, for as long as Applicant elects to maintain his Taiwan citizenship and retain and\nuse his Taiwan passport to enter and exit Taiwan, he may not claim any of the mitigating\nconditions that might otherwise be available to him.  Accordingly, none of the mitigating\nconditions covered by Guideline C have any application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nFailure to satisfy a mitigating condition may be taken into account when assessing an\napplicant\u2019s overall claim of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, but may not\nbe turned into a disqualifying condition.  See ISCR Case No. 01-02270 (Appeal Bd. Aug. 29,\n2003).  That Applicant herein may wish to maintain his Taiwan citizenship and retain his\nTaiwan passport for convenience reasons only is not sufficient reason to enable him to\nmitigate security concerns over his retention of a foreign passport. \nWhole person precepts do not enable Applicant to surmount the Government\u2019s\npreference concerns herein.  Failure to indicate any intention to renounce his Taiwan\ncitizenship and surrender or destroy his Taiwan passport preclude him from documenting his\nundivided loyalty and preference for U.S. institutions and its way of life over those of his birth\ncountry (Taiwan), and indirectly the PRC.\nOverall, Applicant is unable to convince that his preference is with the U.S.  He fails to\nmeet his proof burden in several ways: lack of demonstrated non-exercise of any privileges\nassociated with his maintenance of his Taiwan citizenship and retention of his passport after\nhis naturalization as a U.S. citizen in 1996.  Applicant fails to absolve himself of foreign\npreference concerns and does not carry his evidentiary burden on the presented issue of\nwhether his preference lies with his adopted country (U.S.) or the country (Taiwan) where he\nwas born and raised as a minor through his parents\u2019 Taiwan citizenship.  Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through\n1.d of Guideline C.\nForeign influence concerns\nDepartment Counsel urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s siblings and\nin-laws residing in Taiwan might be subject to undue foreign influence by Taiwanese\ngovernment authorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.\nBecause Applicant\u2019s immediate family members and in-laws reside in Taiwan, they present\npotential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying condition  (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact\nwith a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication\nGuidelines for foreign influence. The citizenship/residence status of these immediate family\nmembers and in-laws in Taiwan pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the\nrisks of undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified information\nunder Applicant's possession and/or control. \n\n15\nBecause Applicant\u2019s brother and sister have some prior government links to Taiwan\n(schooling, employment, and pension entitlements, respectively), some consideration of \u00b6\nDC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information,\u201d is warranted as well.  Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings and in-\nlaws residing in Taiwan afford him some potential for accessing Taiwan officials who might\nbe interested in proprietary, sensitive, or even classified information that Applicant is privy to.\nStill, none of Applicant\u2019s family members have any identified affiliations or contacts with\nTaiwan officials currently known to be associated with intelligence or military organizations\ninterested in collecting proprietary or sensitive information in the U.S.  DC  \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d may\nhave some application, given the dual citizenship status of Applicant\u2019s family members and\nhis sharing living quarters with W\u2019s in-laws during their visits to Taiwan.\nBased on what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s  immediate\nfamily and in-laws residing in Taiwan have any political affiliations with Taiwan\u2019s  government\nor the PRC\u2019s military or intelligence organizations, or have any history to date of being\nsubjected to any coercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same.  Any risk of\nundue foreign influence on Applicant and/or his siblings and in-laws would appear to be\ninsubstantial, and clearly manageable ones.\nThe PRC, although a country reported to have targeted U.S. economic and proprietary\ninterests in the past, has shown considerable patience and reluctance to mount any\nforeseeable assaults on Taiwan\u2019s territorial, economic and political autonomy, or use its\nimmense intelligence powers to target specific Taiwan residents for the compromise of\nclassified or sensitive materials in the hands of relatives in the U.S. or NATO partners.  \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Taiwan. \nThe special relationship that has existed between the U.S. and Taiwan over the past\nhalf-century has been one marked by mutually reconcilable political and economic interests.\nReports of Taiwan intelligence gathering against U.S. companies are counterbalanced by\nTaiwan\u2019s history of friendship and partnership in a defense pact formalized in 1979.  The\nmutually supportive bonds that have linked Taiwan\u2019s special relationship with the U.S. have\nnot been weakened by either the TRA, or the  geopolitical forces that have shaped the U.S.\u2019s\nevolving relationship with the PRC.  Whatever potential security risks arise as the result of\nApplicant's having family members with citizenship and residency in Taiwan, they are\nmanageable ones which are mitigated. \n\n16\nTaiwan remains a friend of the U.S. and is a country whose democratic institutions are\nnot incompatible with our own traditions and respect for human rights and the rule of law.\nUnlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, the new ones do take into account the country\u2019s\ndemonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging whether the\nparticular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security\nrisk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter.\nTaiwan, while reported to target the U.S. and its companies in the past for economic and\nproprietary information, is still a country with no known recent history of hostage taking or\ndisposition for exerting undue influence against family members to obtain either classified\ninformation, or unclassified economic and proprietary data. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's siblings and in-\nlaws in Taiwan (a country historically friendly to the U.S) and relatively modest financial\ninterests in the country, any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign\ninfluence brought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or\nproprietary data out of Applicant through his family members residing in Taiwan is a\nmanageable one. Applicant, accordingly, may take advantage of one important mitigating\ncondition: MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d \nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to conflict of\ninterests with his Taiwan family members.  Not only has Applicant become a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen and received his advance professional training in the U.S., but he has made every\neffort to work, save, and pursue his financial interests exclusively in the U.S.  \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought to\nbear on any of his immediate family members and in-laws would appear to be minimal.  By\nall reasonable accounts of the presented record,  Applicant has no visible conflicts of interest\nwith Taiwan citizen/residents or property interests in Taiwan that could be at risk to\nexploitation or compromise by Taiwan authorities.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's immediate family\nmembers in Taiwan are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about\nApplicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his familial relationships\nin Taiwan.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nGuideline B.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole,\nincluding each of the factors and conditions enumerated in 2(a) of the Adjudicative Process\nof Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\n\n17\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance.\nGUIDELINE C: (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2:c\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's\nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 42 years old and divorced. He has an Associate Degree in Electronics. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer Technician II and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Statement of Reasons sets forth fourteen separate creditors totaling approximately $17,278.00. The Applicant admits allegations 1(a), 1(b), 1(e), 1(f), 1(g), 1(I), 1(j), 1(k), 1(l), 1(m) and 1(n) of the SOR. He denies allegations 1(c), 1(d) and 1(h) of the SOR.

Goldstein , Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 17, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLokey-Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on April 2, 2007. On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 8, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on May 2, 2008.  It was transferred to the undersigned on May 5,\n2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 13, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June\n17, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented five exhibits, referred to as\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 5.  The Applicant presented eleven exhibits, referred to\nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through K.  The Applicant called two witnesses and testified on\nhis own behalf.  The record remained open until July 21, 2008, to allow the Applicant to\nsubmit additional supporting documentation.  The Applicant submitted nine Post-\nHearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 9.  The\nofficial transcript (Tr.) was received on June 27, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\n\n2\nfille, pleadings, exhibits and testimony eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 42 years old and divorced.  He has an Associate Degree in\nElectronics.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer Technician II and\nis seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Statement of Reasons sets forth fourteen separate creditors totaling\napproximately $17,278.00.  The Applicant admits allegations 1(a), 1(b), 1(e), 1(f), 1(g),\n1(I), 1(j), 1(k), 1(l), 1(m) and 1(n) of the SOR.  He denies allegations 1(c), 1(d) and 1(h)\nof the SOR.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated April 10, 2007, January 7, 2008,\nJanuary 24, 2008, and April 24, 2008, reflect each of the delinquent debts listed in the\nSOR.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4 and 5).\nThe Applicant testified that as a result of a business loss of $11,000.00 when he\nwas self-employed from May to December of 2006, a period of disability from December\n2005 to May 2006, (caused by cracking several vertebrae in his neck), and a divorce in\nJuly 2004, he became excessively indebted and could not afford to pay his bills.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 7 and 8).  The divorce decree stated that he and his\nex-wife would jointly file bankruptcy to resolve the indebtedness from the marriage.  The\nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife filed Bankruptcy, but the Applicant did not.  As a result, all of the\ndebt from the marriage became his sole responsibility.   \nIn an effort to resolve his indebtedness, the Applicant contacted a consumer\ncredit counselor in February 2008, to assist in paying off his outstanding debts.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 9).  He made three initial payments of $219.40 a month\nwhich were electronically transferred from his bank account for the service.  The\nconsumer counselor had still done nothing to resolve the Applicant\u2019s indebtedness.  The\nApplicant then hired a second firm to assist him in his debt resolution.  After paying this\nfirm about $1,100.00, and receiving no service, he terminated his agreement with them\nand decided to handle his financial situation himself.  (Tr. pp. 48 - 53).  \nRather than pay his bills piece meal or a little at a time, the Applicant  borrowed\napproximately $14,000.00 from his parents to pay his bills.  He has paid all of the debt\nset forth in the SOR except allegations 1(f), 1(g), 1(j) and 1(k).  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\n\n3\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 and 2).  With regard\nto the outstanding debt, he has set up payment plans and is making regular monthly\npayments to resolve the indebtedness.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6\nand 8.  He plans to continue with the payments until he is completely debt free.  He is\ncurrent with all of his other monthly expenses, including his child support and alimony.\nHe is working overtime as much as possible to get his bills paid off sooner.   \nLetters of recommendation from professional colleagues of the Applicant attest to\nhis professionalism, dependability, high level of integrity and good judgment.  He is\nconsidered to be a valuable asset in the company.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).  \nThe Applicant\u2019s supervisor and a coworker testified on that the Applicant is\nconsidered punctual, responsible, knowledgeable, and a true asset to the company in\nevery respect.  (Tr. pp. 87 - 95). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\n4\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant his a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant\u2019s poor financial history was caused by a\ncombination of unfortunate events.  A business loss, a period of disability and a divorce\ncaused his excessive indebtedness.  With regard to this delinquent debt, the Applicant\nhas now either paid off the debt, or has set up payment plans and is making regular\nmonthly payments to resolve them.  He plans to continue paying the debt until it is paid\nin full.  In addition, he has reduced his spending and is working as much overtime as\npossible to get the debt resolved as quickly as possible.  He understands the\nimportance of paying his bills on time and not living beyond his means.  Under the\ncircumstances, he has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is\nevidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that he can\nproperly handle his financial affairs.  In the event that the Applicant does not continue to\npay his delinquent debts according to the payment plan or sooner if possible, his\nsecurity clearance will be in immediate jeopardy.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\n\n6\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 20.(c) the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and 20.(d) the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts also apply.    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nThis Applicant has paid or is currently paying his delinquent debt.  He has\ndemonstrated that he is trustworthy, and that he meets the eligibility requirements for\naccess to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 for the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On August 4, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Juan\nJ.

Applicant filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an accountant.  He is\nunmarried and has no children.  He encountered financial difficulties in 2001 and filed for Chapter\n7 bankruptcy protection.  He was discharged in bankruptcy late in the year.  Afterward he acquired\nadditional debt which became delinquent.  One debt was in the amount of $6,640.  Another was in\nthe amount of $10,975, and the third was for $420.

A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated May 2, 2008, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.5 Applicant did not provide additional documents within the 30 \ndays granted. On July 7, 2008, the case was assigned to me. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e with an explanation \nfor SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - c (Item 3).

He has never married. He does not have any \nchildren. He did not serve in the military. He attended several colleges during the last \nfive years. He has no police record. He has not used or trafficked in illegal drugs in the \nlast seven years, and has never used illegal drugs while in a sensitive position. In the \nlast seven years he has not been fired, quit or left employment under unfavorable \ncircumstances. \n \n \n \n \n3  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4  When he completed his SF 86, Applicant admitted he had filed for bankruptcy, and his car was \nrepossessed in 2004. See Item 4, Sections 27a and 27b. He denied he had any unpaid judgments in the \nlast seven years. See Item 4, Section 27d. He also denied having debts delinquent over 180 days in the \nlast seven years; and having debts currently delinquent over 90 days. See Item 4, Sections 28a and 28b.     \n \n5  The DOHA transmittal letter, is dated May 2, 2008; and Applicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated \nMay 7, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt \nto submit information. \n \n6  Item 4 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAround November 2001, Applicant had financial difficulties, and had to file for \nbankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy code (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) \n(Item 3). Shortly thereafter, Applicant acquired three debts that became delinquent, \ntotaling $18,000: (1) $6,640 placed for collection in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) \n$10,975 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and (3) $420 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). See also credit report dated February \n6, 2008, Item 8. He said the debt for $420 would be paid off by June 8, 2008 (Item 3). \nHe concluded his SOR response stating, \u201cI\u2019m able to live within my means and finances. \nI recently received a substantial pay increase that will help alleviate my debt ratio and \npay off remaining bills [in] a timely manner\u201d (Item 3).  \n \nIn his response to interrogatories, Applicant provided two $50 money orders \ndated February 26, 2008, one for each of the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b (Item 8 at \n3). In his SOR response he said he agreed with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a to make \npayments, and he made arrangements with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b to pay the balance \noff on a monthly basis (Item 3). Department counsel highlighted Applicant\u2019s failure to \nprovide proof of these payment arrangements in the FORM (FORM at 5 n. 17). \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM. He failed to present proof of an agreement with \nthe creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b; and more importantly, there is no proof that \nApplicant is complying with the terms of any such agreements.  \n \nApplicant completed a personal financial statement (PFS), which showed a gross \nmonthly salary of $4,540, total monthly deductions of $1,300, and a net monthly salary \nof $3,240 (Item 8). His monthly expenses total $1,790, which includes $700 monthly for \nautomobile expenses (Item 8). After subtracting monthly deductions, expenses and \ndebts, his PFS reflects a monthly negative cash flow of $17. His monthly debts are \nlisted as follows: \n \n \nCREDITOR \nTOTAL AMT \nOWED \nSCHED MO \nPMT \nACTUAL MO \nPMT \nMortgage \n$128,000 \n$1,217 \n$1,217 \nCredit Card Account $300 \n$50 \n$50 \nNot Listed \n$600 \n$100 \n$100 \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \n$14,000 \n$50 \n$50 \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \n$6,600 \n$50 \n$50 \n \n$149,500 \n$1,467 \n$1,467 \n \n \nA credit report dated February 6, 2008, lists an automobile loan for $14,927 with \na monthly payment of $440 for 73 months (Item 8). The 2008 credit report indicates this \ncar loan and his mortgage are current. It also lists a $17,500 student loan that is in \ndeferment (Item 8). \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                                          \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d7 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 \n \n \n7  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n8  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his SOR \nresponse, and his response to interrogatories. After his delinquent debts were \ndischarged in 2001, he accrued three additional debts, totaling approximately $18,000, \nthat became delinquent around 2002-2003. The three debts were delinquent as of the \ndate of the SOR. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                                          \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant made one $50 payment towards his $6,640 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and one \n$50 to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b slightly reducing his $10,975 debt. These two payments \nare insufficient to mitigate financial concerns pertaining to these two debts. He said he \npaid the $420 in SOR \u00b6 1.c. I will find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d for SOR \u00b6 1.c in the decretal \nparagraph of this decision. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to mitigate the SOR debts \nbecause they are not disputed. He did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate \nthe basis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d with \nrespect to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) \nbecause available information fails to establish he acted diligently and responsibly to \nresolve his delinquent debts.9 He failed to explain how he acquired the debts; why they \nbecame delinquent; what efforts he took to resolve his debts; or, any conditions beyond \nhis control that resulted in his financial problems (such as loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).  \n \nIt appears he began his attempts to resolve his delinquent debts in February \n2008. It is unclear whether he made any payments on any of these delinquent debts \nprior to February 2008, or whether he has made any payments since. These factors \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant received some financial \ncounseling in connection with his 2001 bankruptcy. However, there are not \u201cclear \n \n9  \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                                          \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d There is insufficient \ninformation to establish that Applicant applied the knowledge obtained from financial \ncounseling or that he showed good faith10 in the resolution of his debts. \n \nIn sum, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish he acted \nresponsibly and in good faith in the handling of his financial affairs. Based on his \nbudget, he does not have sufficient income remaining to make much progress on these \ntwo debts. His overall conduct with his creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His financial problems are continuing and likely to \nrecur. He should have been more diligent and made greater efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts, especially after receipt of the SOR. He has not carried his burden of \nproving his financial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a \nwhole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n10  The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. There is no evidence \nof any security violation. Aside from his delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal \nissue), he is a law-abiding citizen. His car loan and mortgage are current. The overall \namount of his delinquent debt at about $17,500 is relatively low. These factors show \nsome responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. His \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 provided him with the knowledge and opportunity for a \nfresh financial start. He was well aware of his financial responsibilities as his work \nexperience is primarily in the area of accounting. He learned of the security significance \nof these delinquent debts when he responded to interrogatories, and this knowledge \nwas reinforced when he received the SOR. His efforts to resolve his delinquent debts \nwere insufficient to fully resolve security concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to \nfinancial considerations. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has substantial delinquent debt that he cannot afford to repay. He\nclaimed he would file bankruptcy, but did not provide promised proof that he has done\nso. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on August 31, 2006. On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nJuly 25, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 12, 2008. He responded to\nthe SOR in writing (Answer) on March 28, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on April1, 2008. Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on April 18, 2008, and DOHA assigned the case to me on\nApril 24, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 24, 2008. Although Applicant did not\nsign and return his written receipt for the copy of the notice of hearing that was\nforwarded via his employer until May 1, 2008, he acknowledged on the record that he\nactually received the copy that was mailed directly to him at least 15 days prior to the\nhearing. (Tr. at 11.) I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 13, 2008. Department\nCounsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were admitted without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two other witnesses, and\nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection.\nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until June 13, 2008, in order for\nhim to submit additional documentation. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on May 22, 2008.  On June 12, 2008, Applicant submitted a letter from his\nbankruptcy attorney to Department Counsel, who forwarded it without objection to its\nconsideration. These documents were marked AE D, and Applicant did not submit any\nfurther evidence.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, applying for a\nsecurity clearance for the first time. In the Answer, Applicant admitted owing each of the\neight delinquent debts set forth in SOR \u00b6 1, totaling $299,046, that first became\ndelinquent between May 2003 and April 2006. (GE 2 through GE 8.) Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions are, with one exception, incorporated herein. The exception is that the\n$18,195 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.h is the same debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, as $25,562\nowing to the collection agency to whom the original credit card issuer transferred the\ndebt. Accordingly, including both debts improperly inflates the number and total amount\nof debt, which should be seven debts totaling $280,851. \nApplicant has worked as a truck driver, and in associated jobs, for many years. In\n1987, he and his wife also opened a printing business that was fairly successful. In July\n2000, they sold that business to her sister on a loan contract that was meant to provide\nthem with a retirement income stream. She ran the business into the ground and, by\n2003, had sold all the equipment and obtained a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Some\nof the balances on some of the delinquent credit card debt resulted from Applicant and\nhis wife letting her sister charge expenses to their accounts before the business failed,\nbut they do not know how much or which cards were involved. (Answer, Tr. at 35, 39-\n41, 92-94.) \nApplicant inherited his grandparents\u2019 farm in a rural area of the Midwest. In 2001,\nan acquaintance who worked in real estate convinced him and a neighbor that they\nshould dam the creek between their properties to form a small lake, and subdivide their\n\n3\nadjacent properties into ready-to-build lots for sale. He encountered significant\nregulatory problems and other unanticipated expenses, combined with disappointing\nsales performance of the lots. Finally, in 2004, he turned all of his ownership interests\nand associated debt over to another real estate manager, who he had hired to assist\nhim, in return for one dollar. (Answer; Tr. at 38-39, 60-61, 65-72.) \nIn January 2003, Applicant and his wife traded in a fifth-wheel trailer rig in which\nthey had been living for a motor home they purchased for about $200,000. They\nintended to retire and travel while living in the motor home, and wanting ultimately to\nmove to another state. In August, 2004, after the failures of both the printing business\nand land development scheme, they drove the motor home to the other state and\nsought work. He finally obtained his present employment in April 2006. They found living\nin the motor home  to be extremely expensive and often inconvenient, particularly in the\nwinter months. They missed a monthly payment on the motor home loan in April 2006,\nand the lender refused to enter into a modified payment plan. Instead, they were\nthreatened with eviction and repossession. In early 2007, they emptied the motor home,\nput it in a rented storage facility, and moved into an apartment. Since then, they have\nbeen able to meet their present debt obligations, but unable to save any money or\naddress their delinquent debt. Although Applicant now earns about $60,000 per year\nand his wife has worked as much as she could, they have barely been able to keep up\nwith living costs. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law became ill and ultimately passed away in early\n2008, necessitating several expensive trips back to the Midwest. Applicant also suffered\na two-month period of reduced employment during early 2008 due to a medical\nproblem, most of the cost of which was covered by his medical insurance. (Answer; GE\n2 at 15; Tr. at 54-58, 75-76, 83-91, 103-105.)\nAlthough not listed in the SOR, Applicant now has a recently charged-off\nadditional credit card delinquency on a Discover card in the amount of $16,512. This\naccount was reported 30 days past due on his August 16, 2007 credit report, and had\npreviously been 30 days past due in November 2006. (GE 3 at 10; GE 4 at 9.) The\naccount was reported as closed by credit grantor in January and April 2008, and as a\ncharged-off debt in May 2008. (GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 2; GE 8 at 2.)\nApplicant and his wife obtained the required bankruptcy credit counseling in late\nMarch 2008, and met with a bankruptcy attorney on April 1, 2008. The attorney testified\nduring the hearing that she had advised them concerning their options, and that they\nwould probably qualify only for Chapter 13 relief, requiring a five-year partial repayment\nprogram. She did not know when she would be ready to file the action, as they had yet\nto provide her with complete information. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that the reason they\nhad not yet filed for bankruptcy was that they could not afford the attorney fees required\nto be paid before the action could be filed. After some discussion, Applicant and his wife\ndecided to seek additional time before the record closed so they could move forward\nwith the bankruptcy and provide proof thereof. They were granted a month to do so. At\nthe end of that period, they submitted AE D, a letter from the attorney saying she would\nbe filing some type of  bankruptcy petition on their behalf within ten days, and would\nprovide a copy of the court generated transaction report verifying that she had done so.\n\n4\nNeither she, nor Applicant, provided any further proof of progress in connection with\nbankruptcy proceedings. (Answer; Tr. at 74-82, 86-87, 109-111; AE D.)\nApplicant submitted two character-reference letters from former supervisors\nattesting to his reliability, dependability, trustworthiness, and good work performance.\n(AE A at 4, 5.) He also offered numerous certificates and publications documenting his\nsuccessful performance in several demanding and responsible positions. (AE A, first\nsection; AE B; AE C.) He testified credibly that he would resolve his delinquent debts if\nhe had the resources to do so, but saw no way to do so given his present financial\nsituation. (Tr. at 41-42.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\n\n5\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat three were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 97.): \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nThe evidence shows that Applicant, during the three years preceding his security\nclearance application, incurred at least seven SOR-listed delinquent debts totaling in\nexcess of $280,000. His monthly net income is barely sufficient to pay his reported\nregular living expenses and other debts, which did not include any delinquent debt\nrepayments. Substantial security concerns are raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and\n19(c). There is no evidence that these debts were incurred for frivolous or irresponsible\npurchases, so no security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(b) are supported by this record. \n\n6\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from\nfinancial considerations. The four potentially pertinent mitigating conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose over the last five years, and more than\n$280,000 in SOR-listed debts remain delinquent at present. His family budget is such\nthat he does not have the means to repay them, and is likely to incur additional\ndelinquent debt, as has already been demonstrated by another credit card delinquency\nexceeding $16,000 on which he defaulted more than a year after obtaining his present\nemployment. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt could be directly tied to his failed land\ndevelopment project or the failure of his former printing business, although both issues\nresulted in drastically reduced income for the family from what they had hoped to earn.\nEach of these ventures was voluntarily undertaken by Applicant and his wife, and none\nof his delinquent debt involves medical bills. These are not circumstances that can be\nconsidered beyond his control. \nApplicant offered no evidence that he followed the minimal financial counseling\nhe recently sought.  Nor, despite being granted another month in which to do so, did he\nshow that he has followed through on using bankruptcy relief to address his debts. He\nhas not contacted any of his creditors to arrange repayments. There is no indication in\nthis record that his financial issues are either under control or likely to improve in the\nforeseeable future.\nThis evidence establishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (d).\nApplicant remains financially over-extended to a significant extent. He is well regarded\nat work, but that is insufficient to overcome other record evidence concerning his\nfinancial history and present circumstances, as they bear on his trustworthiness,\nreliability and good judgment. \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern includes substantial delinquent debts that he cannot afford to repay. Applicant\nis a mature, experienced adult who is accountable for his decisions and conduct even\nthough he was apparently taken advantage of in several failed business ventures. His\ndebts arose over the past five years, and persist to date. There is ongoing potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation or duress since he remains financially overextended. \nApplicant\u2019s good reputation and performance at work is commendable, but\ninsufficient in itself to mitigate security concerns arising from his financial irresponsibility\nand excessive debt load. His indebtedness is quite likely to continue in the foreseeable\nfuture. His recent efforts to seek resolution of these debts through bankruptcy are steps\nin the right direction, but he has not followed through on that program. He needs\nadditional time to establish a pattern of responsibility, in light of his substantial\nindebtedness and apparently continuing financial over-extension.\nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate reliability and\ntrustworthiness security concerns arising from his inability to satisfy debts, and history of\nnot meeting financial obligations. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his\nfinancial considerations. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He considers himself a Palestinian Christian, and acquired his Israeli citizenship because he was born and lived within Israel when it became a state. He completed two years of college in Israel (1968-1970) where he learned construction. After college, he worked in construction for a number of years. He was then hired by the Israeli government as a driver for the British ambassador to Israel, and worked that post for two years. He believes that while in that job he possessed some type of an Israeli security clearance (Tr. 125).

He \nmitigated the personal conduct security concern. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on September 28, 2006. On May 28 and August 28,2 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), \n \n1  The name of the personal representative was omitted from the decision for security and privacy \nreasons. \n \n2  Amendment to the Statement of Reasons. \n \nMarch 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).3 The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 24 and September 28, 2008, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 24, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 26, 2008, \nscheduling a hearing on December 17, 2008.  \n \nAt the hearing, the government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. GEs 1 through \n3, were admitted without objection (Tr. 23). GE 4 is a government motion for me to take \nadministrative notice of facts regarding Israel and the Palestinian territories.4 Applicant \nobjected to the accuracy of some of the motion\u2019s proffered facts, but not to me taking \nadministrative notice or considering the attached documents (Tr. 23-25). His objection \nwas sustained. I took administrative notice of facts I personally considered relevant and \nmaterial to this case. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented three \nwitnesses and no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 29, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nOn August 28, 2008, the government moved to amend the May 28, 2008 SOR. \nThe amendment to the SOR deleted all subparagraphs under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2. It added \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f to SOR \u00b6 1, and \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.k to SOR \u00b6 2. It also added SOR \u00b6 \n3, with three allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  \n \n \nAt the hearing, the government moved to correct the following typographical \nerrors in its motion to amend the SOR: in the section entitled \u201cGuideline B,\u201d paragraph \n1), first line, \u201c1.a\u201d was changed to read \u201c2.a,\u201d twice. In the same section, paragraph 2), \nfirst line, \u201c1.b\u201d was changed to read \u201c2.b,\u201d twice. \n \n \nApplicant did not object to the amendments to the SOR, or to the correction of \nthe typographical errors. I granted both motions as requested (Tr. 13-14). \n \n \n3  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n4  GE 4 was marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in amended SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2 \n(hereinafter \u201cSOR,\u201d except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.c, which he denied. He denied SOR \u00b6 \n2.a because his son is temporarily living in East Jerusalem (Palestinian occupied \nterritory), not in Israel. He denied SOR \u00b6 2.c because his daughter is a citizen of \nCanada, and a legal U.S. resident. He admitted SOR \u00b6 3.c. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and \n3.b. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review \nof all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old senior maintenance engineer working for a defense \ncontractor. He was born, raised, and educated in Israel (GE 1, Tr. 169). He considers \nhimself a Palestinian Christian, and acquired his Israeli citizenship because he was born \nand lived within Israel when it became a state. He completed two years of college in \nIsrael (1968-1970) where he learned construction. After college, he worked in \nconstruction for a number of years. He was then hired by the Israeli government as a \ndriver for the British ambassador to Israel, and worked that post for two years. He \nbelieves that while in that job he possessed some type of an Israeli security clearance \n(Tr. 125). He never served in the Israeli army or otherwise worked for the Israeli \ngovernment because of his heritage as a Palestinian Christian. \n \nApplicant met his Jordanian born wife in Israel (Tr. 140). She is a distant relative, \nwho came to Israel during the war and was educated in Israel. They were married in \n1973. Their two sons (G) and (R) were born in Israel. In 1978, at age 32, Applicant \nimmigrated with his family to Canada seeking better opportunities for his children and to \navoid the ongoing hostilities between Israel and Muslim states (Tr. 119-120). Applicant\u2019s \nparents had immigrated to Canada around 1973, and he followed them. Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter was born in Canada.  \n \nApplicant became a Canadian citizen in early 1981 and received a Canadian \npassport shortly thereafter. He used his Canadian passport to travel to France in 2000, \nJordan, and numerous times to Israel. Applicant\u2019s Canadian passport expired in 2003, \nand he does not intend to renew it (Tr. GE 3). While in Canada, he worked in \nconstruction and building maintenance. He also worked approximately 10 years for a \nCanadian airline (Tr. 181). He voted two or three times in Canadian elections (Tr. 135). \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in December 1981, because of the better \nworking and living opportunities. He moved to the United States alone to work with his \nbrother-in-law, while his family remained in Canada. He used to own two \nconstruction/management companies, one in Canada and one in the United States (Tr. \n121). He would spend the work week in the United States and travel during the \nweekends to visit with his family in Canada. \n \nIn 1990, Applicant and his wife purchased a home in Canada. He considered that \nhome his residence and lived in it until 2002, when he separated from his wife and \nmoved back to the United States. He divorced his wife in 2006 (Tr. 29). As part of the \ndivorce settlement, Applicant sold his interest in the marital home to his oldest son (G). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHowever, his name will remain in the property title until the mortgage is paid off in \nAugust 2009 and the property is formally transferred to his ex-wife and G. In 2007, he \nused the proceeds from the sale of his interest in the Canadian home to buy a home in \nthe United States with his younger son (R) (Tr. 29, 58). Applicant owns no property, \nbusiness, or any financial interests outside of the United States (Tr. 30).  \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1999. His ex-wife is a Jordanian \ncitizen and naturalized Canadian citizen residing in Canada. He testified she is also a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, but it is not clear when she was naturalized. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife \nhas numerous extended family members who are citizens and residents of Jordan. \nBefore his divorce, Applicant had infrequent contact with his wife\u2019s relatives and \ntravelled to Jordan to visit her relatives. After 2002, when he separated from his wife, \nApplicant has maintained infrequent contact with her relatives in Jordan. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sons, G and R, were born in Israel, and immigrated to Canada with \nhis parents. They grew up, were educated in Canada, and became Canadian citizens. \nG became a Canadian citizen in 1981-1982, and has a valid Canadian passport (Tr. \n35). He also has a valid Israeli passport. He resided in the United States for two years \nwhile attending a prominent U.S. law school where he received a master\u2019s degree in \ninternational law (Tr. 32, 56). After receiving his degree, G returned to Canada and \nworked four years for a commercial law firm and one year as a private practitioner (Tr. \n56).  \n \nG became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003, and has a valid U.S. passport (Tr. \n35). He testified he holds American values and considers himself a U.S. citizen (Tr. 31). \nThe longest period of time he has lived in the United States is two years. However, \nwhile growing up he travelled frequently to the United States during vacations and \nholidays and stayed for weeks at a time with relatives living in the United States (Tr. 58).  \n \nIn 2007, G was hired by an European organization to provide legal advice to the \nPalestinian leadership responsible for certain peace negotiations with Israel (Tr. 38). In \nthis capacity, G interacts, represents and provides advice to the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization (PLO) and its leadership, including the Chairman of the PLO (Tr. 39). He \nhas access to PLO classified information (Tr. 51). He denied any known contact with \nHAMMAS or its members (Tr. 42). Since 2007, he has been residing in the Palestinian \noccupied territory.  \n \nG believes he is part of a close-knit family. He calls and has contact with \nApplicant at least twice a week (Tr. 63). G visits his extended family members living in \nIsrael on a monthly basis. He has close daily contact and friendship with Palestinians \nwho work for the Palestinian authority (Tr.52-53).  His employment contract will expire in \n2009, at which time he intends to move permanently to the United States (Tr. 28). G \nuses any of his three passports to travel abroad for personal or business reasons based \non convenience and expediency (Tr. 33-35). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger son, \u201cR,\u201d has a valid Canadian passport. He also has an \nexpired Israeli passport which he does not intend to renew (Tr. 89). He attended college \nin the United States and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2000 (Tr. 88). He joined \nhis father in the United States because of the better economic opportunities and his \npreference for the American culture. He has a general contracting business in the \nUnited States and travels to Canada frequently to visit his mother and other relatives.  \n \nR\u2019s younger sister lives with him in the United States. She is a legal U.S. resident \nand is applying for U.S. citizenship. R is in the process of organizing his family\u2019s third \nfamily reunion, which is held every four years. His father and mother have \napproximately 150 family members living in the United States and Canada, including his \nmother\u2019s parents and his father\u2019s mother. He testified the number of family members \nresiding in the United States and Canada by far outweighs the number of their relatives \nliving in Israel and the Palestinian occupied territory. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 86-year-old mother and his four siblings are dual citizens of Israel and \nCanada, and reside in Canada (Tr. 144-147). His mother receives a pension from the \nCanadian government. Applicant has telephone contact with his mother and siblings \napproximately three times a week. He travels to Canada to visit his relatives twice a \nmonth. \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law (Z) (ex-wife\u2019s brother) was born in Jordan and \nimmigrated to the United States in 1972 (Tr. 75). He is a successful entrepreneur and \nowns a real state company as well as a construction and facility management company \nin the United States (Tr. 68-69). His construction company specializes in the \nconstruction of secured facilities for government agencies (Tr. 68).  \n \nApplicant has worked for Z since the mid-1990s in construction work and \nmanaging facilities both as an employee and as an independent contractor. From 2002 \nto 2006, he was the senior engineer and facility manager in charge of all the building \nsystems, including the security system, for the building Applicant currently manages. \nWhen the building was turned over to the government contractor, Applicant was hired \nby the government contractor to remain in the position of senior engineer. He has been \ndoing the same job, initially for his brother-in-law, and now the government contractor, \nduring the last five years without any security problems or concerns (Tr. 109). \n \nApplicant was described as honest, completely trustworthy, and as a person with \nhigh integrity and judgment. His brother-in-law assessed him as conscientious, and \nresponsible. He is highly respected for his knowledge and job performance (Tr. 71-71). \n \nAs of the time of his hearing, Applicant possessed a valid Israeli passport that he \nrenewed in 2003, and will not expire until 2013 (Tr. 138, GE 2). He renewed and used \nhis Israeli passport for personal convenience (Tr. 134). He pays less tax when visiting \nIsrael, and does not have to wait in long lines at the airport. Applicant travelled to Israel \nsix times since August 2000, for family related matters, i.e., funerals and to visit family \nand friends (Tr. 132). He travelled to Israel using his Israeli passport three times since \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2003. He travelled to Jordan in 2003 using his Israeli passport. Applicant has a valid \nU.S. passport that he renewed in 1999 and will not expire until March 2009.  \n \nApplicant testified he has no intention to renew his Israeli passport (GE 3). He is \na proud American, loves the United States, and only wants to be a U.S. citizen (Tr. 104-\n105). He loves his job and it is important for him to possess a security clearance to \nretain his job. In his March 2008 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated his \nwillingness to surrender his Canadian and Israeli passports (GE 3). At that time, he \nasked for guidance on how to surrender his Israeli passport. At his hearing, Applicant \nexpressed his willingness to surrender his Canadian and Israeli citizenships (Tr. 104-\n105). Applicant testified all his immediate family members reside in the United States or \nCanada. He has telephone contact with his extended family member residing in Israel \nonce or twice a month or when he travels to Israel approximately once every two years \n(Tr. 146). \n \nThe government alleged Applicant falsified his 2006 e-QIP because he failed to \ndisclose in his answer to question 8.d.1, that he was a citizen of Israel. Applicant \ndisclosed in his answer to the question that he was a citizen of Canada, but failed to \ndisclose he is an Israeli citizen. The e-QIP also shows Applicant disclosed he was born \nin Israel (e-QIP, question 1), that he had foreign connections and contacts with Israel, \nand that he had an active Israeli passport (e-QIP, question 17).  \n \nThe government also alleged Applicant falsified his 2006 e-QIP because he \nfailed to disclose in his answer to question 17.d, that he had an active Canadian \npassport. In his answer to the question, Applicant disclosed that he had an active Israeli \npassport, but failed to disclose his Canadian passport. Applicant disclosed in his e-QIP \nthat he was a dual citizen of the United States and Canada that he owned property in \nCanada, and the periods during which he resided in Canada. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s \nCanadian passport expired on July 24, 2003, prior to him filling out his e-QIP (GE 3). \n \nThe government further alleged Applicant falsified his 2006 e-QIP because he \nfailed to disclose in his answer to question 18, that he had traveled to Israel and \nCanada in multiple occasions. Applicant disclosed that he travelled to Jordan and Israel \nin 2004, but failed to disclose he travelled to Canada once or twice every month to visit \nhis family, and that he travelled to Israel six times after 2000, including three trips since \n2004. \n \nApplicant admitted he failed to disclose the number of times he travelled to \nCanada and Israel, but credibly explained he misunderstood the question, and that his \nomissions were an innocent mistake. Considering the record evidence as a whole (the \ne-QIP, his answer to the DOHA interrogatories, and his demeanor and testimony), I find \nApplicant\u2019s omission were not made with the intent to mislead the government or falsify \nhis security clearance application. He disclosed almost all the information requested in \nhis answers to other e-QIP questions. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The government of Israel is a \nparliamentary democracy. The Israeli government generally respects the human rights \nof its citizens, but there are some issues with respect to treatment of Palestinian \ndetainees, conditions in some detention and interrogation facilities, and discrimination \nagainst Israel\u2019s Arab citizens. Since 1948, the United States and Israel have developed \na close friendship based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security \ninterests. Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced economy and the United \nStates is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner. Since 1976, Israel has been the largest \nrecipient of U.S. foreign aid. The two countries also have very close security relations.   \n \n \nU.S. - Israeli bilateral relations are multidimensional and complex. Israel has \ngiven a high priority to gaining wide acceptance as a sovereign state and to ending \nhostilities with Arab forces. Israel and the United States participate in joint military \nplanning and combined exercises, and have collaborated on military research and \nweapons development. Commitment to Israel\u2019s security and well being has been a \ncornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948, and the two \ncountries are bound closely by historic and cultural ties as well as mutual interests. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, there are several issues of concern regarding U.S. relations \nwith Israel. These include Israel\u2019s military sales to China, inadequate Israeli protection \nof U.S. intellectual property, and espionage-related cases. There are several cases of \nU.S. citizens convicted of selling, or attempting to sell, classified documents to Israeli \nEmbassy officials, as well as cases of Israeli nationals indicted for espionage.   \n \n \nIsrael is one of the most active collectors of proprietary information. Israeli \nmilitary officers have been implicated in this type of technology collection in the United \nStates. There have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, \nof U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Israel. \n \n \nThe theft of sensitive and proprietary information threatens U.S. national security \nin both military and economic terms, and it reveals the intelligence-gathering capabilities \nof foreign governments and foreign companies. Industrial espionage is intelligence-\ngathering \u201cconducted by a foreign government or by a foreign company with direct \nassistance of a foreign government against a private U.S. company for the purpose of \nobtaining commercial secrets.\u201d Industrial espionage is not limited to targeting \ncommercial secrets of a merely civilian nature, but rather can include the targeting of \ncommercial secrets that have military applications, sensitive technology that can be \nused to harm the United States and its allies, and classified information.  \n \n \nI also take administrative notice of the following facts. Palestine is a territory, \ncreated following World War I, as a result of a British mandate. The territory included \nland that is within the current borders of Israel, Jordan, the West Bank and the Gaza \nstrip. In 1948, the British withdrew from the Palestinian territory and Jews proclaimed an \nindependent State of Israel. Escalating violence forced Arabs living in the Palestinian \nterritory to move to the Egyptian controlled Gaza Strip, the Jordanian ruled West Bank, \nJordan, Syria, and Lebanon.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                     \n \nIn the January 2006 Palestinian legislative election, an opposition political party, \nHamas, formed a government without Fatah, the former ruling party within Palestine \nand the largest faction within the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Hamas \ncombines Palestinian nationalism with Islamic fundamentalism. The group is committed \nto the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in all of historic \nPalestine. It has waged an intermittent terrorist campaign to undermine the peace \nprocess and has carried out hundred of terrorist attacks since 1993. The United States \nhas designated Hamas and six other Palestinian groups as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations.  \n \n \nIn February 2007, Hamas and Fatah signed an agreement to form a national \nunity government. However, in June 2007, factional fighting broke out and Hamas took \ncomplete control of the Gaza strip. Fatah retained control over the West Bank. There \nare approximately 60,000 Palestinian Christians living in the occupied territories, about \n2% of the population. Palestinian Christians once made up to some 8-10% if the \nPalestinian Arabs, but their numbers have been shrinking as a disproportionate number \nof them have fled for economic or security reasons. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5  \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d6 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n5  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n6  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) Applicant may be disqualified for the \u201cexercise of any right, \nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the \nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession \nof a current foreign passport; (3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social \nwelfare, or other such benefits;\u201d and (4) voting in a foreign election.  \n \nApplicant renewed and used his Israeli passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. As \nof the day of his hearing, he possessed a valid Israeli passport that will not expire until \n2013. He and his family members accepted educational, medical, retirement, social \nwelfare, and or similar benefits from the Canadian government, and he voted in \nCanadian elections after becoming a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1), (3), and (4) apply. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security concerns arose, in part, out of the exercise of his dual \ncitizenships with Israeli and Canadian citizenships. In March 2008, Applicant stated he \nwas willing to surrender his Israeli and Canadian passports. At his hearing, Applicant \nexpressed a willingness to renounce his dual citizenships with Canada and Israel. \nApplicant has travelled to Israel six times since 2000, including three times after 2003 to \nvisit family members in Israel. In all his travels to Israel, he either used his Canadian or \nIsraeli passport in preference to his U.S. passport. As of his hearing day, Applicant \nenjoyed all the privileges and rights of Israeli citizens, including the possession of a \nvalid Israeli passport in preference of his U.S. passport. AG \u00b6 11(a) does not apply. \n \n \nThe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s possession and use of his Canadian \npassport are diminished because the passport expired and Applicant has no intention to \nrenew it. Applicant and his family received Canadian government benefits after he \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen (i.e., he voted in Canadian elections, his children \nattended Canadian schools, he owned property and interest in a business). Applicant\u2019s \nactions showed he exercised his Canadian citizenship and preference for Canada.  \n \n \nApplicant moved to the United States in 2002, after separating from his wife. He \nsold his interest in the marital home to his older son and purchased his own home in the \nUnited States with his younger son. He has made the United States his home. His \nyounger son and daughter live in the United States, and his older son intends to \nestablish himself in the United States after he completes his employment contract \nabroad. Applicant intends to retire in the United States and his financial and economic \n\n \n11 \n \n \nties are in the United States. Applicant\u2019s behavior since 2002 mitigates the security \nconcerns raised by his past exercise of his Canadian citizenship. His actions no longer \nindicate a preference for Canada over the United States. These facts warrant partial \napplication of foreign preference mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and 11(e). AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n11(a), 11(c), and 11(d) are not applicable.  \n \n \nNotwithstanding, he failed to mitigate the foreign preference security concerns \nraised by his exercise of his Israeli citizenship after he became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. He failed to surrender his Israeli passport and has not mitigated the passport \nspecific issues.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign own or foreign operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                     \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.7 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his older son, who is an Israeli citizen (as \nwell as a Canadian and U.S. citizen), residing in the Palestinian occupied territory. The \ncloseness of the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s frequent telephone, e-mail, and \npersonal contacts with his son, and the fact that his son travelled back to the United \nStates to assist his father during the hearing.  \n \nThis contact creates a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because \nthere is always the possibility that Israeli or Palestinian agents and terrorists operating \nin Palestine may exploit the opportunity to obtain sensitive or classified U.S. information. \nIsrael is one of the most active collectors of sensitive and proprietary information from \nthe United States. Israeli military officers have been implicated in the collection in the \nUnited States of classified and proprietary technology. There have been cases involving \nthe illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to \nIsrael.  \n \nHamas and five other designated terrorist organizations operate within the \nPalestinian occupied territory, and Hamas controls part of the territory. This creates a \ndangerous situation for all American and American interests within the territory. \nApplicant\u2019s son living and working in the Palestinian occupied territory creates a \npotential conflict of interest because his relationship is sufficiently close to raise a \nsecurity concern about Applicant\u2019s desire to help his son by providing sensitive or \nclassified information.  \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife own a home in Canada, which is valued at \napproximately $410,000.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nSix Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \n \n7  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U. \nS.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply and do not mitigate the security concerns \nraised. Appellant did not establish it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of his son and the interests of the U.S. His frequent \ncontact and close relationship with his son could potentially force him to choose \nbetween the United States, Israel, and the Palestinian interests.  \n \nConsidering Israel\u2019s aggressive posture in the collection of sensitive and \nproprietary information in the United States, Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his son \ncreates a higher risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the \nIsraeli government.  \n \nThe nature of the political situation in the Palestinian occupied territory and the \nrelationship of the Palestinian authority with the United States are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that Applicant\u2019s son is vulnerable to government or terrorist coercion. The \nrisk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has \nan authoritarian government, or the government (in this case, the controlling Palestinian \norganization) has interests inimical to the United States.  \n \nHamas and five over terrorist designated organizations operate freely within the \nPalestinian territory, and the Palestinian authority has no control over certain areas of \nthe territory. These circumstances raise the burden of persuasion on Applicant to \n\n \n14 \n \n \ndemonstrate that his son living and working in that area does not pose a security risk \nand that Applicant will not be placed into a position of being forced to choose between \nloyalty to the United States and his family members.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient \nrelationship and loyalty to the United States and should be given credit for his \nconnections to the United States. He has lived in the United States of and off for \napproximately 28 years. He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for around 10 years. His \nsons are U.S. citizens and his daughter is applying for U.S. citizenship. Both his \nyounger son and daughter live in the United States. He has worked hard and is \nsuccessful in his trade. However, when his favorable information is balanced against his \ncontact with his older son, there remains a potential conflict of interest. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) does not mitigate the security concerns raised because Applicant has \nsignificant contacts with his son who is a resident of the Palestinian occupied territory \nand a citizen of Israel. Such contact creates a risk of foreign exploitation because of the \nIsraeli government\u2019s active collection of sensitive U.S. economic, industrial, and \nproprietary information. He also has significant contacts to Israel. Moreover, there is a \nhigher risk is created by Hamas and other terrorist organization operating in the \nPalestinian occupied territory. \n \nAvailable information sustains a conclusion that there is a risk that the Israeli \ngovernment, or terrorist within the Palestinian occupied territory may attempt to exploit \nApplicant directly, or by exploiting Applicant\u2019s son. Applicant\u2019s situation creates a \npotential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligations to protect sensitive \ninformation and his desire/obligation to help himself, or his family were they under \nexploitation by a foreign interest. \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s extensive contacts with his immediate and extended \nfamily members who are citizens and residents of Canada, and some of them who are \ncitizens of Canada but U.S. residents. I also considered that Applicant is still in the title \nof the marital home he purchased with his ex-wife, that his passport expired and he \ndoes not intend to renew it, and his expressed willingness to surrender his Canadian \ncitizenship. Applicant credibly testified that 50% of the interest in the marital home was \nawarded to his wife as a result of their divorce. He sold his 50% interest in the property \nto his older son. A new property title excluding Applicant will be issued when the \nmortgage is paid off in 2009. He has no other property of financial interests in Canada.  \n \nIn light of Canada\u2019s democratic form of government, its stable political situation, \nand the historically strong friendly relationship between Canada and the United States, \nit is not likely that Applicant or his family will be targeted by the Canadian government to \nobtain U.S. protected information. Applicant mitigated the Canada foreign preference \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n\n \n15 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 15.  \n \nApplicant omitted in his answers to his security clearance application that he was \na citizen of Israel, that he had an active Canadian passport, and that he had traveled to \nIsrael and Canada in multiple occasions. He failed to provide information that was \nmaterial to making an informed security decision. Notwithstanding, I find Applicant\u2019s \nomissions were not deliberate or with the intent to mislead the government.  \n \nThe e-QIP shows Applicant disclosed he was born in Israel, that he had foreign \nconnections and contacts with Israel, and that he had an active Israeli passport. \nApplicant also disclosed he was a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, that he \nowned property in Canada, and that he resided in Canada for many years. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s Canadian passport expired on July 24, 2003, prior to him filling out his e-\nQIP, and there is no evidence to show he renewed his Canadian passport.  \n \nApplicant credibly explained he misunderstood the question, and that his \nomissions were an innocent mistake. This is corroborated by his disclosure of almost all \nthe omitted information in other sections of the e-QIP. Considering the record evidence \nas a whole (the e-QIP, his answer to the DOHA interrogatories, and his demeanor and \ntestimony), I find Applicant\u2019s omissions were not deliberate, or made with the intent to \nconceal information, or to falsify his security clearance application. None of the \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n16 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nOn balance, Applicant\u2019s favorable information is summarized as follows. \nApplicant is a loyal and proud American with an excellent work reputation. He has lived \nin the United States, on and off, for 28 years and has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for \n10 years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to the United States. \nTwo of his children are also naturalized U.S. citizens. His daughter lives in the United \nStates and is in the process of applying for U.S. citizenship. Applicant and his sons \ncredibly testified that they intend to permanently live in the United States. Applicant \nintents to retire in the United States, and all his financial interests, including his job are \nin the United States. He also expressed his intention to surrender his Canadian and \nIsraeli citizenships to avoid any possible conflict of interest. \n \nThere is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could cause potential \nharm to the United States, or that he lacks honesty and integrity. He has the respect \nand trust of his references who recommended him for a security clearance without \nreservations. \n \nOn the other hand, there are circumstances that weigh against Applicant in the \nwhole person analysis: Applicant did not surrender his valid Israeli passport; his \nfrequent use of his Canadian and Israeli passports, in preference of his U.S. passport, \nto travel to Israel; Israel\u2019s aggressive pursuit of sensitive or protected U.S. information; \nhis oldest son living in the Palestinian occupied territories; and Applicant\u2019s significant \ncontacts with Israel and Israeli citizens.  \n \nThese circumstances create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Israeli agents or terrorist in the occupied \nterritory may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s son to obtain information about the United \nStates. \u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns arising from his \npossession of a valid Israeli passport and his relationship and contacts with Israeli \ncitizens and residents. He mitigated the personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n17 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c; \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n   and 1.e and 1.f: \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a;  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n   and 2.g-2.j: \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.f; \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n   and 2.k: \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

When completing various security clearance \napplications, he failed to disclose his full arrest record and history of marijuana usage. \nApplicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n \n \n1\nMarch 31, 2009\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on October 30, 2008, detailing security concerns under \ndrug involvement and personal conduct. \n  \n \nOn October 30, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn December 15, 2008, I was assigned the case. On December 17, 2008, DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing which was held on January 8, 2009. \nAt the hearing, the government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 9, which were admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and did not submit any exhibits. On \nJanuary 26, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw the allegation set forth SOR \u00b6 1.g was \ngranted. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the remaining allegations. \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old administative assistant / general clerk who has worked \nfor a defense contractor since November 2002, and is seeking to keep a secret security \nclearance granted in May 2004. Applicant\u2019s supervisor states Applicant is in the top half \nof the eight contractors in his group. Applicant has provided invaluable service by \nrestructuring the operational file system. (Tr. 48) His supervisor, after giving it long \nthrough, stated Applicant deserves a second chance.  \n \n \nIn 2000, Applicant\u2014then age 18\u2014was found guilty of driving a vehicle while \nimpaired by alcohol. (Ex. 2) His Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) was .11. Applicant \npleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation before judgment and required to perform \n24 hours of community service and attend alcohol abuse classes for two hours a week \nfor six weeks. (Ex. 4) \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 2000\u2014when he was in the 10th grade\u2014to May \n2008. His use was once or twice a month and he sometimes went two or three months \nwithout using. (Tr. 35) From October 2004 until June 2008, Applicant worked at his \ncurrent job and smoked marijuana occasionally. (Ex. 9, page 2) He acknowledges \nsmoking marijuana while holding a clearance. (Tr. 28) \n \nIn August 2003 he was charged with possession of controlled dangerous \nsubstance (CDS) paraphernalia. He was in a park was with a group of four people \npassing around a cigarette. At the hearing, Applicant stated marijuana was not involved. \nHe states the group was so poor that each person was unable to smoke their own \nregular cigarettes and had to pass the cigarette back and froth between them as they \nsmoked it. (Tr. 42) When the police asked the men what they were doing, one said \n\u201csmoking dope\u201d and another stated he had some \u201cweed\u201d in his pocket. (Ex. 3, page 2) \nThe charge was nolle prosequi.  \n \nIn 2004, Applicant obtained a security clearance and continued to use marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s company has a policy prohibiting illegal drug use. (Tr. 31) In March 2005, he \nwas arrested and charged with possession of paraphernalia and possession of \nmarijuana. He was stopped for doing 75 mph in a 55 mph zone. He passed a field \nsobriety test. Applicant told the officer he had smoked marijuana that morning. (Ex. 5, \n \n \n \n2\n\npage 2) A zip lock baggie containing marijuana was found under the passenger seat of \nthe vehicle and a burnt marijuana cigarette in the glove box. (Ex. 5, page 3) The \ncharges were placed on the Stet Docket and he was ordered to complete community \nservice and complete a 12 hours substance abuse program. In March 2006, he \ncompleted the program. (Ex. 5)  \n \n \nOn March 17, 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of a \ncontrolled dangerous substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. Applicant and a \nfriend were sitting in a car parked in a handicap parking space without a handicap \nsticker. The car smelled of marijuana and Applicant stated to the officer that he had \nmarijuana in his pocket. (Ex. 8, pages 3, 5 and Ex. 9, page 2) The possession of CDS \ncharge was nolle prosequi. Applicant pleaded guilty to possession of paraphernalia and \nwas granted probation before judgment with probation for three years.  \n \n \nIn April 2003, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application, Standard \nForm (SF) 86. (Ex 1) He answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24, which asked him if he had every \nbeen charged with or convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs even though \nhe had been found guilty of driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol. He answered \n\u201cno\u201d to question 27, which asked him if from the age of 16 or in the last seven years, he \nhad illegally used any controlled substance to include marijuana.  \n \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).(Ex. 6) In response to question 23, his police record, \nhe listed a 2002 DUI, but not his August 2003 arrest for possession of CDS \nparaphernalia or his 2005 arrest for possession of paraphernalia and marijuana. At the \nhearing, Applicant stated it was an accident that he left out the 2003 arrest and the \nMarch 2005 arrest had skipped his mind when he completed the form. (Tr. 28) In \nresponse to question 24, his use of illegal drugs and drug activity, he listed marijuana \nuse 10 times during July and August, 2000 and not thereafter.  \n \nDuring February and March 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a DoD \ninvestigator, (Ex. 7) Applicant stated he had used marijuana from July 2000 to the \nsummer of 2001, but failed to disclose his full history of marijuana use. He did so \nbecause he was worried about the effect the truth would have on his clearance. (Tr. 32) \nApplicant stated he used marijuana 10 times during the period. (Ex. 7, page 5) Applicant \ntold the investigator he listed August 2000 as his stop date because he used in \ninfrequently after that date. (Ex. 7, page 5) In March 2007, Applicant stated he had no \nintention of using illegal substances in the future.  \n \n \nApplicant last used marijuana Memorial Day weekend 2008. (Tr. 30) Applicant is \nwilling to submit to random drug screening. In June 2008, he made a decision not to use \nmarijuana again and to disassociate himself from his friends who use. In August or \nSeptember 2008, he was offered marijuana and declined. Applicant acknowledges he \nhas made bad decisions in the past to smoke marijuana while holding a clearance. At \nthe hearing, (Tr. 19-20) he stated, \n \nFalsifying information in reference to my marijuana use was a terrible \ndecision I chose to make because I was scared that it would affect my \n \n \n \n3\n\nclearance process in a negative way but I never considered what would \nhappen if I was to get caught in the act. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n\nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: Use of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and, \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 2000\u2014when he was in the 10th grade\u2014to June \n2008. His use was once or twice a month, although he sometimes went two or three \nmonths without using. From October 2004 until June 2008, Applicant held a clearance \nat his current job and smoked marijuana occasionally. He acknowledges smoking \nmarijuana while holding a clearance. In 2003, Applicant was charged with possession of \nCDS paraphernalia. In 2005, he was charged with possession of paraphernalia and \npossession of marijuana. He told the police officer he had smoked marijuana that day. \nIn 2007, he was arrested for possession of a CDS and possession of drug \nparaphernalia. At the time of arrest, Applicant informed the police officer he had \nmarijuana in his pocket. (Tr. 28) AG \u00b6 25a, 25c, and 25g apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n \n \n5\n\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nApplicant used marijuana when he held a security clearance. He held a \nclearance at the time of his 2005 and 2007 arrest. The 2007 arrest occurred the day \nafter he completed an interview with a DoD investigator about his illegal drug usage. \nThe disqualifying condition of using illegal drugs while holding a clearance makes no \ndistinction between using at work or while off-duty. Illegal drug use is illegal drug use no \nmatter where it occurs. \n  \n None of the mitigating factors apply to Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs. AG \u00b6 26a \ndoes not apply because the behavior did not happen long ago. His last use was less \nthan one year ago. He used it over an eight year period, sometimes using it two or three \ntimes a month. His use was not infrequent. There is no evidence his use occurred under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur or do not cast doubt on the individual's current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26b does not apply because there is no demonstrated intent not to abuse \ndrugs in the future. Applicant states he will not use marijuana in the future; however he \nmade a similar statement during his DoD interview just before his 2007 arrest. He may \nrefrain from marijuana usage in the future, he may not. It is too soon to tell. He states he \nhas disassociated himself from those individuals that still use illegal drugs. The seven \nmonth period of abstinence is not appropriate period of abstinence when balanced \nagainst his use over an eight year period.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26c does not apply because use of prescription drugs was not an issue. AG \n\u00b6 26d does not apply because there was no satisfactory completion of a drug treatment \nprogram.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana after obtaining a security clearance, after completing \nhis 2003 SF 86, after completing his 2006 e-QIP, after three arrests, and after a DoD \n \n \n \n6\n\ninterview about his illegal marijuana usage. Even though he held a clearance, he lacked \nthe knowledge that his illegal use marijuana was inappropriate and incompatible with \nholding a clearance or the fortitude not to use. Either way, he fails to display the \nreliability and trustworthiness necessary to obtain access to our country\u2019s secrets. His \ncontinued marijuana use over an eight year period raises questions about his ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \nUnder the National Defense Authorization Act for the Fiscal Year 2008, Public \nLaw 110-181, codified in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, an unlawful user of marijuana may not be \ngranted a security clearance. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c (b) uses the present tense, making it \napplicable only if the person \u201cis\u201d an unlawful user or \u201cis\u201d an addict. See ISCR Case No. \n03-25009 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005). Based on the evidence, I conclude Applicant is \ndisqualified as an unlawful user of marijuana. He has used it for most of his adult life. \nHe last used it seven months prior to the hearing. I am satisfied Applicant is a present \nuser of marijuana within the meaning of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c. Applicant is disqualified from \nbeing granted a clearance.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d \n \nUnder AG & 16 (a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d and & 16 (b) \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d \n \nApplicant=s false answer on his SF 86, e-QIP, and his response during his DoD \ninterview concerning his history of marijuana use and arrest history tends to show \nquestionable judgment, unreliability, and a lack of trustworthiness. I find && 16 (a) and \n16 (b) apply. \n \nOn his 2003 security clearance application, Applicant deliberately failed to report \nhis driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol arrest in response to question 24 and his \nuse of marijuana in response to question 27. On his 2006 security clearance \napplication, he failed to list two arrests related to illegal drug usage in response to \nquestion 23 and provided false information concerning his marijuana usage in response \nto question 24 by stating he had used marijuana only ten times. In his 2007 DoD \n \n \n \n7\n\ninterviews, he provided false information about his illegal drug usage stating his last use \nwas in the summer of 2001.  \n \nApplicant has offered no credible explanation for his failure to disclose his arrests \nand illegal drug usage on his SF 86, e-QIP, and interview. His assertion that he was not \nbeing deceptive is unpersuasive. Applicant had knowingly used an illegal drug on \nmultiple occasions. Applicant should have been especially attuned to these questions \nbecause of his arrests and his company\u2019s policy against illegal drug usage. I find \nApplicant deliberately falsified his answer on his the security clearance applications and \nduring his DoD interview.  \n \nUnder the Directive, an applicant may mitigate the security concerns arising from \nquestionable personal conduct under certain circumstances. AG \u00b617 provides \nconditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns, including AG \u00b6 17(a): \n\u201cif a person \u201cprovides the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d I find this \nmitigating factor does not apply. Applicant has not met his burden of proving that he \nmade good-faith efforts to correct the omissions in his security clearance application \nand interview, or that his efforts were prompt.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (f) provides mitigation where \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or \nfrom a source of questionable reliability.\u201d Applicant=s wrongful use of marijuana and \narrests are substantiated by his admissions. The information was pertinent to a \ndetermination of his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I find this mitigating factor \ndoes not apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (c) provides mitigation where \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The security clearance applications at \nissue were executed in 2003 and 2006, and his interview occurred in 2007, all of which \nare recent. The available evidence shows Applicant gave false answers on the security \nclearance application, gave false information three years later on another security \nclearance application, and gave false information a year thereafter during his DoD \ninterview. This was not a single, isolated incident. I conclude this potentially mitigating \ncondition does not apply. I also considered carefully the other potentially mitigating \nconditions and conclude they do not apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62 (a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n \n \n \n8\n\n \n \n \n9\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 25 years old and \nsufficiently mature to make prudent decisions when responding to questions about his \nillegal drug history and arrest record. When he completed his security clearance \napplications he was afraid the truth might adversely impact his job. The government \nexpects and demands truthful responses to questions even when those responses \nmight be adverse or detrimental to the individual seeking to obtain a clearance. \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the drug involvement or personal conduct security concern. Applicant did not \nmeet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In \nreaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and \nthat analysis does not support a favorable decision.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-g: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nOn July 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 11, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on September \n18, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 22, 2008. I convened the \nOctober 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing as scheduled on October 8, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf \nbut did not submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on October 16, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding three allegations \nunder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, as follows: \n \n2.a.  Between 1984 and March 1999, you used marijuana, cocaine, \nhashish, and LSD with varying frequency.  \n \n2.b.  Between March 1999 and April 2008, you used marijuana with \nvarying frequency.  \n \n2.c.    You used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance.  \n \nApplicant did not object to the amendment and it was granted. Applicant was \nasked if he desired additional time to address the amendment. He affirmatively waived \nhis right to additional time and stated that he wanted the hearing to proceed that day.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a bachelor \nof science degree in aerospace engineering. Applicant was married from 1995 until his \ndivorce in 2005. He has two children, ages 13 and 12. He and his former wife have joint \ncustody of the children.1  \n \n \nApplicant worked as an aerospace engineer for the U.S. military from 1984 to \n2000. He had a security clearance during his entire employment with the military. The \nbase where he worked closed in 2000, and his position moved to another state under \nthe Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. Applicant and his wife decided not \nto move to the other state. He started working with computers several years earlier and \nthe internet was increasing in popularity. He also admitted that he had \u201cgotten a little bit \ntired of engineering.\u201d He decided to open his own one-man company developing web \nsites.2   \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 34; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 25-28, 37; GE 1, 2. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant tried to make the company work, but it did not have enough business \nand he started running low on money. He worked as a programmer for a company for \nabout three months in 2002, while attempting to maintain the business. By 2003, the \ncompany was generating almost no money. His wife left him in 2003, which further \ndecimated his financial situation. He was left with the children and little income. His \ncompany had some business in 2004 and early 2005, but not enough to sustain it. He \nfinally closed the company in 2005, and moved with the children to the state where his \nfamily lived. He did not have permission from the court to move his children out of state. \nAfter two months he was ordered back to the state that he had left. He and the children \nlived in a motel for about three months because he was unable to rent a house or \napartment. He started working again in 2005, and was able to rent a home. He changed \njobs several times and had additional unemployment until he started work with his \ncurrent employer in about May 2006.3   \n \n \nThe SOR lists seven debts totaling approximately $19,115. Applicant admitted to \nowing all the debts in the SOR. Applicant has spent the last three years attempting to \nget back on his feet. Because of the traumatic effects of being essentially out of work \nand close to being homeless, he stated that until he has banked six months or so of \nsalary to preclude that from happening again, he is \u201cdisinclined to pay [his] creditors.\u201d \nHe indicated that he has about two months saved, or about $3,500. He has not received \nfinancial counseling.4 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), certified as \ntrue on January 10, 2007. Question 24A asked about any illegal drug use during the \nprevious seven years. He listed one use of marijuana in February 2004.5 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) for his background investigation on September 20, 2007. The \ninterview was summarized in a Report of Investigation (ROI). Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts were discussed. There is no indication that his drug use was discussed.6 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), on \nApril 3, 2008. Question 24a asked about any illegal drug use during the previous seven \nyears. Question 24b asked whether he ever used a controlled substance while holding \ncertain positions or while holding a security clearance. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to both \nquestions. He wrote that he used marijuana, cocaine, hashish, and LSD many times \nbetween 1984 and March 1999, and marijuana five to ten times between March 1999 \nand April 2008. Applicant testified that he last used any illegal drugs in February 2004, \nwhen he smoked marijuana. He admitted that he held a security clearance during his \ndrug use from 1984 through 2000. He categorized his drug use on the questionnaire \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 28-31, 35-37; GE 1, 2, 4, 5. \n \n4 Tr. at 31, 48-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 5. \n \n5 GE 2. \n \n6 GE 5. \n \n\n \n4 \n \ninto two periods because March 1999 was when he last used any drug other than \nmarijuana. He continued to sporadically use marijuana. He put April 2008, as the end \ndate of his marijuana use because that is when he submitted the application. He stated \nhe has no intent to use illegal drugs in the future. After considering all the evidence, I \naccept Applicant\u2019s testimony as credible and find that he has not used illegal drugs \nsince 2004.7  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 31, 38-43; GE 1. \n \n\n \n5 \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).  \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant has not made payments on any of the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is not applicable. He attributed his financial problems to the failure of his business, \nunemployment, under-employment, and his separation and divorce. These are \nconditions that were largely beyond his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also \nrequires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has been \nworking consistently for more than two years and he has not made any effort to pay his \ndelinquent debts. His goal to save six months of salary is laudable, but not at the \nexpense of his creditors. There is insufficient information for a finding that he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. There are not clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. He \nhas not made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;   \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and  \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a clearance.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession8 and use are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) \nas disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 25(g) is also applicable because he held a security \nclearance for many years while using illegal drugs.  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana, cocaine, hashish, and LSD many times between 1984 \nand March 1999, while holding a security clearance. He continued to use marijuana \nsporadically until 2004. He has not used illegal drugs in more than four years and stated \nhe does not intend to use any illegal drugs in the future. His abstinence since 2004 has \ndemonstrated his intent not to abuse any drugs in the future. AG \u00b6 26(b) is applicable. \nHe also receives some credit under AG \u00b6 26(a). However, his drug use while holding a \nsecurity clearance is particularly indicative of poor judgment and continues to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n                                                          \n8 Drugs must be possessed in order to be used. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant attempted to start his own \ncompany after his long-time government job was lost to BRAC. The company was \nunsuccessful and he had long periods of little to no income. His finances were further \nexacerbated by his separation and divorce. Applicant has been steadily employed for \nmore than two years and has made no effort to pay his creditors and will not begin to do \nso until he has saved six months salary. He used marijuana, cocaine, hashish, and LSD \nmany times between 1984 and March 1999, and occasionally smoked marijuana until \n2004. His abstinence since 2004, allays many of the security concerns about current \ndrug use, but does little to alleviate the serious concerns about his judgment generated \nby his drug use while holding a security clearance. His finances and judgment remain \nas security concerns. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues and drug use while holding a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 27-year-old aero-mechanical engineer employed by a defense contractor since February 2005. He has not previously held a clearance. Applicant used marijuana for about 10 years between 1997 and May 2007. Most of his marijuana use occurred during his college years (1999-2004), but his marijuana use continued after his graduation in May 2005. It continued after he had been hired by his current employer in February 2005, despite the fact that company policy prohibited all illegal drug use, and Applicant had been required to pass a drug screening as a condition of employment. During his college years, Applicant contributed to the purchase of marijuana at least once. He also experimented with hallucinogenic mushrooms in the late 1990s, tried ketimine in 1999, cocaine in 2000, and LSD and ecstasy in 2001. He was also arrested for marijuana possession in 1999, pled guilty, and was sentenced to perform community service. However, he continued to use marijuana after this arrest. Applicant disclosed this drug history on a clearance application he executed in August 2007 (G.E. 1). He disclosed essentially the same information during a October 2007 subject interview (G.E. 2).

Mendez, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 9 April 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nH.  Applicant answered the SOR 27 May 2008, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 18 July 2008, and I convened a hearing 25 August 2008.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 4 September 2008.\n \nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 27-year-old aero-mechanical\nengineer employed by a defense contractor since February 2005. He has not previously\nheld a clearance.\nApplicant used marijuana for about 10 years between 1997 and May 2007. Most\nof his marijuana use occurred during his college years (1999-2004), but his marijuana\nuse continued after his graduation in May 2005. It continued after he had been hired by\nhis current employer in February 2005, despite the fact that company policy prohibited\nall illegal drug use, and Applicant had been required to pass a drug screening as a\ncondition of employment. During his college years, Applicant contributed to the\npurchase of marijuana at least once. He also experimented with hallucinogenic\nmushrooms in the late 1990s, tried ketimine in 1999, cocaine in 2000, and LSD and\necstasy in 2001. He was also arrested for marijuana possession in 1999, pled guilty,\nand was sentenced to perform community service. However, he continued to use\nmarijuana after this arrest.\nApplicant disclosed this drug history on a clearance application he executed in\nAugust 2007 (G.E. 1). He disclosed essentially the same information during a October\n2007 subject interview (G.E. 2).\nApplicant stopped using marijuana in May 2007, because he knew that the\ngovernment would not allow him to have a clearance if he was using marijuana. Yet, he\nknew that company policy also prohibited drug use, and he knew when he was hired\nthat he would eventually be required to obtain a clearance. He also cites his girlfriend\n(soon-to-be-fianc\u00e9) of 2 \u00bd years as another reason for him to remain drug free. She\ndoes not use marijuana, but is aware that Applicant has.\nAfter graduation from college in May 2005, Applicant used marijuana in party\nsettings when it was offered to him. Since May 2007, he has been offered marijuana by\nacquaintances at two different parties, but asserts\u2014without corroboration\u2014that he has\ndeclined.\nApplicant is a good employee (A.E. A). He has executed a formal drug statement\nof intent as contemplated by the Directive (A.E. B).\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse ; (c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\n3\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\u00b6 26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n4\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b6 26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug\n5\nusing associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\n3\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana between 1999 and May\n2007.  However, Applicant has only partially mitigated the security concerns. Regarding\n3\nhis experimental use of ecstasy, LSD, cocaine, ketimine, and hallucinogenic\nmushrooms, he demonstrated that the use was under circumstances unlikely to recur,4\nand further demonstrated intent to not abuse these drugs in the future.  While\n5\nApplicant\u2019s use of these drugs is fairly characterized as \u201crecent,\u201d this term has less\nmeaning under the new adjudicative criteria, where the corresponding language \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago. . .\u201d [\u00b6 26.(a)], is used in the disjunctive with language\nthat clearly applies to Applicant. In addition, his experimental drug abuse was\ninfrequent.\n\n4\nHowever, Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns over his marijuana\nuse. This use began before college, continued while he was in college, and continued\nlong past the point where he was aware of the potential consequences for his\nemployment and clearance. He continued marijuana use after 1999 despite his\nmarijuana possession. He continued despite company policy and his knowledge that a\nclearance in his position would eventually be required. Unlike his experimental use of\ndrugs, Applicant use of marijuana was recent, not infrequent overall, and not under\nunusual circumstances. He has not dissociated himself from drug using associates and\ncontacts, changed or avoided environments where drugs are used, or had an\nappropriate period of abstinence. Without some corroboration of either his abstention or\nhis refusal of offered marijuana, I do not consider his year-plus abstinence from\nmarijuana use an appropriate period of abstinence. I have considered his signed\nstatement of intent to refrain from marijuana use. However, aside from this statement,\nApplicant offers little in the way of changed circumstances that give credence to his\nnow-stated intent to refrain from marijuana use in the future. Accordingly, I resolve\nGuideline H against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn July 23, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nOn January 19, 2010, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nalleging facts which, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the adjudicative\nDecember 8, 2010\n\n The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.\n2\nPending official revision of the Directive, they take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n2\nguidelines (AG)  for sexual behavior (Guideline D), personal conduct (Guideline E),\n2\ncriminal conduct (Guideline J), and use of information technology systems (Guideline\nM).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on June 21, 2010. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued on June 24,\n2010, I convened a hearing in this matter on July 14, 2010. The parties appeared as\nscheduled. The Government presented nine exhibits (Gx. 1 - 9) and one witness.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and presented one exhibit (Ax. A). Additionally, I\nleft the record open after the hearing to receive from Applicant a post-hearing\nsubmission. The record closed on July 26, 2010, when I received, via Department\nCounsel, Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, which is admitted without objection as\nAx. B. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on July 28, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant was fired from a job\nwith a defense contractor in July 2003 for violating company policy regarding accurate\nsubmission of time cards and expense reports, and for \u201cactions inconsistent with the\nbest interest of the company\u201d (SOR 1.a); that three or four times a year in the three\nyears before about November 2004, Applicant uploaded sexually explicit materials,\nincluding photos of naked 14- or 15-year-old girls, onto his company laptop (SOR 1.b);\nthat in about November 2004, he was fired from his job for the conduct alleged in SOR\n1.b (SOR 1.c); that he had the hard drive on his company laptop erased to remove the\nsexually explicit materials described in SOR 1.b (SOR 1.d); that on August 25, 2004, he\ndeliberately falsified a security clearance application (SF 86) by responding \u201cNo\u201d to\nquestion 20 (Your Employment Record - Has any of the following happened to you in\nthe last 7 years? - Fired from job - Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired - Left a job\nby mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct - Left a job by mutual\nmisconduct following allegations of unsatisfactory performance - Left a job for other\nreason under unfavorable circumstances) and not disclosing that he was fired from his\njob in July 2003 as alleged in SOR 1.a (SOR 1.e); and that he deliberately falsified his\nJuly 23, 2007, e-QIP, by responding \u201cYes\u201d to question 22 (Your Employment Record -\nHas any of the following happened to you in the last 7 years? - Fired from job - Quit a\njob after being told you\u2019d be fired - Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations\nof misconduct - Left a job by mutual misconduct following allegations of unsatisfactory\nperformance - Left a job for other reason under unfavorable circumstances) and\ndisclosing that he was fired from the job referred to in SOR 1.c, but providing a false\nand misleading explanation of why he was fired (SOR 1.f).\nIn response to SOR 1.a, Applicant admitted that he was fired for not submitting\naccurate expense reports; but he denied that he submitted inaccurate time cards or that\nhe did not act in the best interests of the company. He admitted with explanation the\n\n Likely the same as the allowances for military and government civilian personnel travel, which is subject to\n3\nthe Joint Travel Regulations.\n3\nallegations at SOR 1.b - 1.d. As to SOR 1.b, Applicant denied knowing if there were\nsexually explicit pictures of minor females on his laptop. As to SOR 1.e, Applicant\nadmitted that he did not disclose that he was fired in 2003, but denied intentionally\nomitting that information. As to SOR 1.f, Applicant admitted providing a false\nexplanation because he was embarrassed by his behavior that caused him to be fired.\nUnder Guideline M, the Government cross-alleged the conduct described at SOR\n1.b and 1.d. (SOR 2.a) Applicant\u2019s answer to the Guideline E allegations served as his\nresponse to the Guideline M allegations.\nUnder Guideline D, the Government cross-alleged the conduct described at SOR\n1.b and 1.c. (SOR 3.a) Applicant\u2019s answer to the Guideline E allegations served as his\nresponse to the Guideline D allegations.\nUnder Guideline J, the Government cross-alleged the possession of child\npornography described in SOR 1.b as an allegation of criminal conduct (SOR 4.a).\nApplicant referred to his response to SOR 1.b as his response to SOR 4.a. Finally, the\ndeliberate falsifications alleged at SOR 1.e and 1.f were cross-alleged as felony\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (SOR 4.b). Applicant referred to his responses to SOR\n1.e and 1.f as his response to SOR 4.b. Having reviewed Applicant\u2019s response to the\nSOR, the transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 41 years old, and works for a defense contractor as a technician\nperforming communications and data systems installations at military installations in the\nUnited States and abroad. He has held that position since May 2005. Applicant first\nreceived a security clearance in about 1991, when he was hired by another defense\ncontractor (Company A), where he worked as a draftsman and as an installation\ntechnician until July 2003. Thereafter, he worked for another defense contractor\n(Company B) doing similar work until January 2005. After leaving Company B, he was\nself-employed as a cable television installer and as a draftsman before being hired by\nhis current employer. (Gx. 1)\nApplicant and his wife have been married since October 1999. In addition to\nraising her two children (now ages 25 and 23) from a previous marriage, they have two\nchildren (ages 14 and 13) of their own. (Id.) Applicant is a high school graduate with\nabout two years of vocational training towards an associate\u2019s degree. Available\ninformation about his performance at Company A and at his current job shows that he\nhas a positive attitude, is a hard worker, and is highly valued for his teamwork and his\nexpertise. (Ax. A; Ax. B)\nApplicant\u2019s work at Company A required extended periods of temporary duty\n(TDY) travel to military installations. His living expenses were paid by his employer\nbased on travel expense claims filed when he returned. Applicant\u2019s travel expenses\nwere limited to a specified daily allowance  for lodgings, meals, and incidentals. That\n3\n\n4\namount varies depending on geographic location of the employee\u2019s travel. For lodgings,\nApplicant would be reimbursed only for what he actually spent up to the specified daily\nallowance. The daily allowance for meals and incidentals was paid whether or not he\nactually spent that amount. \nFrom September 15, 2002, until October 15, 2002, he and several co-workers\nwere on TDY at a stateside military base for a system installation. Applicant and his co-\nworkers stayed at a hotel geared to long-term stays. Occasionally, reservations are\nbooked through a realty company that brokers availabilities of long-term lodgings such\nas the one at which Applicant stayed. However, in this instance, the hotel Applicant and\nhis co-workers used billed each employee directly, and each employee was responsible\nfor submitting a travel claim for reimbursement to their company. To receive\nreimbursement, Applicant was required to provide a copy of a paid, itemized receipt\nfrom the hotel showing the dates stayed and the rate charged, plus any taxes.\nAt the end of his TDY in October 2002, Applicant submitted a false claim for\nexpenses, whereby he claimed that he paid the full allowance amount for lodgings at\nthat location. In actuality, Applicant paid significantly less, but he intended to keep the\ndifference. To document his claim, Applicant established what can best be described as\na \u201cstrawman\u201d real estate company and opened a business account with a bank. This\nallowed him to obtain a credit card machine to process transactions. He used the credit\ncard machine to produce false receipts that purported to show he paid more than he\nactually did. He also produced an itemized receipt on letterhead of his company to\nsupport the credit card receipt. (Gx. 7 - 9) Applicant claimed that he was simply doing\nwhat other companies had done, but he also acknowledged that he never entered into\nany formal agreement with his employer to broker long-term hotel reservations for its\nemployees. (Tr. 103 - 105) An accounting summary of Applicant\u2019s travel costs and his\nclaim for reimbursement showed that Applicant overcharged Company A by $1,207.26.\n(Gx. 6)\nCompany A management became aware of irregularities in Applicant\u2019s travel\nclaims while Applicant was TDY at an overseas job site. They immediately recalled him\nand terminated his employment. In a meeting with his supervisor (who testified at this\nhearing) and a company human resources representative, Applicant insisted that he be\nallowed to resign, but his superiors did not give him that option. Applicant abruptly left\nthe meeting, and still insists he quit before he was fired. The basis cited for his\ntermination was his violation of company procedures requiring accurate submission of\ntime cards and travel expense reports. Applicant did not file false time cards, but he did\nfile false travel expense reports. Also cited was his failure to act in the best interests of\nthe company. (Gx. 3; Gx. 4; Gx. 5; Tr. 30 - 52)\nApplicant went to work for Company B the same month he was fired by Company\nA. His work at Company B was similar and required him to travel in much the same\nmanner as he had with Company A. While on TDY with Company B, Applicant was\nissued a company-owned laptop computer. He was only supposed to use the laptop for\nofficial business, such as company e-mail and transmittal of weekly time cards.\nHowever, on multiple occasions, Applicant brought the laptop to a friend who loaded\nsexually explicit photographs and other materials onto the computer. After returning\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n5\nfrom his trips, Applicant would bring the computer back to his friend, who erased the\nhard drive. In 2004, before leaving for a TDY assignment, Applicant received more\nsexually explicit materials from his friend in the form of a compact disk (CD). While on\nTDY, Applicant hurt his back and had to be hospitalized for an operation. His laptop was\nreturned to the company in a carrying case along with the CD before Applicant could\nhave the hard drive erased. Applicant\u2019s company discovered the CD and ultimately fired\nhim. Applicant acknowledged that he knew he had misused company property in a way\nthat violated company procedures and policies. (Gx. 2; Tr. 82 - 87, 105 - 110)\nOn July 23, 2007, Applicant submitted an e-QIP (Gx. 1) to renew his clearance.\nHe answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 22. He then listed his dismissals from Company A and\nCompany B. As to the reason for leaving Company A, he indicated that he had quit\ninstead of being fired, and he stated that he had used his personal business credit card\nto pay for his lodgings while on TDY. He also implied that he had done nothing wrong\nand that he disagreed with Company A\u2019s interpretation of what he had done.\nAs to the reason for leaving Company B, Applicant stated only that after he was\nhospitalized for his back injury, he returned home and received a letter notifying him that\nhe was fired. He did not mention any disciplinary action stemming from his use of a\ncompany laptop to store and view sexually explicit material. However, in a signed,\nsworn statement given to a Government investigator on June 17, 2008, and in response\nto the SOR, Applicant admitted that he deliberately falsified the reason for his dismissal\nfrom Company B because he was embarrassed about his conduct. (Gx. 2)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n5\nin the adjudicative guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n6\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 12 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior), AG \u00b6 15 (Guideline\nE - Personal Conduct), AG \u00b6 30 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct), and AG \u00b6 39\n(Guideline M - Use of Information Technology Systems).\nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to\nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a\nsecurity clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who\n6\nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.7\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct \nAll of the information presented, including Applicant\u2019s testimony and admissions\nto the SOR, raises a security concern about his personal conduct that is expressed at\nAG \u00b6 15 as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAs to the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1,d, the Government presented\nsufficient reliable information, including Company A records and the testimony of\nApplicant\u2019s Company A supervisor, that showed he was dismissed from Company A for\nfiling false travel expense reports. Additionally, Applicant admitted to a Government\ninvestigator, and in response to the SOR, that for two and a half years, he repeatedly\nmisused a Company B laptop by loading onto it sexually explicit materials, which he\n\n7\nerased from the computer when he returned from TDY assignments; and that he was\nfired by Company B when it was learned that he was misusing employment; and that he\ntried to hide his misconduct by having the laptop hard drive erased when he returned\nfrom TDY assignments. Applicant has acknowledged knowing, at the time he was\nengaged in this conduct, that it was against company policy. \nAs discussed below, the facts established through these allegations are\nspecifically addressed under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and M (Use of Information\nTechnology Systems), and they are sufficient to disqualify Applicant under either or both\nof those guidelines. Accordingly, I have not applied the Guideline E disqualifying\nconditions at AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue\nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information) and AG \u00b6 16(d)\n(credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and\nmay not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined\nwith all available information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment,  untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive\ncorporate or other government protected information; (2) disruptive, violent, or other\ninappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; (4)\nevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or resources).\nNonetheless, the facts established through SOR 1.a - 1.d invoke the general security\nconcern stated in AG \u00b6 15, above.\nThe Government also presented sufficient reliable information, including\nApplicant\u2019s admission in response to the SOR, to support the allegation at SOR 1.f. He\ndeliberately withheld relevant and material information about why he was fired from his\njob with Company B, because he was embarrassed over what he had done. The facts\nestablished through this allegation require application of the disqualifying condition at\nAG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities). \nHowever, as to the allegation at SOR 1.e, Applicant denied the gravamen of the\nallegation by denying any intent to falsify, thereby keeping the burden on the\nGovernment to prove the allegation. The Government alleged in SOR 1.e that Applicant\nfalsified an SF 86 submitted in August 2004, by failing to disclose that he left Company\nA under adverse circumstances. The SF 86 referred to in the allegation was not\nsubmitted at hearing. Further, in response to the same question in the e-QIP Applicant\n\n8\nsubmitted in 2007, Applicant disclosed his dismissal from Company A under adverse\ncircumstances. Accordingly, SOR 1.e is resolved for Applicant.\nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant did not provide any\ninformation that supports application of the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 17. AG \u00b6\n17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not apply,\nbecause it appears that the first time Applicant disclosed the real reason Company B\nfired him was during an interview with a Government investigator long after he\nsubmitted his e-QIP. \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 17(b) (the refusal or failure to cooperate,\nomission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or\ninadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the\nindividual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual\ncooperated fully and truthfully) does not apply because Applicant did not claim or\nestablish that anyone told him it would be appropriate to lie about why Company B fired\nhim or to withhold information about his use of a company laptop to store sexually\nexplicit materials. Likewise, Applicant has not presented any information that supports\napplication of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress). There\nis no indication that his current employer is aware of his misconduct while employed at\nCompany B.\nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time\nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s\nwillingness to lie to the Government about important information in his background is a\nfundamental breach of the fiduciary relationship Applicant seeks to have with the\nGovernment. As discussed under Guideline J, below, his conduct in this regard is a\nfelony violation of federal criminal law. His willingness to break the law to conceal\nembarrassing behavior cannot be characterized as minor, and it must be considered\nrecent as it is part of his current request for a clearance.\nThe mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps\nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) and\nAG \u00b6 17(f) (association with persons involved in criminal activities has ceased or occurs\nunder circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations) are\ninapposite to the facts and circumstances of this case. Nonetheless, Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns about his personal conduct that arise from the\nGovernment\u2019s information.\n\n9\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Government alleged in SOR 4.a that the information included in the\npornographic materials Applicant loaded onto his Company B computer were\nphotographs of 14- and 15-year-old girls. Applicant admitted having pornographic\nmaterials on his company computer, but he denied that he had pictures of underage\ngirls or that he knew such pictures were among the materials his friend loaded on the\ncomputer or were on the CD. The Government did not provide sufficient information to\nsupport this allegation of criminal conduct, and there is no information that shows law\nenforcement authorities even investigated Applicant for possession of child\npornography. Accordingly, SOR 4.a is resolved for the Applicant. \nHowever, as to the allegation at SOR 4.b, that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1001 by deliberately making false statements to the Government as alleged in SOR 1.e\nand 1.f, the record shows that he knowingly sought to hide the true reason for his\ndismissal from Company B when he answered e-QIP question 22. As already discussed\nunder Guideline E, above, the record does not support SOR 1.e as written.\nNonetheless, there is no question that he intended to conceal information from the\nGovernment as alleged in SOR 1.f. This information is sufficient to raise a security\nconcern about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct that is expressed at AG \u00b6 30 as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nMore specifically, Applicant\u2019s violation of federal criminal law requires application\nof the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).\nI have also considered the potential applicability of the mitigating conditions listed\nunder AG \u00b6 32; however, Applicant did not present any information that supports\napplication of any of those factors. The mitigating condition at AG \u00b632(a) (so much time\nhas elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Just as his falsification is\nconsidered recent under Guideline E, so, too, not enough time has passed, especially in\nlight of his fraudulent conduct while employed by Company A, and his attempts to hide\nhis misconduct from Company B by erasing the laptop hard drive. As to AG \u00b6 32(b) (the\nperson was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no\nlonger present in the person's life) and AG \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did not\ncommit the offense), as discussed under Guideline E, Applicant did not establish that he\nwas advised to omit the truth about his Company B firing, and it cannot be controverted\nthat he committed the offense listed. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nraised by the Government\u2019s information about his criminal conduct.\n\n10\nSexual Behavior\nThe Government presented sufficient information to invoke the security concern\nabout sexual behavior expressed at AG \u00b6 12 as follows:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in the Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \nApplicant admitted using his company laptop to store and view sexually explicit\nmaterials. The record does not support that part of the SOR 3.a allegation that he\npossessed and viewed child pornography, which is a criminal offense in virtually every\njurisdiction in the United States. Thus, there is no criminal aspect to Applicant\u2019s sexual\nbehavior. However, Applicant demonstrated a disregard for company policies by\nmisusing the laptop as he did. He was also embarrassed enough by his conduct to try to\nconceal it from the Government when he applied to renew his security clearance.\nAccordingly, the facts established through SOR 3.a require application of the\ndisqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 13(c) (sexual behavior that causes an individual to be\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress) and AG \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior . . .\nwhich reflects lack of discretion or judgment).\nExamination of the Guideline D mitigating conditions shows that AG \u00b614(a) (the\nbehavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no evidence of\nsubsequent conduct of a similar nature) is not pertinent to the facts and circumstances\nof this case. AG \u00b614(b) (the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or\nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) might apply\ngiven that the conduct occurred six years ago and there is no record of similar conduct\nsince then. But Applicant\u2019s actions in this regard occurred over two and a half years,\nand served as a catalyst for further misconduct in the form of deliberate falsifications\nand attempts to conceal his misuse of company property for sexual purposes. His\nconduct directly undermines confidence in his judgment and trustworthiness. Further,\nAG \u00b6 14 (the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress)\ndoes not apply because Applicant did not present information that would indicate that\nanyone other than his wife knows about his conduct. He was embarrassed enough to\ntry to conceal his conduct from the Government, but he has not shown that his current\nemployer, for example, has been advised that he left Company B under adverse\ncircumstances. Finally, AG \u00b614(d) (the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual,\nand discreet) does not apply because, when Applicant decided to use a company\ncomputer to view sexually explicit materials, his conduct was no longer private or\ndiscreet. On balance, Applicant did not mitigate the security concern about his sexual\nbehavior.\n\n11\nUse of Information Technology Systems\nThe Government established that Applicant\u2019s conduct also requires consideration\nof the security concern expressed at AG 39 as follows:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related  computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nAs alleged in SOR 2.a, Applicant knowingly violated Company B policies when he used\na company-owned laptop to store and view sexually explicit materials. Available\ninformation requires application of the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 40(f) (introduction,\nremoval, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any\ninformation technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules,\nprocedures, guidelines or regulations). He testified that he knew when he was doing it,\nthat using the  laptop as he did was against company policy. \nBy contrast, Applicant did not provide any information that supports application of\nthe mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 41. I have not considered AG \u00b6 41(a) (so\nmuch time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) for the same reasons I did not\napply AG \u00b6 14(b), AG \u00b6 32(a), and AG \u00b6 17(c). Further, there is no support for\napplication of AG \u00b6 41(b) (the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of\norganizational efficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's\npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily available) and AG \u00b6\n41(c) (the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a prompt,\ngood-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor). Applicant\u2019s\nconduct was deliberate and repeated over time. Nothing about it was intended to\nimprove organizational efficiency. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nraised by the Government\u2019s information about his use of information technology\nsystems.\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines D, E, J, and M. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 41\nyears old, and he has worked for his current employer for about five years. His wife\ntestified that he is a responsible father and husband who is generous to a fault. His\ncurrent employer values his expertise and his value as a team player. His current\nemployer also cited the absence of any disciplinary problems or travel expense\nirregularities since he has worked there. Thus, it appears his current employer is aware\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n12\nof some of the adverse information in Applicant\u2019s background. However, there was no\nmention of his Company B dismissal, which tends to show that his embarrassment over\nhis conduct might hinder his candor in the future. Coupled with Applicant\u2019s willingness to\nviolate federal law to conceal his misconduct, and his past attempts to defraud his\nemployer, the positive information about his current circumstances is insufficient to\novercome the negative inferences to be drawn from the Government\u2019s information. \nA fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on\n8\nApplicant\u2019s past conduct and current circumstances shows he has failed to address\nsatisfactorily the Government\u2019s doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the\nGovernment\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\nGovernment.  \n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline M:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a :\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a :\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a :\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security clearance\nis denied.\n                                         \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 9, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process\nbecause Department Counsel acted improperly; whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on substantial\nevidence; whether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had deliberately provided false or\nmisleading information to an investigator; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision under\nGuideline B is sustainable.1\n(1) Applicant contends that he was denied due process because Department Counsel acted\nimproperly.  In support of that contention, he argues that the Department Counsel engaged in an\naggressive cross-examination of his character witness, asking him questions which Applicant had\nnot anticipated him asking.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that federal officials and employees carry out their duties\nin good faith.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001).  A party seeking to\nrebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  Applicant has not met that\nheavy burden in that he fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a\nbasis for a reasonable person to conclude that Department Counsel acted improperly, unfairly or\nunprofessionally.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 06-26704 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2008)(no denial of due\nprocess where Department Counsel \u201csubjected [Applicant] to an aggressive cross-examination which\nelicited adverse details about his alcohol use that went beyond the specific facts recited in the SOR\nand the documentary exhibits, and undermined his credibility with the Judge\u201d); ISCR Case No. 03-\n04927 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005)(no denial of due process where pro se Applicant claimed \u201cshe\nwas no match for the \u2018very serious and prepared professionals\u2019 who represented the government\u201d);\nISCR Case No. 03-21262 at 2-3 (Jul. 10, 2007)(no denial of due process where pro se Applicant\nclaimed that \u201cDepartment Counsel raised his voice . . . and attempted to sway the Judge with\nemotional arguments\u201d).\n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge erred with respect to several of her findings.  The Board does not find this argument\npersuasive.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\n\nDecision at 8.\n2\n3\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n(3) Applicant contends that he did not deliberately provide false or misleading information\nto an investigator, when he stated he had not called or written his siblings in Iraq since he came to\nthe United States in the 1990s.   In support of this contention, he argues that allegation resulted from\na misunderstanding.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge erred.\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that she considered the circumstances surrounding\nthe allegation in light of Applicant\u2019s explanation and the record evidence as a whole, and concluded\nthere was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant had provided false or misleading information:  \nApplicant listed in his security application that he maintained contact\nwith his [siblings] who are residents and citizens of Iraq.  He later\nchanged that information in an interview with an investigator in 2007.\nHe had an opportunity to clarify or correct this information in\ninterrogatories in 2008.  He made certain corrections but did not \nchange the reference to contact with his [siblings].  At the hearing,\nhe was inconsistent with his statements and answers to questions\nby counsel.  I allow for the second language and possible\nmisunderstandings, but I did not find Applicant credible, especially\nin light of his strong desire to maintain employment.2\nGiven the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.\n(4)  Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed based on his\nfavorable character references, his good job performance, and his strong ties to the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments in that regard do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\n\nDecision at 10.\n3\n4\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00434 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 18, 2008).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  She reasonably explained why the evidence which\nthe Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Therefore, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cit is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d3\nis sustainable.

On May 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his\napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 9, 2008; answered it on the\nsame day; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on July 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 16, 2008. I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on August 14, 2008. Government Exhibits (GX) 1\nthrough 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own\nSeptember 9, 2008\n\n2\nbehalf and presented one witness. Applicant submitted Exhibits (A-G), which were\nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August\n25, 2008. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Iraq (Tr. 10). The request and the attached documents are\nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibit I. Hence, the facts administratively noticed are\nlimited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a- and\ndenied the other allegations in the SOR. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at\nthe hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 62-year-old man who was born and educated in Iraq. He graduated\nfrom a college of veterinary medicine and was a practicing veterinarian for many years.\nApplicant was drafted into the Iraqi military and served from 1986 until 1989 (Tr. 60). He\nhas lived in the United States since January 1994 (Tr. 51). He became a naturalized U.S.\nCitizen in June 1999. He has been employed with his current employer since August\n2006 as a translator (linguist) (GE 1). He speaks three languages. Applicant held an\ninterim security clearance (Tr. 54).\nApplicant married his wife in 1976 in Iraq (Tr. 63). She is a naturalized U.S. citizen\nand resides with Applicant in the U.S. They have no children. His father and mother-in-\nlaw are deceased. Applicant\u2019s parents are also deceased (Tr. 68).\nApplicant has three retired sisters who are citizens of Iraq. Two sisters reside in\nIraq and the youngest is now in Jordan. His brother, is a U.S citizen living in the U.S.\nApplicant maintained contact with his sisters once every two months according to the\ninvestigation in August 2006 for his security clearance and the information on his\nSeptember 2006 security application. Applicant\u2019s three sisters who are now retired spend\ntime at home. He believes because they are Christian, they would not be subject to\nkidnapping or terrorism. He believes because they are female they would not be subject\nto a kidnap situation because no one cares about women. He states they are older, ages\n63, 72 and 74 respectively. Two sisters are retired teachers and one is a retired hotel\nworker. They all receive pensions. He believes most kidnapping occurs to people\nbetween the ages of 20 to 50 years of age. (Tr. 30; AE D). He concluded that security is\nnow improved in Iraq. He emphasized that his sisters stay home and that they have no\nrelationships with insurgents. His youngest sister is now in Jordan seeking to immigrate\n(AE D).\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s wife also speaks to his sisters occasionally (Tr. 80). Applicant\u2019s Iraqi\nborn, American citizen, brother-in-law was killed in Iraq after returning to the country (Tr.\n66; GE 2). \nApplicant\u2019s wife has a sister and a brother living in northern Iraq (Tr. 64). Her\nbrother-in-law is retired from the Iraqi Army after 20 years. Applicant\u2019s sister works as a\nnurse in a hospital. Applicant\u2019s wife maintains phone contact with them once a week (Tr.\n68). \nIn April 2007, Applicant spoke to an interviewer concerning his security clearance\napplication. He stated he had not called or written to his three sisters living in Iraq since\nhe came to the U.S. in 1994. He stated that he has no communication with them at all\nbecause he is an American citizen, and contact with him could pose too much risk for\nthem. He claims that this is a misunderstanding with the investigator and a mis-\ncommunication (Tr. 16).\nApplicant acknowledged at the hearing that his three sisters would be in great\ndanger if he had contacted them in 2007. He explained that he did not mean to say that\nhe had not contacted them since he has been in the states. However, he emphasized\nthat the government is kidnapping and killing people and he feared for the safety of his\nsisters. He acknowledged that talking by phone is not safe and that corruption is\neverywhere. He admitted that he talked with his one sister during this time frame (2006)\nbecause she called him (Tr. 98). He also stated he sent some money (approximately\n$500) to be divided among them at some point when he was in the U.S. (Tr. 108). \nAt the hearing, Applicant expounded on all the reasons that his three sisters\nwould not be harmed in Iraq. However, that is not logical considering the fact that he said\nit was too dangerous to talk with them in 2007. Applicant did have some difficulty with the\nspoken language at the hearing. He repeatedly stated that he is not a threat to the U.S.\nHowever, his testimony was inconsistent. At one point, he said he rarely contacted his\nsisters and then when questioned again he said he really did not know when and if he\ncontacted them (Tr. 76). He also said that his wife keeps in touch and then he concluded\nby saying that it is much better now in Iraq and not as dangerous. He stated this his\nsisters knew of his work with the U.S. Army as a translator (Tr. 99).\nIn his 2008 interrogatories, Applicant had an opportunity to correct anything that\nwas not accurate in the 2007 interview. He did correct several items, such as his birth\nyear, and the fact that his sisters have no affiliations with insurgents (GE 2). He did not\ncorrect the statement pertaining to his contact with his sister while in the U.S. Nor, did he\ncorrect the statement that his sisters in Iraq do not know about his work with the Army.\nHe blames this on the fact that he was in the war zone, under great pressure and not\nable to concentrate properly in order to correct every error (Tr. 43).\nApplicant has no financial interest in Iraq. He has no desire to return to the\ncountry. He claims he did not contact his sisters when he worked in Iraq. He did not\n\n4\nleave the military base (Tr. 57). Applicant does not own a home, but he has a retirement\naccount valued at approximately $130,000 (Tr. 113).    \nApplicant asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship and desire to resume work with the\nArmy (AE A). He worked in a war zone in Iraq. He helped with translations of various\ndocuments (Tr. 53). Applicant\u2019s work also involved working in a tribunal and training\nsome Iraqi police (Tr. 54). Applicant expressed a desire to fight terrorism after\nSeptember 11, 2001. He further explained that he is a Christian and that he sent\nPresident Bush two letters (AE B) concerning the saving of the world from religious wars\nand massacre.  \nApplicant called a witness who has known him in the U.S. for 14 years. He met\nApplicant through an international club (social organization for people who speak foreign\nlanguages) in the United States. He testified that he was paid to testify at the hearing. In\nfact, he characterized himself as a \u201cprofessional witness.\u201d He also related that Applicant\nmaintained contact with his family in Iraq. The witness was hesitant at times but testified\nthat he believed Applicant had recent conversations with his sisters (within the last year\n(Tr. 125). He elaborated that Applicant recently expressed concerns about the safety of\nhis sisters in Iraq (Tr. 126) The witness stated that he had never heard anything negative\nabout Applicant from the other social club members (Tr. 128). The witness stated that\nApplicant was a good family man.\nApplicant presented a recommendation from a geologist friend who met him in\n1993 in Jordan at a conference (AE C). She also knows him through membership in the\ninternational club. She noted that he has spoken out in opposition to terrorism. She\nrecommends that he remain a translator/interpreter because he speaks the Iraqi dialect.\nShe believes he would be of service to the United States.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Iraq set forth in the Hearing\nExhibits, including the fact that in 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove\nSaddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s new government took\noffice. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains engulfed in violence,\nperpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and\nkidnappings have targeted the United States Armed Forces, contractors, and other\ncivilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against terrorists,\nthe threat of terrorism in Iraq remains. Terrorist groups can conduct intelligence activities\nas effectively as state intelligence services.\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\n. control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\n5\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant has three sisters who are residents and citizens of\nIraq. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges his expressed fear that if any relatives found out about\nhis translator duties, they would be subjected to grave danger by hostile interest within\nIraq. (\u00b6 1.b). The security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b). Applicant\u2019s three sisters are\ncitizens of Iraq. Two of them still reside in Iraq. Applicant maintained phone contact with\nthem frequently. He took an assignment in the War Zone in Iraq as a translator and he\nacknowledged that his sisters know about his work. Based on this evidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a),\nand (b) are raised.\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n7\nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States,\nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317,\n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of\na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are\nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to\ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated\nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8(c) \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant has maintained contact with his sisters living in Iraq\nwhile living in the United States. His wife also maintains some telephone contact with\nthem. He expressed fear about their safety in 2007 during an interview. Thus, the above\nmitigating conditions do not apply in this case.\u00b6\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing spoke to his undivided loyalty to the U.S. However,\nhe has a bond with his sisters and his wife does as well. His inconsistency about his\ncontacts with his sisters and their welfare does not provide for mitigation under the above\nreferenced guideline. There is the heightened risk that exists because his identity could\nbecome known and could result in manipulation, coercion, or pressure on Applicant.\nThese facts do not allow mitigation under this condition 8(b). \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately provided false or misleading information\nto an investigator on April 16, 2007, when he stated that he had not called or written to\nhis three sisters living in Iraq since he came to the United States in 1994. (SOR \u00b6 2.a).\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\n\n8\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process.\nAG 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\nApplicant listed in his security application that he maintained contact with his three\nsisters who are residents and citizens of Iraq. He later changed that information in an\ninterview with an investigator in 2007. He had an opportunity to clarify or correct this\ninformation in interrogatories in 2008. He made certain corrections but did not change\nthe reference to contact with his three sisters. At the hearing, he was inconsistent with\nhis statements and answers to questions by counsel. I allow for the second language\nand possible misunderstandings, but I did not find Applicant credible, especially in light of\nhis strong desire to maintain employment. \n \nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. In pertinent\npart, AG \u00b6 17 provides:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability.\nI have considered these mitigating conditions and do not find them applicable.\nThe other mitigating conditions are not relevant in this case:\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\n\n9\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant strongly averred his loyalty to\nthe United States, that he has shown a willingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nthat he desires to establish security and safety to the people in his country. He is an\neducated man and is a naturalized U.S. citizen since 1999. He worked as a translator for\nthe Army in 2006. \nApplicant, in his own words, fears for the life of his siblings if his work with the\nU.S. contractor became known.  He stated at the hearing that one of his sisters does\nknow about his work with the Army. Applicant lived in Iraq until he was in his fifties.\nThere is an increased risk that his identity could become known by someone who could\nidentify him and his family and use that information to manipulate, pressure or coerce the\nApplicant in a way that is inconsistent with U.S. national interests.\nApplicant believed the revocation was too harsh because he claimed he made a\nmistake in an interview regarding contact with his sisters. He cited the guidelines and\nbelieved that under a whole person analysis, he is clearly a loyal, honest, citizen. He\nbelieves that he should have an opportunity to continue with his work. He also stated that\nhe now has no desire to contact his sisters because indirectly they are the reason for the\nrevocation of his security clearance (Tr. 116).\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and\nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence and\npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to\nclassified information.\n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong\npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . . it is\ndeemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by\ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir.\nth\n1990).  The evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and\nsuitability.\n\n10\nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct\nAGAINST Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On July 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline G that provided the basis for its decision to deny him a security\nclearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 10, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 17,\n2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\nFebruary 27, 2009\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\ncontinue a security clearance for him. On November 25, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for\nDecember 19, 2008.\nThe hearing was held as scheduled. Four government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and two\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-B) were admitted without any objections. Applicant testified, as\nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on December 31, 2008. At Applicant\u2019s request, the\nrecord was held open until January 16, 2009. No additional documents were received.\nBased on review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant consumed\nalcohol, at times to excess and to intoxication, from approximately 1986 to at least\nMarch 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he received nonjudicial punishment in 1996 for driving\nunder the influence (DUI) (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that his license was suspended for failure to take\na breathalyzer following an arrest for DUI between 1996 and 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that he\nwas fined for an open container offense in about 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that he pleaded\nguilty to November 2006 charges of DUI and operating under suspension-alcohol and\nwas sentenced to six months in jail, suspended, and 18 months probation (SOR \u00b6 1.e);\nthat he received treatment for alcohol abuse through an employee assistance program\n(EAP) at a local center from November 2006 to about April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that he\nreceived treatment for alcohol dependence at a behavioral health facility from February\n2007 to about July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and that he was in treatment for alcohol abuse at\na community and family services center as of March 26, 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Applicant\nadmitted the allegations. His admissions are incorporated as factual findings. After\nconsidering the record evidence, I make the following additional findings.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old senior quality control analyst, who has been employed\nby a defense contractor since September 2001, following nine years of active duty\nservice in the U.S. military (Exs. 1, 2,  Tr. 24). He seeks to retain the secret-level\nsecurity clearance he has held since he was in the Navy (Ex. 1, 2).\nApplicant began to drink alcohol (beer) in about 1986 when he was 14 or 15. He\ndrank at parties with friends (Ex. 3). After he entered the U.S. military in April 1992 (Exs.\n1, 2), his drinking caused him no problems until June 1996 when he was awarded\nnonjudicial punishment for DUI. He had consumed an unrecalled amount of beer at a\nlocal bar and driven back to the base. Applicant was sitting in his vehicle listening to the\nradio when base police approached about the radio\u2019s volume. Applicant was charged\nwith DUI after failing a breathalyzer. At Captain\u2019s Mast, he was awarded a reduction in\nrate, 45 days extra duty, 45 days restriction, and forfeiture of one month\u2019s pay (half pay\neach month for two months). The sentence was suspended for six months and then\ndismissed (Ex. 3, Tr. 28). Applicant went to a week-long alcohol education class\nvoluntarily (Tr. 33-34).\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nApplicant married in August 1998. He and his spouse (now ex-wife) had a\ndaughter in December 1998 (Tr. 26). He was fined $25 for an open container violation in\nJuly 2001 while tailgating at a baseball game (Exs. 1, 2, 3, Tr. 31). That same month, he\nreceived an honorable discharge from the military (Exs. 1, 2, Tr. 26).\nIn September 2001, he began working for his current employer as a quality\ncontrol analyst in support of his former military command. Needing to retain his secret\nclearance for his duties on the military installation, Applicant executed a security\nclearance application on March 12, 2002. He disclosed his June 1996 nonjudicial\npunishment (\u201csuspended bust\u201d) and the July 2001 open container violation (Ex. 2).\nIn 2003, Applicant began drinking often to intoxication as his marital relationship\ndeteriorated. After he and his spouse divorced in mid-August 2004 (Ex. 1), he continued\nto consume alcohol at times to excess. As of the fall of 2006, if not before, Applicant\nwas drinking up to a fifth bottle of liquor on a daily basis while socializing after work at a\nbar with friends (Ex. 3, Tr. 50).\nApplicant was arrested three times on drunk driving offenses after 2001. On the\nfirst occasion, Applicant had been drinking at home. He let a friend borrow his car but it\nran out of gas not far from Applicant\u2019s home. So that the car would not be towed, this\nperson walked Applicant back to the vehicle to wait while he went to get gas. Applicant\nwas sitting in the car on private property with the keys in the ignition when the police\napproached and arrested him for drunk driving. The charge was dropped (Ex. 3, p. 29).\nWhile that charge was still pending, Applicant was pulled over for drunk driving. He\nrefused the breathalyzer and his license was suspended. He took a required drunk\ndriving class after this incident (Ex. 3, Tr. 30-31).\nOn a Friday night in early November 2006, Applicant consumed half of a fifth\nbottle of schnapps plus four beers in his home. The following morning, he was pulled\nover for speeding while en route to a local store. Citing knee injuries, Applicant declined\nto perform field sobriety tests, and he was arrested on suspicion of DUI. He failed a\nbreathalyzer at the station and was charged with two misdemeanors, illegal operation of\na motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol/drugs and illegal operation of a\nmotor vehicle under suspension-alcohol. He was also cited for two infractions,\nexceeding posted speed limit and failure to return license/registration. Detained in jail\nfor three days, he experienced alcohol withdrawal symptoms (visual hallucinations).\nApplicant pleaded not guilty to all the charges, but in February 2007, he was convicted\nof the drunk driving and operation under suspension charges. He was ordered to pay\n$1,000 ($500 for each offense, which Applicant maintains was a contribution and not a\n\nDOHA alleged, and Applicant admitted, that he was also sentenced to six months in jail, suspended.\n1\nThe only court record available for review reflects a sentence for each offense of a $500 fine and 18 months\n(Ex. 4). The court record does not indicate whether the 18 months was to be spent in jail or on probation. Nor\ndoes it indicate that the 18 month sentences were to be spent concurrently.\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nfine, see Ex. 3), and he was placed on 18 months probation.  The motor vehicle\n1\ninfractions were nolled. (Ex. 4).\nFollowing his November 2006 arrest for drunk driving, Applicant realized he had\na problem with alcohol. He stopped socializing with those coworkers with whom he\ndrank at the bar (Tr. 51), and took the opportunity to move to second shift so that he\ncould avoid them (Tr. 52). At the referral of an EAP program, Applicant received\ncounseling for alcohol abuse with a therapist from November 2006 to April 2007 (Exs. 2,\n3, Tr. 35-36). The frequency of his sessions with the clinician increased from once\nweekly to twice weekly and eventually three times weekly (Ex. 3). Applicant was advised\nby this therapist that he should not drink alcohol (Tr. 42).\nAt the referral of the therapist, he underwent a psychiatric evaluation by an\nosteopathic (D.O.) physician with a behavioral health practice on February 3, 2007.\nApplicant admitted during the evaluation that he had consumed alcohol the previous\nday; that he was drinking every third day, in quantity of 750 ml of alcohol per occasion\nto deal with anxiety; and that he was experiencing alcohol-related blackouts and had\ncravings for alcohol. He was given a principal diagnosis of alcohol dependence and\nstarted on Campral for his alcohol use, Sertraline for anxiety and depressive symptoms,\nand Trazodone for problems sleeping. He was advised to abstain from alcohol (Tr. 42),\nto continue his sessions with his therapist, and to return for medication management in\nthree weeks time. Applicant cancelled appointments with the D.O. scheduled for March\n2, 2007, and March 9, 2007. During a session with the D.O. on March 14, 2007,\nApplicant reported that he felt better, but also that he was still drinking alcohol. His\ncondition was assessed as stable and his medications were continued for 30 days with\none refill. Applicant was advised to continue his therapy sessions. During a follow-up\nsession with the D.O. on May 9, 2007, Applicant reported he had abstained from alcohol\nfor the past week and a half, and that he was compliant with his medications. The D.O.\nassessed Applicant\u2019s condition as stable and improving. On May 22, 2007, Applicant\ncomplained to the D.O. by telephone of a negative health reaction from the Trazodone.\nHe was advised to seek medical help immediately, which he failed to do. On July 20,\n2007, Applicant failed to show for an appointment scheduled with the D.O. (Ex. 3).\nApplicant attended a few Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings between January and\nApril 2007 (Tr. 43).\nFor a periodic reinvestigation of his security clearance, Applicant executed a\nQNSP on April 3, 2007. He listed his 1996 nonjudicial punishment for DUI, the 2001\nopen container violation, and the November drunk driving offense for which he was on\n\nApplicant testified that two counselors told him that he could drink a little (\u201cI needed to drink because\n2\nI could go into arrest because of the amount of alcohol I was drinking back in the time when I was drinking\nheavily. And there was something to do with it had to all do with my heart.\u201d Tr. 50).\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nprobation. In response to inquiry into his medical record, Applicant indicated he had\nbeen seeing a therapist since November 2006, and the D.O. for medication only since\nFebruary 2007 (Ex. 1).\nOn August 23, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator, in\npart about his alcohol use, related offenses, and his treatment. Applicant explained that\nhe began to drink heavily in 2003 during his separation from his spouse and that he\noften drank to intoxication. Although unable to recall the amounts consumed, Applicant\nestimated that it took about a half bottle of schnapps and four to five beers for him to\nbecome intoxicated. He indicated that he had been arrested twice for DUI, in June 1996\nwhile in the military, and in November 2006, and that he drank until November 2006,\ndaily at least four beers and two shots of liquor. He denied any consumption of alcohol\nsince November 2006 and he expressed an intent to continue abstinence in the future\n(Ex. 3).\nDOHA subsequently asked Applicant to confirm the accuracy of the investigator\u2019s\nreport of the August 2007 interview and to explain why his license had been suspended\nat the time of his arrest in November 2006. In his response dated March 26, 2008,\nApplicant related that he did not recall telling the investigator that he had not consumed\nalcohol since November 2006. He provided previously undisclosed information about a\ntherapy consult in early 2007 wherein he had been told that he should \u201cdrink little and\nnot overdo it because [he] could die or go into [an] alcoholic shock.\u201d  Applicant admitted\n2\nthat after being prescribed medications, he had \u201cslipped up a few times,\u201d so he was\nback in treatment with a new therapist. He added that he was subject to drug testing as\na condition of his probation so it was another reason for him to abstain (Ex. 3).\nApplicant saw this new therapist only once or twice (Tr. 41). He continued to\nconsume alcohol, including a couple of times when he was on probation knowing that\nhe risked jail by drinking (Tr. 44). Applicant\u2019s probation ended in September 2008 but he\nhas not regained his license (Tr. 45). Applicant drank liquor, in quantities varying from\nless than a pint to more than a pint, 10 or 12 times during the last six months of 2008.\nOver the weekend of December 3-14, 2008, he consumed a pint of liquor that was\nbrought to him by a friend. He was going through a rough time with his daughter (Tr. 37-\n41, 49). He tried contacting supportive friends for help but did not reach them (Tr. 53),\nso he called an old friend and asked him to bring the liquor (Tr. 56). Applicant has not\ntaken his Campral medication since summer 2008 (Tr. 37, 44). He no longer considers\nhimself an alcoholic because he has his alcohol consumption under control (Tr. 42).\nApplicant does not plan to drink, but family problems (ex-wife quitting her job and losing\nher house and car, issues with his daughter) have led him to consume alcohol (Tr. 45-\n46). He has developed new hobbies to help him deal with the stress (Tr. 47-48).\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nApplicant has the full confidence of the military officers who have oversight over\nhis work at the military base. As a quality assurance supervisor, Applicant is responsible\nfor the integrity of a safety program. (Exs. A, B) His work was recognized by an\ninspection board as among the best in the fleet (Ex. A). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure\nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\nuntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant was punished by Captain\u2019s Mast for DUI in June 1996. In\nJuly 2001, he was fined for an open container violation. While in his present\nemployment and holding a secret clearance, Applicant was arrested three times for\ndrunk driving. In the first incident, he was charged with DUI after he was found sitting\nbehind the wheel of his vehicle with the keys in the ignition. There is no evidence that\nhe had driven on that occasion, and the DUI charge was dismissed. However, he does\nnot deny that he had been drinking. He was also not convicted of DUI in the second\nincident, but he acknowledges that he was drinking and driving (Tr. 30), and his license\nwas suspended for refusing to submit to a breathalyzer. He was driving on that\nsuspended license when he was caught drunk driving in November 2006. Applicant was\nconvicted of both operating a motor vehicle under the influence and of operating a\nmotor vehicle under suspension. AG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d clearly applies.\nFor some time before his November 2006 arrest, Applicant had been drinking up\nto a fifth of liquor on a daily basis. This habitual consumption to excess, which raises\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d led to a serious alcohol problem. In February 2007, the\nD.O. diagnosed him as alcohol dependent. AG \u00b6 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol\nabuse or alcohol dependence,\u201d also applies.\nApplicant deserves credit for recognizing in November 2006 that he had an\nalcohol problem, and for seeking help through an EAP program and counseling. Yet,\ndespite ongoing sessions with a therapist, he continued to consume alcohol as of mid-\nMarch 2007, even after being placed on Campral medication by the D.O. As of an\noffice visit with the D.O. on May 9, 2007, Applicant had managed to abstain from\nalcohol for more than one week. But he relapsed again into sporadic drinking due to\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nfamily stressors. During the last six months of 2008, he consumed alcohol on 10 to 12\noccasions, up to a pint of liquor at times. This drinking was contrary to the medical\nadvice from the D.O. and to the clinical advice from the therapist whom he had seen\nfrom November 2006 to April 2007. Two other counselors, whom he had seen only\nbriefly, apparently advised him that he could drink a little to avoid the health\nconsequences of total withdrawal. Applicant\u2019s consumption of up to a pint of liquor is\nclearly contrary to even that advice. Since Applicant has not completed an alcohol\nrehabilitation program, AG \u00b6 22(f), \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or\ndependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program,\u201d does not apply.\nHowever, his recent drinking was a violation of his probation. Applicant admitted he\nrisked jail time had he been caught, so AG \u00b622(g), \u201cfailure to follow any court order\nregarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence,\u201d is pertinent.\nConcerning the potential conditions in mitigation under AG \u00b6 23, his relapse\nhistory precludes consideration of AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The weekend before his hearing, Applicant drank\nabout a pint of liquor that a friend brought over at his request.\nApplicant\u2019s voluntary counseling from November 2006 to April 2007, aided by\nmedication from February 2007 to summer 2008, is action taken to overcome his\nproblem (see AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues\nof alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser).\u201d He elected to work second shift so that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have an excuse to\ngo out and drink in the afternoons after work\u201d (Tr. 51), and he developed hobbies to\nalleviate some of the stress and anxiety that led him to abuse alcohol in the past. But\nAG \u00b6 23(b) cannot be fully applied. He has not abstained from alcohol for any significant\nperiod. He shows insufficient insight into his alcohol problem, as evidenced by his\nadmission that he does not now consider himself to be an alcoholic since he is not\ndrinking at previous levels.\nThe recurrence and recency of his relapses and the absence of any present\ntreatment or involvement in AA or similar organization preclude consideration of AG\n23(c), \u201cthe individual is a current employee who is participating in counseling or a\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making\nsatisfactory progress,\u201d and AG \u00b6 23(d), \u201cthe individual has successfully completed\ninpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of\nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized treatment program.\u201d Applicant stopped attending his\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n9\ncounseling sessions with the therapist in April 2007. He returned to counseling with a\nnew therapist in March 2008, but attended only one or two sessions. While he has a\nprescription for Campral, he has not taken the drug since summer 2008. Although he\nnow has friends who attend AA, he has not shown how their involvement in AA helps\nhim. There is no recent prognosis from a clinician that could dispel the security\nconcerns raised by his ongoing abusive relationship with alcohol.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant bears a substantial burden of\nmitigation, especially where he does not fully satisfy any of the Guideline G mitigating\nconditions. He has not allowed his abusive use of alcohol to interfere with his work\nperformance. Accountable for the integrity of a very stringent quality control program,\nApplicant holds a highly trusted position and he has not disappointed those military\nofficers who rely on him. But security is a 24-hour-per-day responsibility, and Applicant\ncontinues to struggle with his alcohol problem. Since at least 2003, he has turned to\ndrinking to cope with family stress caused by the dissolution of his marriage and more\nrecently by his ex-wife quitting her job and losing her home. Problems with his daughter\nled him to call new friends for help, but also to ask an old friend for liquor in December\n2008. He is no longer on probation for his November 2006 drunk driving offense, but that\ndoes not fully mitigate the serious alcohol consumption concerns.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nELIZABETH M.

In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 44-year-old woman who is the co-founder/chief executive officer and co-owner of her own business. The business has contracts with the Department of Defense. Her husband is the co-founder/chief financial officer/managing director and co- owner. The third co-owner is also a co-founder and president. Applicant was born in Taiwan and received her bachelor\u2019s degree while there. She came to the U.S. in 1995 to pursue a masters in business and completed the degree in 1997. She was married when she came to the U.S. but the marriage was failing and her husband did not accompany her. She met her future husband, a U.S. citizen, in 1996. He was also pursuing a graduate degree at the time. She returned to Taiwan in 1997 and realized she had some life changing decisions to make. She decided to get divorced and return to the U.S. to pursue a career and permanently settle. In 1998 she and her husband married. Both she and her husband earned their certified public accountant certificates. She worked in business until two months before her first child was born in March 2001. Her second child was born in September 2003 and she remained at home until 2005. She has since resumed working in the joint business venture.2 Applicant returned to Taiwan in September ",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Elizabeth L. Newman, Esq. \n \n______________ \n \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline B, \nForeign Influence and Guideline C, Foreign Preference. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \nOn March 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 21, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on July 11, 2008, and reassigned to me on July 21, 2008. DOHA \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 13, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nissued a notice of hearing on July 23, 2008, and the case was scheduled at the request \nof Applicant\u2019s counsel for July 31, 2008. Applicant waived the 15-day notice \nrequirement. I convened the hearing on the scheduled date.  \n \nRulings on Procedure and Evidence \n \nThe government offered fourteen hearing exhibits (HE) and requested I take \nadministrative notice of each exhibit. After I reviewed the exhibits I took administrative \nnotice of HE I through V. I declined to take administrative notice of the other exhibits as \nthey were not official documents from government sources whose accuracy cannot \nreasonably be questioned, but rather were news releases.  \n \nI permitted department counsel to submit the documents now marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE). He offered GE 1 and 2 which were admitted without \nobjection.  \n \nGE 3, originally offered as a hearing exhibit is a memoranda of facts about the \ncountry of Taiwan. It was admitted without objection.  \n \nGE 4 through 12 were originally offered as hearing exhibits. Applicant\u2019s counsel \nobjected to GE 4-12 on the grounds of authentication, reliability, materiality and \nrelevance. Specifically that they were not reliable, were piece meal and not a complete \nrecord and they were irrelevant to the issues in subject case, as they did not deal with \nnaturalized U.S. citizens, but rather dealt with export violations by U.S. companies. \nDepartment counsel\u2019s position was that the documents reflected the U.S. concerns \nabout industrial espionage and showed the country of Taiwan reflected a heightened \nrisk factor to be considered. I did not admit GE 4-8. These exhibits were news releases \nfrom the U.S. Department of Commerce reflecting snippets of information about U.S. \ncompanies that had settled allegations that the company had attempted to or had \nillegally exported items to Taiwan, among other countries. Although the rules of \nevidence are relaxed, the administrative judge is still required to ensure evidence \noffered is reliable, relevant and material to the security concerns raised. U.S. companies \nengaging in illegal exports to foreign countries are too far removed from security interest \nalleged in this case. These news releases do not comply with even the low threshold of \nreliability, relevance and materiality. In addition, the medium used to present \ninformation, that is a news release, barely provides the reader with more than a glimpse \nof the factual issues and does not meet the minimum bar or reliability. GE 9 was also \nnot admitted for the same reason above. This news release reflected that two people \nwere indicted for violation of export licensing laws. The article says the items were \ndestined for Taiwan. No other information was provided. In addition, none of the above \ndocuments comply with the authentication requirements listed in accordance DoD \nDirective 5220.6 Section 5 (b), specifically they are not \u201crecords compiled in the regular \ncourse of business, or other physical evidence, other than investigative report\u201d that have \nbeen \u201dfurnished to the Department concerned by an investigative agency pursuant to its \nresponsibilities in connection with assisting the head of the Department concerned to \nsafeguard classified information within industry.\u201d \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nGE 10 is a copy of an indictment dated October 2005 for an individual alleged to \nhave violated U.S. export laws. No information was provided whether this person was \ntargeted by a foreign agent or whether the individual was convicted. The indictment \nalone is not enough to raise it to the level of relevance and materiality. The above \nauthentication requirement has not been met. \n \nGE 11 and 12 were admitted. GE 11 is a news release from the United States \nAttorney\u2019s Office detailing the final sentencing of a defendant who pleaded guilty for \nunlawful removal of classified material from the Department of State and making false \nstatements to the government. GE 12 is a stipulation of fact between the U.S. and the \ndefendant in the above case, detailing his offenses and how he was targeted by a \nTaiwanese intelligence officer. I found these documents specifically relevant to the issue \nof an individual being targeted by the Taiwanese government.1  \n \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibit (AE) A-B, which were admitted without \nobjection. Two witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on August 7, 2008 \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old woman who is the co-founder/chief executive officer \nand co-owner of her own business. The business has contracts with the Department of \nDefense. Her husband is the co-founder/chief financial officer/managing director and co-\nowner. The third co-owner is also a co-founder and president. Applicant was born in \nTaiwan and received her bachelor\u2019s degree while there. She came to the U.S. in 1995 \nto pursue a masters in business and completed the degree in 1997. She was married \nwhen she came to the U.S. but the marriage was failing and her husband did not \naccompany her. She met her future husband, a U.S. citizen, in 1996. He was also \npursuing a graduate degree at the time. She returned to Taiwan in 1997 and realized \nshe had some life changing decisions to make. She decided to get divorced and return \nto the U.S. to pursue a career and permanently settle. In 1998 she and her husband \nmarried. Both she and her husband earned their certified public accountant certificates. \nShe worked in business until two months before her first child was born in March 2001. \nHer second child was born in September 2003 and she remained at home until 2005. \nShe has since resumed working in the joint business venture.2 \n \n \nApplicant returned to Taiwan in September 2001 to introduce her daughter to her \nfamily residing there. She returns yearly to visit her family, so they will have an \n \n1 Tr. 17-32. \n \n2 Tr. 33-38, 52-53, 87-89, 105. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nopportunity to know her children. She approximates that she spent between four and six \nweeks visiting her relatives in Taiwan in the years 2001 through 2004. In 2005 and \n2006, she stayed for two weeks because she had resumed work. In 2008, she also \nspent two weeks.3  \n \n \nIn 1998 after Applicant got married she started the process to become a U.S. \ncitizen. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen on October 26, 2004. She testified the \nreason it took so long for her to obtain her citizenship is because the immigration \nprocess was backed up. She eventually hired an immigration lawyer to assist her.4  \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant traveled to Taiwan. She obtained a visa from Taiwan because \nit was required of all U.S. citizens. During this trip Applicant brought both her new U.S. \npassport and her Taiwanese passport. Both her U.S. and Taiwanese passports were \nstamped. She testified that when she arrived in Taiwan, after an 18-hour flight, with her \ntwo small children, she and the children were tired and she found it expedited the \nprocess of getting through the entry process by showing both her Taiwan and U.S. \npassport. She testified that because she spoke Chinese the immigration officer \nassumed she was using her Taiwanese passport. She advised him she was using her \nU.S. passport, and both passports were stamped. After this first trip she has not used \nthe Taiwanese passport. She credibly testified that she is willing to renounce any \ncitizenship rights she may have with Taiwan. She surrendered her passport to her \nfacility security manager and defaced the passport by writing the word \u201cvoid\u201d on all of its \npages.5 The facility security manager provided a statement verifying he had her \npassport in his possession and should she request its return he would notify the \nDefense Security Service.6 She did not send it back to Taiwan or formally renounce her \ncitizenship because she was advised that by doing so it may heighten Taiwan\u2019s interest \nin her because they may suspect her reason for returning the passport and formally \nrenouncing her Taiwanese citizenship is because she is applying for a U.S. security \nclearance. She obtained paperwork from the government of Taiwan to go through the \nrenouncement procedures and verified she has no criminal history or delinquent taxes \nin Taiwan.7 Applicant has never attempted to obtain Taiwanese passports or citizenship \ndocuments for her two children.  \n \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s financial interests are in the U.S. She has no financial interests \nor potential inheritance interests in Taiwan. She estimates her financial worth, including \nshe and her husband\u2019s assets, both business and personal, is approximately $750,000 \nto $1 million. Their business employs approximately 25 people, many of whom are \n \n3 Tr. 38-40. \n \n4 Tr. 40-42. \n \n5 Tr. 42-44, 62-76; Answer to SOR. \n \n6 Id. \n \n7 Id.; AE B. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nretired military officers. No Taiwanese nationals are employed by their business. She \nalso estimates the company did approximate $1.5 million in revenue in 2007, with a \nprofit of about 13%. This year they anticipate revenue of approximately $3.5 million and \na similar profit. She and her husband own two houses.8  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s widowed mother lives in Taiwan. She is 77 years old and raised eight \nchildren. Her father died when Applicant was nine years old. He was a chef by trade. \nHer mother never worked outside of the home. She was raised on a farm and has no \nconnection to the government or military, nor is she involved in politics. She lives in an \napartment that she has already titled in her son\u2019s name. This same son lives with his \nfamily in the mother\u2019s home.9  \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s brothers live in Taiwan. The older is a security guard at a \nfactory. Applicant does not know what is manufactured at the factory. Her brother\u2019s wife \nis a housewife. They have one son who works on an assembly line in a factory. \nApplicant is not aware of what is assembled. Applicant\u2019s other brother is married and \nhas two children. Her younger brother who lives with their mother works for a business \nthat manufactures promotional items for businesses. Neither brother is connected to the \ngovernment, military or has political inclinations10.  \n \n \nApplicant has five sisters. One lives in Canada and is a contractor doing home \nrenovations. Applicant has very little contact with her. One sister is a retired accounting \nsupervisor who was in the shoe business. Three years ago she joined her husband and \nthey work in a company manufacturing medical devices. They have two children. She \ndoes not know what her nephew does. Her niece went to school in the U.S. and is now \nliving in Singapore. Another sister is retired from a financial institution where she sold \nstocks and bonds. She is now a home maker. This sister is divorced and has a grown \ndaughter who works as an accountant for a commercial company. Another sister is a \nhomemaker. Her husband owns a small printing company. The last sister is a certified \ninsurance salesperson. She is single and lived with Applicant for a few months while in \nthe U.S. Applicant is unaware of any specific contacts her relatives may have with the \nTaiwanese or People\u2019s Republic of China businesses.11  \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s siblings are involved in technology or the corporate world. \nWhen Applicant visits her mother and siblings in Taiwan they do not talk about her \nbusiness, but rather their interests are about typical family and children issues.12 \n \n \n8 Tr. 100-104. \n \n9 Tr. 44-45, 55. \n \n10 Tr. 46-47, 79-82. \n \n11 Tr. 47-50, 82-91, 110. \n \n12 Tr. 50-53. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant has given her mother birthday and holiday gifts in the past, but does \nnot provide any financial support to her or any other family member. Her mother is \naware that she is a partner in a company involving engineering services, but is not privy \nto any other information. She speaks with her mother about once a week or once every \ntwo weeks. She may speak with one or some of her siblings about once a month, but it \nis irregular as to whom she speaks and how often. Her discussion topics are of a \npersonal nature about the family. Applicant\u2019s family is not aware of any specifics about \nher business. Applicant does not maintain contact with any friends in Taiwan. She is \nfriends with two couples in the U.S. that are Taiwanese, but are not associated with the \nTaiwanese government or other Taiwanese companies. One couple are naturalized \nU.S. citizens and the other hold \u201cgreen\u201d cards and are in the process of obtaining their \nU.S. citizenship. Applicant has never been contacted, retained, or arrested by any \nrepresentative of the Taiwanese government.13  \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that if she was ever placed in a position of having to \nchoose between her family living in Taiwan and her loyalty to the U.S., she strongly and \nadamantly testified that she would never compromise her loyalty to the U.S. She has \nactually discussed this issue with her husband. She credibly testified that her \nconscience would not allow her to betray the U.S. It is not something she would be able \nto live with. Her first priority would be to her children and husband who are American \ncitizens and she would not put them or her country at risk.14 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s business has two sides, one that contracts with the Department of \nDefense and the other that provides financial consulting services to other companies. \nThe two different business interests are not located together. The financial consulting \nside of the business does not deal directly with any Taiwanese contractors. The \nconsulting side of the company may have dealings with company clients that may have \nbusiness dealings with Taiwanese companies, but neither Applicant nor her company \nhas direct contact with the client company\u2019s clients and none of these companies are \ninvolved in the defense contract side of their business. Furthermore the relationship with \nthese companies is in the area of financial support and accounting services.15 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s life is firmly rooted in the U.S. She is registered to vote in the U.S. \nand has not voted in Taiwan since her departure. Her husband\u2019s family lives close and \nthey celebrate traditional American holidays together. She has not received any benefits \nfrom Taiwan, including health benefits.16  \n \n \n13 Tr. 54-55, 91-100.  \n \n14 Tr. 71-73, 111-112. \n \n15 Tr. 98, 126-137. \n \n16 Tr. 55-62, 91-92. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s business partner has known her for more than 12 years and their \nfamilies have socialized together. They visit each others homes and have developed a \nhigh level of trust. He believes Applicant is a loyal American.17 \n \nTaiwan and PRC18 \n \n \nIn 1949, Taiwan was populated by refugees fleeing a civil war in China. That \nsame year, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), and a separate, independent government was established in Taiwan. The PRC \ndoes not recognize Taiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China.\u201d \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-part democracy. Through nearly five decades of hard work and \nsound economic management, Taiwan has transformed itself from an underdeveloped, \nagricultural island to an economic power that is a leading producer of high-technology \ngoods. On January 1, 1979, the United States formally recognized the PRC as the sole \nlegal government of China. The U.S. also announced that it would maintain cultural, \ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people on Taiwan. The Taiwan \nRelations Act (TRA) signed into law on April 10, 1979, created the legal authority for the \nconduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan. The American Institute in Taiwan, a private \nnonprofit corporation with offices in Taiwan, is authorized to issue visas, accept \npassport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in Taiwan. A counterpart \norganization was established by Taiwan. It has multiple offices in the U.S. \n \n \nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. \ndoes not support Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s membership in \nappropriate international organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nwhich it joined in 2002, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the \nAsian Development Bank. In addition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for \nTaiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in organizations where its membership is not possible. \n \n \nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its defensive \ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell defensive military equipment to Taiwan, in \naccordance with the TRA. President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the United States \nwould do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help Taiwan\u2019s defense and approved a substantial sale \nof U.S. weapons to Taiwan, including destroyers, anti-submarine aircraft, and diesel \nsubmarines. The White House also was more accommodating to visits from Taiwan\u2019s \nofficials than previous U.S. administrations, and permitted visits from Taiwan\u2019s president \nin 2001 and 2003, and Taiwan\u2019s vice president and defense minister in 2002. \n \n \nSince then, there have been changes in U.S.-Taiwan relations. Taiwan\u2019s new \npresident disavowed key concepts long embraced by the opposing party - the \u201cstatus \nquo\u201d that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it - and instead has adopted the \nmore provocative position that Taiwan already \u201cis an independent, sovereign country,\u201d a \n \n17 Tr. 123-125. \n \n18 Information in this section is from HE I, II, III, IV, and V.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n\u201cstatus quo\u201d he promises to maintain. There was also a series of recent corruption \nscandals. \n \n \nIn response to Taiwan\u2019s political developments, the U.S. administration appears \nto have dialed back its earlier enthusiasm for supporting Taiwan\u2019s initiatives. While still \npursuing a close relationship with Taiwan, U.S. officials now appear to be balancing \ncriticisms of the PRC military buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and \nwarnings to the effect that U.S. support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.  \n \n \nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over \na billion people and an economy growing at about 10% per year. The PRC has an \nauthoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The PRC has a \npoor record with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and its practices \ninclude arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of \nprisoners. \n \n \nBoth the PRC and Taiwan are known to be active collectors of U.S. economic \nintelligence. The PRC also maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving Foreign Preference arises: \u201cWhen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: I have specifically considered AG \u00b6 10 (a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege \nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a \ncurrent foreign passport\u201d) and (b) (\u201caction to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign \ncitizenship by an American citizen\u201d). Applicant held a Taiwanese passport, after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen, until she defaced and relinquished it to her facilities security \nmanager. She also used both her U.S. and Taiwanese passport during a trip to Taiwan. \nI find (a) applies to the extent that she used her foreign passport, although not \nexclusively, when she entered Taiwan on one occasion. I find (b) applies under the \nsame set of facts.  \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 11 (b) (\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship\u201d); (c) (\u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of \nforeign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor\u201d); and (e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.) Applicant has expressed a \n\n \n10 \n \n \nwillingness to renounce any citizenship ties she may have with Taiwan. She does not \nconsider herself a dual citizen. She completed some aspects of formally renouncing any \ncitizenship ties she may have with Taiwan, but was directed to stop the process so as \nnot to create a heightened awareness of her application for a security clearance. She \nhas written \u201cvoid\u201d on her Taiwanese passport. Although she used the passport on a trip \nto Taiwan, it was in conjunction with her U.S. passport. She has obtained the \nappropriate visas to enter Taiwan and followed all other requirements for U.S. citizens \nto travel to Taiwan. She has since voided the passport and not used it. I find Applicant \nhas mitigated the foreign preference security concerns.  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \u201cForeign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered them all and especially considered AG \u00b6 7 (a) (\u201ccontact \nwith a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other \nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion\u201d); and (b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreates a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign country \nby providing that information\u201d). Applicant\u2019s mother and siblings are citizens and \nresidents of Taiwan, a country known to be an active collector or U.S. economic \nintelligence. This creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. \nTherefore (a) and (b) have been raised by the evidence. \nAG \u00b6 8 describes conditions that may be mitigating. I have considered them all \nand especially considered AG 8 \u00b6 (a) (\u201c the nature of the relationships with foreign \nperson, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of \nthose person in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d); (b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of \ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign \nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflicts of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d); (c) (\u201ccontact \n\n \n11 \n \n \nor communication with the foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d)  \nI do not find (c) applicable because Applicant\u2019s communicates regularly with her \nmother and visits her and some of her siblings on a semi-regular basis so that her \nchildren can get to know their extended family.  \nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has lived in the U.S. since 1998. She \nreceived her master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university in 1997. She returned to Taiwan the \nsame year to contemplate her future. Her decision to move to the U.S. was a thorough \nthought-out process, rather than a default decision. She contemplated its long-term \nramifications on both her personal and professional life. She chose to leave Taiwan and \nmake the U.S. her home. Part of her decision to return was to marry her present \nhusband and make a life in the U.S. She is now the mother of two U.S. born children \nand a successful business woman. She and her husband have no assets in Taiwan and \nhave substantial business and personal assets in the U.S. Her mother, who lives in \nTaiwan, has never worked outside the home. None of her siblings work for the \ngovernment of Taiwan. Although some work in the manufacturing industry, none of it \ncan be characterized as high technology. There is no indication that any of her relatives \nliving in Taiwan are aware of the specifics of her business or do they have any \ngovernment contacts. Taiwan collects U.S. intelligence, as does other U.S. allies. It \ndoes not have a poor human rights record and there is no indication that it uses \ncoercion in its intelligence operations. Applicant has considered what she would do if \nshe was faced with a choice between her family living in Taiwan and the security of the \nU.S. She has contemplated what it would mean and discussed it with her husband. She \ncredibly testified that she could never live with herself if she betrayed the U.S. Faced \nwith her maternal bond to her children, her marriage, and the loyalty she has for the \nU.S. versus her familial relationships in Taiwan, she would resolve the conflict in favor \nof the U.S. I find it unlikely that Applicant would ever be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of Taiwan or her relatives and the interests of her \nimmediate family and the U.S. I further find there is no conflict of interest, because \nApplicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. that \nshe can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in the favor of the United States. \nTherefore, I find (a) and (b) are applicable. No other mitigating condition is applicable.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. Her husband and two children were all born in the U.S. She has been in the \nU.S. since 1997. Her life is in the U.S. now. She is the co-founder and co-owner of a \nsuccessful business. She and her husband have substantial assets in the U.S. She has \nnone in Taiwan. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties in Taiwan. Taiwan is \nan ally of the United States. However, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to \nthe United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d19 The distinctions between \nfriendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution. Relationships between \nnations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly \nnations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view \nas important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations \nhave engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of the nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant to assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable government coercion. The \nrisk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has \nan authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependant upon the \ngovernment or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.  \n \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government, a poor human rights record, and has \na very aggressive espionage program. The U.S. officially supports the \u201cone China\u201d \npolicy. However, to treat the PRC and Taiwan the same is to ignore reality. They \ncurrently function as separate entities. That is not to say that the PRC is irrelevant to \nthis case. The PRC conducts intelligence operations in Taiwan. The threat to Taiwan \nfrom the PRC is real. It is this threat that is the impetus to Taiwan\u2019s defense spending. It \nalso provides motivation for Taiwan\u2019s intelligence gathering. The threat from the PRC \nalso provides motivation for Taiwan to keep the U.S. as a friend, as it is dependent on \nthe U.S. for arms and defense.  \n \nTaiwan is a democracy, does not have a poor human rights record, and is \ndependent upon the United States for arms, as well as its defense against the PRC. \nTaiwan is known to conduct intelligence operations again the United States, but there is \nno indication that Taiwan utilizes coercion against its citizens for espionage purposes. \nMany of our allies conduct intelligence gathering against the U.S. Taiwan would be \nrisking a great deal by raising the stakes, and attempting to use duress against one of \n \n19 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nits citizens in an attempt to coerce a U.S. citizen to commit espionage. Applicant\u2019s \nmother and her siblings are also not good candidates for coercion as they are not \ndependent upon the government of Taiwan. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence and, \nforeign preference. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline C: \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2 b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She provided false answers on her security clearance questionnaire concerning \nunpaid judgments, bankruptcy filings, unpaid debts, and garnishments. Applicant has \nfailed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under financial \nconsiderations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n \n \n1\nFebruary 12, 2009\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on April 23, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct \n  \n \nOn July 20, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On \nOctober 16, 2008, I was assigned the case. On October 22, 2008, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing which was held on November 5, 2008. \nApplicant appeared at that hearing and requested a continuance. For good cause the \ncontinuance was granted. The SOR was amended; and on November 19, 2008, \nApplicant answered the amended allegations. On November 25, 2008, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling a second hearing which was held on December 3, 2008. \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 13, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through L, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On December 10, 2008, 12 pages of additional material \nwere submitted. Department Counsel had no objection to the material, which was \nadmitted into the record as Ex. M. Transcripts (Tr.) were received on December 12, \n2008 and January 12, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b61.b, 2.b, \n2.c., 2.d, 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c of the SOR. She admitted the remaining factual allegations, \nwith explanations.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old senior systems engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since October 2001, and is seeking to maintain a top secret security \nclearance. Applicant has a master\u2019s degree in divinity and a PhD in counseling. (Tr. \n117)  \n \n \nFrom January 1970 through October 2001, Applicant worked for a government \nagency, retiring as a systems engineer. While employed, Applicant claimed zero \nexemptions on her employee exemption form (W 4), which resulted in her employer \ntaking the maximum amount of tax from her bi-weekly pay. (Tr. 49) Applicant\u2019s \nretirement pension was approximately $37,000 in 2002, has increased slightly each \nyear, and was $40,000 in 2007. No taxes were ever withheld from her pension. \nApplicant\u2019s taxable income nearly doubled from 2001 ($68,000) to 2002 ($126,000) \nwhen she acquired her new job. She started her new job two days after her retirement. \nShe retired on a Friday and started her current job on a Monday. (Tr. 46)  \n \n \nApplicant married in 1976 and separated in September 2001. (Tr. 56) During the \nmarriage, her husband handled the family\u2019s finances. (Tr. 47) From mid-1980s to mid-\n2001, Applicant\u2019s husband operated a general contracting business. (Tr. 124) \nApplicant\u2019s husband was hired to work on an individual\u2019s home. That individual obtained \na $23,000 default judgment against Applicant and her husband. Applicant first became \naware of the problem in July 2000. A number of letters were sent to her home \n \n \n \n2\n\nconcerning this action. (Tr. 60) Applicant\u2019s husband told her not to worry about it. \nFollowing the entry of the judgment, when her wages were garnished, Applicant hired \nan attorney to assist her. She was distraught and annoyed money was being taken from \nher pay check. (Tr. 95)  \nFrom 1998 or 1999 until the date of the second hearing, Applicant failed to file \neither federal or state income tax returns or pay income taxes, penalties, or interest due. \nIt is a misdemeanor to fail to file state and federal income tax. (Ex. 13) During a January \n2007 interview, Applicant stated that every two years or so, she received letters from tax \nauthorities concerning her nonpayment of taxes. (Ex. 9) She said she received letter, \nopened them, and read them. (Tr. 52) The letters stated how much she owed in taxes. \nShe asserts the letters never mentioned tax liens, but did state the outstanding balance \nowed. (Tr. 105) She assumed, once her taxes were filed, she would receive a refund.  \nOver the years, Applicant employed three accountants to help her file her taxes. \nShe never showed the letters from the tax authority to either of the first two accountants \nwho were helping her with her taxes. (Tr. 80) \n \nIn November 1994, the state obtained a tax lien against Applicant in the amount \nof $33,381. (Ex. 5) In July 2000, an individual obtained a $23,080 judgment against \nApplicant. (Ex. 2) In November 2000, a homeowners association obtained a $617 \njudgment against Applicant. (Ex. 3) The action had been filed in October 1999. \nApplicant was advised by a foreclosure specialist she needed to apply for bankruptcy \nprotection in attempt to forestall the foreclosure on her home. In June 2000 and April \n2001, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (Ex. 6, 7, 8) On October 2002, \nthe state filed a $69,954 tax lien against Applicant. (Ex. 4) In 2001, the home went to \nforeclosure. \n \nIn late 2001 or early 2002, after the foreclosure on the home and the \ngarnishment of her wages, Applicant came to believe she could not trust what her \nhusband told her. (Tr. 96) Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished from January 2001 until \nOctober 2001. Approximately $100 was garnished from her bi-weekly pay. When she \nchanged jobs, the garnishment stopped. (Tr. 97) She has made no additional payments \non this judgment after the last garnishment payment in 2001. Applicant believes this is \nnot her obligation, but her husband\u2019s obligation. However, Applicant stated she would \ndo what she needed to do to clear up her record. She asserted, if she has to pay this \njudgment to do so, she would pay it. (Tr. 92, 99) No evidence of payment was \npresented. \n \nIn August 2003, Applicant received the assistance of a tax preparer to help her \ncomplete her past due returns. Returns were prepared for 1998, 1999, and 2000 and \nsigned by the accountant on August 15, 2003. (Tr. 83) All that was required was for \nApplicant to sign and submit the returns. Applicant failed to submit the forms. Applicant \nconsulted a second paid tax consultant regarding her unpaid taxes. (Tr. 162) No returns \nwere filed until after the second hearing. Applicant admits she did not file her tax returns \ndue to her own negligence. (Tr. 158)  \n \n \n \n \n3\n\n \nIn November 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27a, which \nasked if, during the prior seven years, she had filed a petition for bankruptcy. Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 27b, which asked if, during the prior seven years, her wages \nhad been garnished or any property repossessed. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question \n27c, which asked if, during the prior seven years, any lien had been placed against her \nproperty for failing to pay taxes.  \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27a and 27 b, which asked if, during the \nprior seven years, she had ever been more than 180 days delinquent on any debt or if, \nat the time she completed the e-QIP, she was currently more than 90 days delinquent \non any debt. Applicant asserted she should have paid closer attention to the completion \nof the e-QIP. She also asserted she did not intentionally and willfully falsify her answers \nto the e-QIP. (Tr. 65, 67) In the 39 years Applicant has held a clearance, she has \ncompleted a reinvestigation every five to six years, some times with an accompanying \nlifestyle polygraph.  \n \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant asserted the $23,000 judgment by an \nindividual was not her debt, but her husband\u2019s debt; that there was no judgment by the \nhome owner\u2019s association listed on her credit report; and she denied a tax lien had been \nentered against her. Her response asserted the omissions from her e-QIP were \ninadvertent and not deliberate. She asserted she thought the bankruptcy procedure had \nbeen started, but was never finished. (Tr. 54) She did not think of the bankruptcy as \nhaving been filed because it was not completed. (Tr. 54) She also asserted she was \nunder the impression that she did not owe any taxes and could file at any time.  \n \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant was interviewed and asked about her failure to file \ntaxes, the unpaid judgments, tax liens, and her responses to the e-QIP. When asked \nabout outstanding debts by the interviewer, Applicant volunteered she had not filed \ntaxes and the foreclosure. (Tr. 52, 115) In January 2007, Applicant stated she was \ngoing to obtain the services of a tax consultant and correct her failure to file. (Tr. 140) In \nFebruary 2008, Applicant stated in response to written interrogatories that she was still \nworking with a tax consultant to clear up her tax filings. (Ex 10)  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant presented copies of prepared state and federal income \ntax returns for years 1999 through 2007. (Ex. A \u2013 H, J - L) Applicant asserted she had \nnot had an opportunity to review the submitted tax returns. (Tr. 131, 132) No state \nreturn was provided for 1998. On December 10, 2008, following the hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted evidence she had filed Federal tax returns for tax years 1998 through and \nincluding 2007. (Ex. M) The forms are stamped as received by the Internal Revenue \nService December 4, 2008, the day after the second hearing. She also submitted \nevidence her state tax returns were filed for tax years 1998 through and including tax \nyear 2007. Her state returns were stamped received by the state revenue administration \ndivision and dated received December 4, 2008. (Ex. M) The material submitted \nconsisted only of the date stamped first page of each federal and state income tax \nreturn.  \n \n \n \n4\n\n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant presented copies of her state income tax returns for \n1999 through 2007 and her federal returns from 1998 through 2007. Applicant had \n$231,000 in federal tax withheld from her wages between 1998 and 2007. She had \n$48,000 in state tax withheld. The amounts were for the following years: for 1998, \n$6,757 federal and no state return (Ex K); for 1999, $5,840 federal and $3,965 state (Ex \nI, J); for 2000, $6,492 federal and $4,245 state (Ex I, H,,L); for 2001, $10,434 federal \nand $4,289 state (Ex I, H); for 2002, $26,039 federal and $0 state (Ex F); for 2003, \n$28,413 federal and $0 state (Ex E); for 2004, $36,342 federal and $11,718 state (Ex \nD); for 2005, $36,703 federal and $0 state (Ex C); for 2006, $37,586 federal and \n$12,320 state (Ex I, B); and, for 2007, $36,530 federal and $12,020 state (Ex I, A). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s state returns indicate she would receive a small refunds in 1999 \n($379) and 2000 ($343). According to her calculations, she owed $44,387 in past due \nstate taxes. The amount represents: 2001 ($1,621), 2002 ($10,506), 2003 ($12,977), \n2004 ($2,229), 2005 ($14,997), 2006 ($906), and 2007 ($1,151). These amounts \nrepresent taxes owed less amounts withheld on Applicant\u2019s behalf from her pay checks.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s calculations indicated three years of federal income tax refunds: 1998 \n($1,655), 2006 ($4,462), and 2007 ($738). She owed $23,244 in past due federal taxes. \nThe amount represents 1999 ($218), 2000 ($496), 2001 ($1,997), 2002 ($4,013), 2003 \n($7,564), 2004 ($3,902), and 2005 ($5,054). These amounts represent taxes owed less \namounts withheld from Applicant\u2019s bi-weekly pay checks. According to her calculations, \nApplicant owes $67,631 in state and federal back taxes. Her calculations do not account \nfor past due interest or penalties. Applicant asserted, but provided no supporting \ndocumentation, that she had the ability to immediately pay $60,000 in past due taxes, \nbut would not be able to immediately pay $100,000 for past due taxes. (Tr. 138)  \n \n \nFiling of the returns stops the accumulations of additional penalties for failing to \nfile, but does not impact on interest, which will continue to accrue until the taxes are \npaid. Once filed, Applicant intends to submit amended returns when more accurate \ninformation is known as to the amounts of state tax withheld. (Tr. 151)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n \n \n \n5\n\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \n \n6\n\n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit report, her \ninterview by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, her SOR \nresponse, her response to interrogatories, and her testimony. Applicant failed to file her \ntaxes for ten years. Applicant, according to her calculations, owes in excess of $60,000 \nin back taxes. In 2003, she had tax returns prepared, but failed to submit them. In 2007, \nshe stated she would obtain a tax consultant to submit her returns. She made a similar \nclaim in February 2008. At the first hearing, she had yet to submit the returns. The \nreturns were not submitted until after the second hearing. She has yet to pay her tax or \neither of the two judgments entered against her in 2000. She has provided insufficient \ndocumentation to show significant progress resolving her debts. Disqualifying \nConditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \n \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n \n \n \n7\n\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Ten years of state and federal tax returns were not \ntimely filed. This is not infrequent conduct. The returns were filed after the second \nhearing and she has yet to make payment of her taxes. The last payment on either of \nthe two judgments occurred in 2001. Applicant\u2019s said she was negligent for failing to file \nher tax returns. Her recent filing is insufficient to find this is not behavior which was \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. It does cast doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nIn September 2001, Applicant separated from her husband. She has failed to \nshow how that event seven years ago impacts on her current finances or her ability to \nfile her returns. Applicant asserted she had enough funds to pay $60,000 in back taxes. \nShe did not address why she had not paid the $600 judgment or the other unpaid \njudgment. AG & 20(b) does not apply. \n \nThe federal and states taxes remain unpaid as does the two judgments. There is \nno evidence she has attended financial classes. There is no good-faith effort to repay \nthe overdue creditor or otherwise resolve the debts. Applicant stopped paying on the \n$23,000 judgment when she changed jobs and the garnishment ended. She made no \npayments since 2001. Neither AG & 20(c) nor & 20(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d \n \n \nUnder AG &16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d and AG &16(b) \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative,\u201d apply. \nApplicant=s false answers on her e-QIP concerning her unpaid judgments, unpaid taxes, \ntax lien, garnishment, and bankruptcy filings tend to show questionable judgment, \nunreliability, and a lack of trustworthiness. \n \n \n \n8\n\n \n \nThe November 2006 e-QIP, question 27, asked Applicant if during the prior \nseven years, which would have been since November 1999, she had any liens placed \nagainst her property for failing to pay taxes or other debts. She answered \u201cno.\u201d The \nstate filed a tax lien against her in 2002. Applicant asserts she was unaware of any tax \nliens and did not intentionally provide false information. Tax liens are routinely imposed \nonly after a person is notified of the tax obligations and provided an opportunity to \nrespond. Applicant knew she was delinquent on her state and federal taxes. She stated \nshe was receiving letters about her unpaid taxes, which she had read, and knew the tax \nauthority claimed she owed back taxes.  \n \n \nBankruptcy petitions were filed in June 2000 and April 2001 in an attempt to \nprevent the foreclosure of her home. Despite the clear language of the e-QIP, which \nasked if during the prior seven years she had filed a petition under any chapter of the \nbankruptcy code, she answered \u201cno.\u201d She asserts she answered this question as she \ndid because the bankruptcy, though started, was never finished. The question asks \nabout filings and not the about discharged debts or bankruptcies being dismissed. \n \n \nIn November 2000, a homeowners association obtained a $617 judgment against \nApplicant. The action had been filed in October 1999. The action was filed and \njudgment entered against her and her husband while they still occupied their home. \nForeclosure of the home occurred in late 2001.  \n \n \nApplicant was aware of the $23,000 judgment against her and a garnishment of \nher wages because money was taken from her pay check for approximately ten months \nbetween January 2001 and October 2001. She knew of the judgment because she hired \nan attorney to help her address the garnishment. When Applicant completed her e-QIP, \nshe was asked in question 27 if she had any unpaid judgments against her she failed to \nlist either of the unpaid judgments. \n \n \nApplicant had not filed taxes for ten years nor paid any past due tax. She was \nreceiving letters from tax authorities telling her she owed back taxes. When she \ncompleted her e-QIP she was asked in question 28 if she had ever been more than 180 \ndays delinquent on any debt or was currently delinquent on any debt. She was aware \nshe owed taxes.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for failings to list her bankruptcy filings, unpaid \njudgments, past due taxes, and garnishment are not credible. Her assertion that she \nwas not being deceptive is unpersuasive. Applicant knew she had not filed taxes for 10 \nyears and knew she was receiving letters stating she owed past due taxes. She knew of \nthe $23,000 unpaid judgment and garnishment. I find Applicant deliberately falsified her \nanswers to question 27 and 28 of the security clearance application.  \n \nUnder the Directive, an applicant may mitigate the security concerns arising from \nquestionable personal conduct under certain circumstances. AG \u00b617 provides \nconditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns, including AG \u00b6 17(a): \n \n \n \n9\n\n\u201cif a person provides the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d I find this \nmitigating factor does not apply. Applicant has not met her burden of proving that she \nmade good-faith efforts to correct the omissions in her security clearance application or \nthat her efforts were prompt. She completed her e-QIP in November 2006 and was \ninterviewed in January 2007. There is no evidence she volunteered any information \nbefore being questioned about her unpaid taxes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) provides mitigation where \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or \nfrom a source of questionable reliability.\u201d Applicant=s failure to pay taxes for ten years, \nfailure to list her bankruptcy filings, failure to list her unpaid judgments, and her \ngarnishment is information pertinent to a determination of her judgment, trustworthiness, \nand reliability. I find this mitigating factor does not apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) provides mitigation where \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The security clearance application in \nissue was executed in November 2006. The past due taxes and two judgments remain \nunpaid and are therefore considered recent. The available evidence shows Applicant \ngave five false answers on the security clearance application. This was not a single, \nisolated incident. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply. I also \nconsidered carefully the other potentially mitigating conditions and conclude they do not \napply.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a) states it may be disqualifying where there \u201ca single serious crime or \nmultiple lesser offenses.\u201d Similarly, AG \u00b6 31(c) provides \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted\u201d may be disqualifying. It is a misdemeanor to fail to file state \nand/or federal tax returns. Paragraph 3 of the SOR alleges Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \n' 1001 by deliberately making a materially false statement on her security clearance \napplication. For the reasons discussed above, I find Applicant deliberately made \nmaterially false statements on her SF 86 in violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1001.  \n \nSecurity concerns raised by criminal conduct may be mitigated under certain \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 32(a) provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns if \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The false statements at issue \n \n \n \n10\n\nwere made on the security clearance application that is presently before us and is \ntherefore recent. This mitigating condition does not apply. There was not showing her \nfailing to pay taxes was due to is unusual circumstance. Her failure started three years \nbefore she changed job. There is no showing her false answers were the result of \nunusual circumstances.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 32 (d), criminal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d Following the \nhearing, Applicant filed her state and federal tax returns. However, Applicant=s evidence \ndoes not convince me that there is Aclear evidence of successful rehabilitation.\u201d This \npotentially mitigating condition does not apply. The other potentially mitigating \nconditions were carefully considered and do not apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Failing to file tax returns and pay \nstate and federal income tax for ten years indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, \nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Failing to pay judgments and \nproviding false answers on a security questionnaire also indicates a lack of judgment or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. She stopped making payment on the \n$23,000 judgment when she changed jobs and the garnishment of her wages stopped. \nShe says she will pay this if she has to, but provided no evidence of having done so. \nShe asserts she has sufficient funs to pay $60,000 in back taxes, but failed to explain \nwhy she has not paid the $600 homeowner\u2019s judgment. She has known of this small \n \n \n \n11\n\n \n \n \n12\njudgment since at least April 2008 when she received the SOR and the debt remains \nunpaid. \n \nShe did not file her taxes until after her second hearing, which again supports her \nclaim that she will do so if she has to in order to keep her clearance. Ten years of \nunpaid taxes, bankruptcy filings, garnishment of one\u2019s wages, and unpaid judgments \nare a type of obligations an applicant is expected to remember and report on her e-QIP. \nAccording to her own calculations, she owes in excess of $60,000 in back taxes, which \nmakes no accounting for penalties and past due interest. She owes an additional \n$23,000 for an unpaid judgment. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Criminal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a \u2013 3.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nAugust 20, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on January 2, 2007.  On April 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on May 17, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on June 18, 2008.  It was later transferred and assigned to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on July 7, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nJuly 8, 2008, scheduling the hearing for August 6, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2.  The Applicant\npresented ten exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through J.  He also testified\non his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on August 14, 2008.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n\n2\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political condition in Bangladesh.  Applicant had\nno objection.  (Tr. p. 18).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted\ninto evidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set\nout in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 38 years of age, married and has a\nMaster\u2019s Degree in Communication Theory.  He is employed as an Electrical Engineer\nfor a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 1969.  He came to the United\nStates on an F-1 student visa in August 1991, to pursue a college degree.  He became\na naturalized United States citizen in February 2006.  In May or June 1997, he returned\nto Bangladesh to meet the woman he was arranged to marry, and returned to\nBangladesh later that year, in December 1997, to get married.  His wife came to the\nUnited States in 1997, and she became a naturalized citizen in 2005.  He began\nworking for his current employer in October 2006, completed a security clearance\napplication on January 2, 2007, wherein he indicated that he was a dual citizen of\nBangladesh and the United States.  (Government Exhibit 1, p. 8).  He updated his form\nlater to indicate his dual citizenship had expired along with his Bangladeshi passport.   \nThe Applicant\u2019s parents and in-laws are citizens and residents of Bangladesh.\nThe Applicant has traveled to Bangladesh two times  in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001,\n2002, 2004 and 2005.  His trips to Bangladesh to see his family from 1998 through 2000\nwere with the permission of his company.  In 2001, his trip was for business purposes\nonly.  His trips to Bangladesh in 2004 and 2005 were to visit his family there.  On most\nof his trips to Bangladesh his wife travels with him so that she can visit her parents there\ntoo. He plans to again travel to Bangladesh at the end of 2008 or the beginning of 2009.\nWhen the Applicant visits his family in Bangladesh he brings gifts of chocolates,\nsouvenirs, books and golf items for his father.  The Applicant also has a sister who is a\nfinancial analyst and resides in Canada.  \nHe considers himself \u201cclose\u201d to and maintains regular communication with, his\nmother, father and in-laws in Bangladesh.  He communicates with his mother and father\nabout once a week or every other week.  (Tr. p. 46).  His father is a retired Brigadier\nGeneral in the Bangladesh Army after twenty five or thirty years of service.  Growing up,\nthe Applicant\u2019s father never discussed his work with the Applicant so that Applicant is\n\n3\nnot aware of whether he is still affiliated with any military organization.  (Tr. p. 51).  He\ndoes know that he is now a newspaper journalist for the local paper in Bangladesh.        \n  \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a teacher or Vice Principal of a private school in\nBangladesh.  She is currently considering her options to relocate to the United States.\nSince the early part of 2008, when she separated from her husband, the Applicant has\nsent his mother-in-law approximately $300.00 a month to help provide for her support.\nThe Applicant speaks with his mother-in-law about once a month or so.  His wife speaks\nwith her mother more frequently, about a couple of times a week.  His father-in-law is a\nretired executive of an electric company and is supported by his properties.  He also\nserved in the Bangladesh military and was a Lieutenant Colonel and a civil engineer\nbefore he retired.  The Applicant\u2019s wife has one sister who lives in Canada but is\nspending the summer in Bangladesh.  She speaks to her a couple of times a week.  (Tr.\nP. 61).  Her brother is an artist who lives in Bangladesh.  \nThe Applicant has a small bank account in Bangladesh for purposes of\nexchanging money from the United States to Bangladesh.  (Tr. p. 62).\nThe Applicant does not own a home in the United States.  He owns a car and\nhas some money in retirement accounts worth approximately $120,000.00.  (Tr. p. 63).  \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Director of Human Resources\nand long time friend attest to his frequent relocations for his company, including\nMinnesota, Nebraska, and then travel abroad for his company to Australia and\nSingapore in mid 2001.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C, D, E and F).  \n      \nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in\nBangladesh.  Bangladesh obtained its independence from Pakistan in 1971 and\npursuant to its constitution of 1972, it became a parliamentary democracy.  Relations\nwith Bangladesh and the United States are excellent and Bangladesh has become a\nvaluable United States ally in the Global War on Terrorism.  However, its human rights\nrecord has worsened over the years.  Extra-judicial killings, arbitrary arrest and\ndetention, physical and psychological torture by security forces and politically motivated\nviolence has become more prevalent.  Although prohibited by law, security forces and\npolice have frequently employed severe treatment as well as psychological abuse\nduring arrests and interrogations.  The United States Department of State advises\nUnited States citizens against traveling to certain areas in Bangladesh because of the\nviolence from members of banned terrorist groups that surface in the area.  \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\n\n4\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \n7.  (d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\n\n5\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign connections may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the\nApplicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to\nthat of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nThe Applicant, on his security clearance application, initially indicated that he is a\ndual citizen of Bangladesh and the United States.  It is undisputed that he has\nsignificant family ties in Bangladesh, and there is strong evidence of a close bond and\naffection with his family in Bangladesh.  His mother, father, mother-in-law and father-in-\nlaw are all citizens of and reside in Bangladesh.  He maintains close and continuing\ncontact with them, that ranges from about once a week to about once a month\ndepending on who they are.  Although he has been in the United States since 1991, he\nonly became a United States citizen in 2006, just two years ago.  He has traveled to\nBangladesh extensively, and plans to go back again to visit his family in the near future.\nHe has not cut all ties from Bangladesh.    \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and 7(d) sharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion apply.  None of the mitigation conditions apply. \nIt is noted that the current political situation in Bangladesh elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  Although there is no direct evidence that his family members in\nBangladesh are associated in any way with the Bangladesh government, there is\nevidence of a close bond and strong evidence of affection with his immediate family in\nBangladesh. This bond and affection with his family could potentially cause the\nApplicant to become subject to foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.  Therefore, the possibility of foreign influence exists that could create the\npotential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified information.  I find that the\nApplicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant\nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.c.: Against the Applicant\n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

On June 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 18, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on June 24, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. DOHA received the request on July 8, 2008. I received the case assignment on \nAugust 27, 2008.  Thereafter, Applicant retained counsel who filed a Notice of \nAppearance and an Amended Answer on September 22, 2008.  DOHA issued a Notice \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 9, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nof Hearing on October 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nNovember 5, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through Y, without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 18, 2008 \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. at 12, 14.) The request and the attached documents \nwere admitted into evidence as Exhibit 4. The facts administratively noticed are set out \nin the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 24, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old.  He is unmarried.  Applicant works for a defense \ncontractor.  He was born in Iraq.  He is of the ethnic Kurdish heritage in Northern Iraq. \nHe graduated from an Iraqi college in 1981 with an electrical engineering degree.  He \nserved his mandatory military duty in the Iraqi Army from 1981 to 1983.  He had \ndifficulty getting a job after his military service because he is a Kurd and was not a \nmember of the ruling Ba\u2019athist Party.  In 1991, he fled Iraq along with his family and \nother persons from his hometown to escape possible attack by the previous Iraqi \nregime, and he went to a refugee camp in Turkey with his parents and sisters.  They \nreturned to Iraq when protected by United Nations coalition forces.  He preferred not to \nreturn to Iraq.  Applicant went to Turkey and applied for asylum in 1992, and sought to \ncome to the United States.  He was admitted as a refugee to the United States in 1992.  \nIn May 1999 he became a U.S. citizen.  Applicant owns his home.  He purchased it in \n2001 for about $98,000 and paid off the mortgage in 2005.  He also paid $86,000 in \ncash for seven lots next to his home. (Tr. 28-30, 43-49, 72; Exhibits 1-3, S-X) \n \n \nFrom March 2003 to 2004, Applicant worked for a defense contractor as a \ntranslator in Iraq with the United Nations coalition forces during the liberation of Iraq \nfrom the Saddam Hussein Ba\u2019athist Party regime.  He had an interim security clearance, \non which he had no violations.  He worked very hard and took a break to rest from 2004 \nuntil February 2006, when he signed a contract with another Government contractor to \nwork as a cultural advisor to the coalition forces in Iraq.  He has had an interim security \nclearance since starting work with the second defense contractor, and there have been \nno violations of that security clearance.  (Tr. 31-34, 51-54; Exhibits 1-3)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant has five sisters and two brothers, all of whom were born in Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and four sisters live in Iraq and are citizens of that country.   One \nbrother died in the refugee camp in 1991.  Another sister lives in Norway, as does an \nuncle whom Applicant has not had contact with since 1996. Of the four sisters living in \nIraq, the third oldest of them is engaged to an Iraqi-born man and they will be moving to \nGermany after their marriage.  His mother is 65 years old, and lives on the pension her \nhusband, who died in 1996, earned as a policeman in Iraq.  Applicant does not provide \nany financial support to her.  His four sisters are school teachers in Iraq.  The oldest \nsister is married to an electrician, the second oldest to an accountant, and the youngest \nis married to a real estate agent.  Applicant last spoke with his mother and sisters four \nmonths prior to the hearing.  He speaks with them by telephone two or three times each \nyear.  Applicant characterizes his relationship with his mother as a \u201clong distance\u201d \nsituation. Also, Applicant\u2019s two brothers live in European countries, the Netherlands and \nNorway.  Applicant testified his sisters and mother appreciate the United States efforts \nto bring democracy to Iraq, and does not regard himself as open to any coercion or \npressure because of his familial relationships. (Tr. 37-41, 47, 50, 58-68; Exhibits 1-3) \n \n \nSince leaving Iraq, Applicant has not had much physical contact with his family.  \nHe visited them for a month at a time in 1999 and 2005, staying at his mother\u2019s house.  \nWhile there in those years, he visited a childhood friend.  He has not had contact with \nthat person since 2005.  He used his U.S. passport each time to enter Iraq and any \nother country on route to that destination.  Since becoming a U.S. citizen in 1999, \nApplicant has not voted in any Iraqi election, and prior to that the elections in Iraq were \ncontrolled by the Hussein regime.  Applicant does not own any property in Iraq or any \nother foreign country.  He has not had any contact with the Iraqi Embassy in the United \nStates.  He has no plans to visit Iraq on personal business as he did in 1999 and 2005.  \nApplicant does not claim dual citizenship with Iraq, contending he renounced his Iraqi \ncitizenship when he became a U.S. citizen.  He is willing to renounce any vestige of \nIraqi citizenship if it were found to exist currently. (Tr. 69, 70) \n \n \nApplicant submitted 12 very favorable character letters from persons with whom \nhe worked in Iraqi, including military members with whom he served and U.S. \nDepartment of State infrastructure reconstruction team leaders. They all reported \nexcellent work by Applicant, the long hours he worked, his dedication to his duty and to \nthe efforts being made in Iraq by the coalition forces, and recommended he receive a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant also submitted several certificates awarded him by the \ncoalition military forces for his duty performance.  His performance evaluations for 2008, \nsubmitted as exhibits, are marked as \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d in his duty performance.  \nApplicant also submitted his financial records to show his real estate purchases, his \nsavings and investments, all directed toward showing his financial investment in the \nUnited States. (Exhibits A-Y)     \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Iraq is a Middle Eastern country \nwith 27 million people.  In 2003, The United States led a United Nations coalition to \nremove Saddam Hussein, a long-serving dictator and Ba\u2019athist Party leader, from power \nin Iraq. A parliamentary democracy was created pursuant to a new 2005 constitution. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAfter free elections in 2006, Iraq\u2019s new government took office. The Parliament was \nelected for a four year term. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq has had \nmuch violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous \nattacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other \ncivilians, as well as Iraqis.  Although the new governmental has taken aggressive action \nagainst terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high, as do human rights \nabuses. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as state \nintelligence services.  For the past 18 months, the large increase in U.S. combat troops \nin Iraq has substantially reduced violence. These troops were aided by Iraqi soldiers of \nthe new Iraqi Government, and Sunni local forces that formerly supported the Al Qaeda \ninsurrection.  In Northern Iraq, the Kurdish local government and forces maintain a more \npeaceful environment for the residents than elsewhere in Iraq.  The Iraqi Government \nhas regained sovereignty over its territory, has primary responsibility for security, and \nthe coalition, primarily American military forces now, operate according to a recently \nconcluded status of forces agreement between the United States and Iraq. (Exhibit 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interest, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n \n \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mothers and four sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. While Iraq \nstruggles with the creation of a democracy, it is randomly victimized by terrorist attacks. \nThis situation creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6 \u00b6 \n7(a) and (b) have been raised by the evidence. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation.  Two conditions that could mitigate the disqualifications are provided under \nAG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interests. In 1991, Applicant escaped from Iraq to avoid the Hussein \nregime.  He sought asylum and came then to the United States in 1992.  He became a \nnaturalized citizen in 1999.  He worked in the United States since his arrival, does not \nown any property in Iraq, but owns a home and has his money in the United States. He \nreturned to Iraq in 2003 to work with the United Nations coalition forces in removing the \ndictatorial regime then in power.  He departed in 2004 after concluding his work with the \nfirst defense contractor for whom he worked.  He visited his family in 1999 and 2005.  \nHe returned to work in Iraq with another defense contractor as a cultural advisor in \n2006.  He continued to do that job until his interim security clearance was removed in \n2008 when the SOR was issued.  He speaks to his mother and four sisters two or three \ntimes a year by telephone.  He has not seen his mother or sisters since 2005.  One \nother sister and his two brothers live in Europe.  His ties to the United States are much \nstronger than his ties to his siblings and elderly mother living in Iraq. His strongly \nexpressed gratitude to the United States for giving him shelter and a peaceful life is very \npersuasive to show his strong ties to the United States overcoming any residual \nattraction to his former country.  In his former country he was a member of a \ndiscriminated minority who had limited job opportunities.  He wanted to come to the \nUnited States in 1992 and escape the situation in Iraq.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) has limited application to Applicant\u2019s relationships with his siblings, \nwith whom he has infrequent communication. Although there is a remote possibility that \nterrorists could attempt to coerce or threaten Applicant through his mother or siblings, it \nis highly unlikely. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Iraq. But they are declining as the new Government matures \nand gains experience.  More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are hostile to \nthe United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even friendly \ngovernments, could attempt to use his sisters and mother, who live in Iraq, to obtain \nsuch information. Second, he had connections to Iraq before he left there in 1991. He \nwas born in Iraq and spent his formative years there. Third, his mother and four sisters \nremain citizens and residents of Iraq. Fourth, he maintains some contact with his mother \nand sisters. \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. Applicant is a mature person. He came to the United States as a refugee in \n\n \n8 \n \n \n1992 and became a naturalized citizen in 1999.  He has worked in the United States \nsince his arrival.  He previously owned property in the United States, and currently has \na bank account. Out of his sense of gratitude and dedication to the United States, he \nsought employment with a Government contractor in 2003 as an Arabic-speaking \nlinguist. He takes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and has worked \ndiligently for a defense contractor for more than two years in an important capacity for \nour troops. I give great weight to the letters of recommendation, written by the soldiers \nwith whom he served. They assess him as loyal and trustworthy, and praise his \nsignificant contributions to the cause of freedom in Iraq. After leaving Iraq in 1991, he \ndid not return for 8 years. No statements from his character witnesses recommended \ndenial of his security clearance. There is no evidence that he has ever taken any action \nthat could cause potential harm to the United States or failed to abide by his employer\u2019s \nrules and regulations.  \n \nApplicant held an interim security clearance during his tenure in Iraq without any \nindication that he breached security policies or procedures. While that fact is not \nnormally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the nation security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognizes, resist, \nand report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 4)  On April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines H (Drug Involvement). (Item 1)  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 12, 2008.

(Item 4 at 25) \n \n \nApplicant admitted in an interview with security investigators on September 4, \n2007, that he used marijuana a total of four times from June 2005 until May 2007.  On \neach occasion he was with friends at social gatherings and he took two or three puffs \nfrom a marijuana cigarette that was being shared.

He tested positive in June 2007 \nfor marijuana when tested by his new employer.  His last use of marijuana had been a \nfew weeks prior to the test.  He agreed to random future tests to maintain his position \nwith the defense contractor.  He has no future intention to use marijuana or any other \nillegal drug. (Item 5 at 3) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised Administrative Guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering \nsubstances, and include those listed on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  \nMarijuana is listed as a drug in the Controlled Substance Act of 1970.  Drug abuse is \nthe illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from \napproved medical direction. (AG \u00b6 24)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admits to using marijuana four times from June 2005 until May 2007.  \nHe also tested positive for marijuana in June 2007.  His drug use and positive test for \nmarijuana raises Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug use); \nAG \u00b6 25(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use); and AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug \npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution).  Applicant had to possess the marijuana cigarette to use marijuana. \n \n \nI have considered the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC).  \nApplicant\u2019s last admitted use was in May 2007.  He voluntarily took three or four puffs of \na marijuana cigarette that was being passed around by friends at a social occasion.  DI \nMC AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  \nApplicant's used marijuana four times.  All of his use of marijuana was voluntary with his \nlast use only a little over a year ago.  This makes his use of marijuana recent, frequent, \nand not under unusual circumstances.  Since his use was voluntary and in a gathering \nof friends, it may likely recur.   \n \n \nI considered DI MC AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the \nfuture, such as; (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts: (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used: (3) an appropriate period \nof abstinence: (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation) does not apply.  Applicant stated he intents not to use marijuana in the \nfuture.  He has an agreement with his employer to be randomly tested for drug use.  \nHowever, a stated intent not to use drugs is not sufficient to mitigate admitted drug use.  \nAppellant has not presented information on any change of friends, environment, or \nsocial circumstances to indict he will not use drugs.  Only a little over a year has passed \nsince Applicant's last admitted use of marijuana.  He has not noted any counseling or \nrehabilitation programs for drug use.  The only aspect of the mitigating condition that is \napplicable is Appellant's agreement with his employer to be randomly tested for drug \nuse.  Applicant has not presented sufficient information to meet his heavy burden to \nmitigate his admitted use of marijuana.  Guideline H is decided against Applicant. \n \n \nThe Bond Amendment, 50 USC \u00a7 435b, prohibits all Federal agencies from \ngranting or renewing a security clearance for any person who is an unlawful user of a \ncontrolled substance or is an addict.  The Department of Defense (DoD) issued interim \nguidance defining an unlawful user of a controlled substance as \"a person who uses a \ncontrolled substance and has lost the power of self-control with reference to the use of \nthe controlled substance, and any person who is a current user of the controlled \nsubstance in a manner other than as prescribed by a licensed physician.\"  Such use is \nnot limited to the use of drugs on a particular day, or within a matter of days or weeks \nbefore, rather that the unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the \nindividual is actively engaged in such conduct.  An \"addict\" of a controlled substance is \ndefined as \"an individual who habitually uses any narcotic drug so as to endanger the \npublic morals, health, safety, or welfare; or is so far addicted to the use of narcotic drugs \nas to have lost the power of self-control with reference to his addiction. (Memorandum, \nSubject: Interim Guidance for the Implementation of Public Law 110-181, Section 3002 \n\n \n5 \n \n(the Bond Amendment) Regarding Adjudication of Security Clearances, date June 20, \n2008).  Applicant used marijuana four times, his last use being in May 2007.  Since his \nlast use was over a year ago, there is no indication that he has lost self-control over the \nuse of the drug or that he habitually uses the drug.  Applicant's use of marijuana does \nnot rise to the level of a person prohibited from being granted a security clearance \nunder the provisions of the Bond Amendment.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant is only \n20 years old and experimented with marijuana while a high school student and shortly \nthereafter.  I considered that his last use was over a year ago, that he stated his intent \nnot to use illegal drugs in the future, and agreed to random drug testing by his \nemployer.  A stated intention to not use drugs in the future is not sufficient by itself to \novercome admitted voluntary use of drugs in the past. He has not provided sufficient \ninformation to mitigate the security concern based on his use of marijuana.  He has not \nindicated he has changed friends or social environment that led to his use of drugs.  He \nhas not received counseling for drug use or participated in any rehabilitation programs.  \nHe agreed over a year ago to random testing for drug use.  He has not indicated \nwhether he has been tested and that the results were negative.  Sufficient time has not \npassed since his last voluntary use of marijuana to indicate he will not use drugs in the \nfuture.  Applicant has failed to provide sufficient information to mitigate security \nconcerns for his drug use and positive random test for marijuana.  Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present and future \nabuse of drugs and his lack of good judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations.  He has not established that he is suitable for \na security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his abuse of marijuana.  \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 13, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant seeks reversal of the Judge\u2019s adverse decision arguing that the record evidence\nshows that he is not financially overextended.  As part of his submission on appeal, he includes\ncopies of several of the exhibits admitted into the record at the hearing as well as a detailed\nexplanation of his financial circumstances.  Applicant\u2019s presentation  does not demonstrate that the\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as\na whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice\nversa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 09-04354 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2010).\nIn this case, the Judge found against Applicant under Guideline F as to three significant\ndebts\u2014a loan account relating to an automobile that had been repossessed and two mortgages on\nproperty that had been foreclosed upon.  On the day of the hearing, Applicant had reached an\nagreement with the creditor to begin payment of the delinquent auto loan account, but had not yet\nmade any payments in furtherance thereof.  Moreover, he still owed a deficiency of approximately\n$100,000 which occurred when he failed to make payments on two mortgages, and the property\nsecuring the mortgages was foreclosed on and sold in 2007.  In reaching her adverse decision, the\nJudge noted that Applicant\u2019s unresolved financial delinquencies did not appear to be the result of\na situation beyond his control, and he appeared to possess sufficient assets to satisfy his creditors.\nDecision at 9.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems were still ongoing.\nThe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant under Guideline E and with respect to two\nof the SOR factual allegations under Guideline F, but reasonably explained why the mitigating\nevidence was insufficient to overcome all of the government\u2019s security concerns.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes\nthat the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\n\n3\nMfrs.

His \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 14, 2007, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On July 7, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 27, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \ndecision on the record in lieu of a hearing.

The case was assigned to me on August 20, 2010. Applicant was \noverseas on business travel and was not available for a hearing until the first week of   \nNovember 2010. He and Department Counsel agreed that his hearing would be held \nNovember 1, 2010. The hearing was held, as scheduled, to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced 10 exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 10 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant \ntestified and called no witnesses. He offered five exhibits, which were marked as Ex. A \nthrough E and admitted without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, at \nApplicant\u2019s request, I left the record open for one week, until close of business \nNovember 8, 2010, so that he could provide additional information for the record. \nApplicant timely submitted two additional exhibits, which were marked as Ex.

Applicant received the notice \nof hearing when he returned from overseas travel approximately five days before his \nhearing. However, he stated at his hearing that he had known about the hearing \u201ctwo or \nthree weeks ago.\u201d He was apprised of subsection E3.1.8. of Enclosure 3 of the \nDirective, which states that an \u201capplicant shall be notified at least 15 days in advance of \nthe time and place of hearing. . . .\u201d I discussed the issues of notice and waiver with \nApplicant.

Additionally, he pays approximately $2,400 in taxes on the property \nevery six months. In his two financial statements, Applicant claims the house as an \nasset worth $450,000. (Ex. 1; Ex. 2 at 7; Ex. 4 at 4-5; Tr. 64-65, 71-72, 90-92.) \n \n \nAs a government contractor, Applicant has been assigned to work for a federal \nexecutive department for approximately 19 years. His work has taken him to over 30 \ncountries. His overseas assignments usually last from two weeks to three months. \nWhen his employer has no assignments for him and he remains in the United States, he \nreceives approximately $800 a month in \u201cstates pay.\u201d (Ex. 2 at 8; Tr. 69-70, 76, 84-85.) \n \n \nApplicant estimated that his yearly income was approximately $60,000 to \n$70,000. He admitted several financial delinquencies in his Answer to the SOR. His \ncredit reports reflect that he purchased an automobile on credit in September 2005.  \nThe date of last activity on the account was January 2006. The SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.a. \nthat a delinquency of approximately $10,560 had been charged off and remained \nunpaid as of July 2010. In supplementary information attached to his Answer to the \nSOR and in his personal subject interview, Applicant identified the debt as an \nautomobile repossession which occurred in March 2006. In an affidavit signed on March \n8, 2010, Applicant acknowledged the debt. He stated that he was not aware of the debt \nbecause the debtor contacted him at an old address. As a post-hearing submission, \nApplicant provided a copy of a letter, dated November 1, 2010, from the creditor\u2019s agent \nreporting that the delinquent debt had increased to approximately $19,762. The agent \nfurther acknowledged that Applicant had agreed to a payment plan, beginning on \nNovember 8, 2010, whereby Applicant would remit $200 a month for a year. The \ncreditor further stated that Applicant\u2019s account would be reviewed in November 2011 to \ndetermine a payment increase on the account.  (Ex. 3 at 5; Ex. 6; Ex. 8; Ex. 9; Ex. 10; \nEx. A; Ex. G; Tr. 61, 73-74.) \n \n \n In May 2005, one of the friends Applicant made during his military service \ncontacted him for assistance. The friend and his wife were facing foreclosure of their \nhome. Because he felt close to the friend and thought of him as a brother, Applicant \nagreed to help him by purchasing the home, and his friend promised to make the \nmonthly payments to the mortgage lenders. Applicant took out two mortgages on the \nproperty. The first mortgage was for $406,000, with a monthly mortgage payment of \napproximately $3,000 a month. The second mortgage was for $101,000, with a monthly \npayment of approximately $1,200. (SOR; Ex. 8; Ex. 4 at 1; Ex. E at 1; Tr. 39.) \n \n \nApplicant was working overseas when the friend contacted him. In order to \ncomplete the transaction necessary for him to purchase the property and assume the \ntwo mortgages, Applicant requested unscheduled leave to return to the United States. \n \n2 When asked if he owned his grandmother\u2019s house in the city where he lives, Applicant replied: \u201cIt\u2019s my \nfamily house, the house I grew up in so it\u2019s pretty much everybody\u2019s house, you know, just the house I \nlive in now.\u201d (Tr. 72.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHis supervisor tried to persuade Applicant not to leave his work site overseas. Applicant \npersisted, and the supervisor allowed Applicant to return to the United States. (Tr. 56.) \n \n \nApplicant then returned to the United States to complete the transaction \nnecessary to purchase the house from his friend. However, the process took longer \nthan he had anticipated, and his return to his job location overseas was delayed. He told \nhis supervisor of the delay. Then, he missed his flight back. When he informed his \nsupervisor that he would be further delayed because he had missed his flight, the \nsupervisor told him he was being replaced and his replacement was already on the job \nin the foreign country. (Tr. 57.) \n \n \nApplicant remained at his home in the United States for an additional two days. \nHe then flew overseas to his job site to pick up his belongings. When he arrived there, \nhe found that his replacement, a co-worker, had been assigned to take his place and \narrived at the job site on the same day as he did. He concluded that the supervisor lied \nto him about his replacement being already on the job. He decided he did not want to \nwork for the company any longer. He sought other employment. The employer reported \nin a business record that Applicant had been terminated from his position for failure to \nreport for duty. (Ex. 7; Ex. E; Tr. 44-47, 56-57.)   \n \n \nA few months passed, and Applicant received notice that his friend had fallen \nbehind in making monthly payments on the two mortgages. Applicant contacted his \nfriend, who explained that he and his wife had some financial problems but would make \nup the late payments. However, the friend fell behind again in paying the mortgages. As \nthe owner of the property, Applicant received notice that the mortgage holders were \nseeking foreclosure. Applicant hired an attorney and began an eviction action against \nhis friend. After the friend and his family vacated the property, Applicant made \nnecessary repairs and listed the property for sale. However, the property went into \nforeclosure. The property sold for approximately $396,000 after foreclosure in 2007. \nThe SOR alleges at \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant was responsible for a past due amount on the \nfirst mortgage of $4,364, that the total amount of the loan balance at foreclosure was \n$399,602, and that the debt remained unpaid. The SOR alleges at \u00b6 1.c. that Applicant \nwas more than 120 days past due on the second mortgage debt of $101,377, and as of \nthe date of the SOR, the debt remained unsatisfied. (SOR; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Tr. 77-78.) \n \n \nApplicant is responsible for approximately $100,000 in unpaid debt related to the \nforeclosure and sale of the property. Neither Applicant nor his attorney has contacted \nthe mortgage holders to ascertain whether they are seeking a deficiency judgment \nagainst him for the unsatisfied mortgage debt.  Applicant reported that his attorney told \nhim he should be prepared to pay the deficiency if the mortgage holders demanded it. \nApplicant stated that if the mortgage holders approached him with a payment demand, \nhe would pay it. (Tr. 78-80.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.e. that Applicant owed a $1,906 debt, in collection status, \nto a cell phone company. In an affidavit, Applicant admitted the debt, which he had \nsettled for $762.72 in September 2009. He further stated that the debt had been \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \ndelinquent for about two years before he settled it. As a post-hearing document, he \nprovided a letter from a successor creditor in response to his dispute of the debt. The \nsuccessor creditor stated that the account had been closed, and it would take no further \ncollection action. The successor creditor also advised Applicant that it would provide \nthis information to the credit reporting agencies. (Ex. 4 at 3; Ex. F; Tr. 80-82.) \n \n \nApplicant reported a total net income of approximately $4,400 a month when he \nis assigned overseas.3 In a financial statement prepared on December 22, 2009, he \nreported $1,415 in monthly expenses, divided as follows: groceries: $300; clothing: \n$150; utilities: $200; life and other insurance: $115; medical: $50; child support: $400; \nand miscellaneous: $200. He reported monthly debts as follows: $600 on the \napproximately $3,000 remaining on the home loan he assumed after his grandmother\u2019s \ndeath; one credit card payment of $40 on a total debt of $250, and a second credit card \npayment of $150 on a total debt of $5,000. Applicant\u2019s monthly debt payments total \n$790. With these calculations, it would appear that Applicant has a monthly remainder \nof $2,195.4 (Ex. 2 at 8.) \n \n \nIn a financial statement prepared in conjunction with an affidavit he signed on \nDecember 17, 2009, Applicant reported an annual income of $60,000 to $70,000. He \nlisted total debts and expenses each month of $1,900. He listed the following assets: \n401K account: $20,000; checking account: $300; savings account: $1,000; and home: \n$450,000. (Ex. 4 at 5.)  \n \n \nIn his December 23, 2009, financial statement, Applicant listed the following \nassets: real estate: $450,000; bank savings: $2,000; and stock/bonds: $10,000. \nApplicant has not had financial counseling.  (Ex. 2 at 8; Ex. 4 at 5.) \n \n \nApplicant completed an e-QIP on March 14, 2007. Section 22 on the e-QIP \nasked the following questions about Applicant\u2019s employment record: \n \n \nHas any of the following happened to you in the last 7 years: \n \n \n \n1. Fired from a job. \n \n \n2. Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired. \n \n \n3. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct? \n \n \n3 It is unclear if the $4,400 figure is gross or net pay. Applicant provided the following explanatory \nstatement: \u201cMy take home pay [varies] because I\u2019m a contractor[,] so when I\u2019m overseas my pay is about \n$4400 monthly. Sometimes when I\u2019m out for a month or so, most of the time it\u2019s just for a month maybe \nlonger, but not often. When I\u2019m home in the states I get states pay in which it\u2019s about $400 dollars every 2 \nweeks, $800 monthly.\u201d  His financial statements do not show deductions from gross pay. (Ex. 2 at 8.) \n \n4 Applicant acknowledged that his income was not regular, and he needed to save money to support \nhimself between assignments. (Ex.4 at 4.) \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n4. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory \n           performance? \n \n \n5. Left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances? \n \nApplicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to each of the five questions in Section 22. (Ex. 1 at 23; Tr. \n85-88.) \n \n \nApplicant stated that in 1990, he had been fired from a job as a policeman and \nhad revealed that information on a security clearance application that he had filed \nafterwards. After an investigation in 1991, he was awarded a security clearance. \n \n \nIn an affidavit he signed on December 17, 2009, Applicant stated: \n \nWhile [in an overseas country] I requested leave to return to the US for \npersonal reasons. I was granted the leave, but when I was ready to return, \nI was told that they had already replaced me on that assignment and that I \nwould need to wait for another travel opportunity to deploy. (At this \ncompany, we were not salaried and received pay when sent to various \noverseas assignments.) \n \n(Ex. 5 at 5.) \n \n \nApplicant stated in his affidavit that he was not informed by the employer that he \nhad been terminated, and he did not resign. In a colloquy with Department Counsel, he \nstated that if he were to answer Question 5 in Section 22 again, he would answer \u201cYes.\u201d \nQuestion 5 in Section 22 asks if an applicant has \u201c[l]eft a job for other reasons under \nunfavorable conditions.\u201d He stated he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the five questions in Section 22 \nbecause he believed he had not been fired, and he did not read the four other   \nquestions in Section 22 carefully before responding. The SOR at \u00b6 2.a. alleged that \nApplicant\u2019s failure to list that he was terminated from a job in July 2005 was deliberate. \n(Ex. 5 at 5; Tr. 66-69, 88.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                         Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is set out in \nAG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline specifies two security concerns applicable in this case. Under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly \nunder AG \u00b6 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns. Applicant allowed old debt resulting from an automobile repossession in 2006 \nto accumulate and to remain unsatisfied. He provided documentation showing that, as \nof November 1, 2010, he had an agreement to pay the creditor $200 a month on the \ndebt, but as of the date of his hearing, he had not yet made any payments. As the result \nof the property foreclosure in 2007, he is potentially responsible for a $100,000 \ndeficiency. However, while he stated that he would pay the delinquency debt in \nresponse to a demand from the creditor, he has taken no action to inquire if he owes a \ndeficiency. The figures he provided suggest he has a monthly remainder of $2,195. This \nevidence is sufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions identified at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c). \n \nGuideline F enumerates conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions could apply to the \nsecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. Unresolved financial \ndelinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. (AG \u00b6 20(a)) \nAdditionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, such as loss \nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n(AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might be applicable include \nevidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 \n20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d)) Finally, security concerns related to financial \ndelinquencies might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (e)). \n \nThe Government withdrew the allegation at SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant provided \ndocumentation to corroborate his statement that he had disputed the debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.e., and the successor creditor responded and acknowledged that he no longer \nowed the debt.  Accordingly, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.e. are concluded for Applicant. \n \nHowever, the three remaining delinquencies alleged on the SOR continue to \nraise security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial delinquency which dates to \nat least 2006, when an automobile he had purchased was repossessed. Between 2006 \nand 2010, Applicant made no payments on the delinquent debt, which grew from the \n$10,560 alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. to $19,761. While he reached an agreement with the \ncreditor on November 1, 2010, to begin payment of the delinquent deficiency debt, he \nhad made no payments on the debt as of the date of his hearing. Moreover, he owes a \ndeficiency which occurred when he failed to make payments on the two mortgages \nsecuring the property he purchased for his friend, and the property was foreclosed upon \nand sold in 2007. While Applicant acknowledged he owed a deficiency of approximately \n$100,000 on the property, he has taken no action to contact the creditor. He stated he \nwould pay the debt if the creditor came to him with a demand for payment. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial statements suggest he possesses sufficient assets to satisfy these two \ncreditors. His unresolved financial delinquencies do not appear to be the result of a \nsituation beyond his control. \n \nApplicant purchased a home to help a friend in financial distress. However, \nneither he nor the friend possessed sufficient income to pay the two mortgages on the \nproperty, and the property fell into foreclosure. While Applicant provided documentation \nto corroborate that he had paid the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e., his effort to resolve the \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. was recent. He failed to show a track record of resolving the \ndebt, which had existed since 2006. While he merits partial credit for resolving the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e., he has not addressed the approximately $100,000 debt that \noccurred from the foreclosure and sale of the home he had purchased for his friend. He \nhas not had financial counseling. Overall, Applicant did not appear to be attentive to his \nfinancial obligations or to have a clear plan for resolving them. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) do not fully apply in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. I \nalso conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6  20(d) and 20(e) apply in partial mitigation to the facts of this \ncase. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n10 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and certified his e-QIP in March 2007, he answered \n\u201cNo\u201d in response to Question 1 on Section 22, and he failed to report that he had left \nemployment in March 2005 under unfavorable circumstances. At his hearing, he \nrecounted that his employer informed him that he had been replaced in his overseas \nassignment by another employee. When questioned about his state of mind at the time, \nApplicant recalled that he did not interpret his employer\u2019s statement to mean that he had \nbeen fired. He did acknowledge that he should have responded \u201cYes\u201d to Question 5 in \nSection 22 which asked if he had left a job for other reasons under unfavorable \ncircumstances.  \n \nThe Guideline E allegation in the SOR raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 \n16(a). AG \u00b6 16(a) reads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.a, which alleged deliberate falsification and failure to \nreport that he had been fired from a job in May 2005. DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has \ncogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing \nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to \nconclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under \nGuideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to \npresent evidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)).  \n \n \nSeveral Guideline mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a) if \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d If \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, \nomission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \ninadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security process\u201d and \u201c[u]pon being made aware of \nthe requirement to cooperate or provide information, the individual cooperated fully and \n\n \n11 \n \n \ncompletely,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(c) might apply. If \u201cthe \ninformation was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability,\u201d AG 17(f) \nmight apply.  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has, in the course of his employment in the \nmilitary and as a government contractor, completed several security clearance \napplications. When he was fired from a job in 1991, he reported it on a security \nclearance application he filed shortly thereafter. He denied that he deliberately and \nwillfully falsified his answer to Question 1 of Section 22 on the e-QIP he signed in March \n2007.  \n \nI thoroughly reviewed the documentary and testamentary evidence in this case. I \nobserved Applicant carefully, and I noted his demeanor and how he responded to \nquestions about answering Question 1 in Section 22 of his e-QIP. I also listened \ncarefully to his responses to questions posed during his security clearance hearing in \norder to assess his credibility and state of mind. I conclude while AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b) \ndo not apply, AG \u00b6 \u00b6 17(c) and 17(f) have some applicability in mitigation in Applicant\u2019s \ncase. The terms of Applicant\u2019s employment were unusual, and his employer\u2019s \ncommunications with Applicant over his employment status were ambiguous. He was \nnot told directly that he was fired. He did not carefully read the other questions about \nleaving employment under unfavorable conditions. When he answered \u201cNo,\u201d he was \nstating he had not been fired. I conclude, therefore, that there is insufficient record \nevidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d response to Question 1 in Section 22 and his \nfailure to list that he had been fired from a job in July 2005 for failure to report for duty \nwas a willful and deliberate falsification. Applicant did not intend to deceive the \nGovernment.  Accordingly, I conclude SOR \u00b6 2.a. for Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his or her \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant, a mature adult, assumed \nliability for considerable debt to help a friend in financial distress who was in danger of \nlosing his home. He did so without financial counseling. When the friend was unable to \ntimely pay the mortgages that Applicant assumed, Applicant lacked sufficient resources \nto pay them himself. Applicant is indebted for approximately $100,000 resulting from the \nforeclosure and sale of the property in 2007. However, while Applicant stated that he \nwould pay the debt if the creditor demanded he do so, he has taken no action to clarify \nhis responsibility for this debt. Additionally, at the time of his hearing, Applicant set up a \npayment plan for a debt he had owed since 2006, but he had not established a record of \npayment on the debt because he had not made the first payment under the plan. Thus, \nsignificant delinquent debts alleged on the SOR remain unresolved by Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to timely address his long-term financial delinquencies.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude that while Applicant\u2019s personal conduct was mitigated, he failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e.: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:             \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n           For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \n \n \n                           Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n___________________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(EQIP) on May 31, 2007. On September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 20, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn October 13, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December \n15, 2008. I convened a hearing on January 21, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.  The Government called no witnesses and introduced eight exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 8 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, called one witness, and introduced 17 exhibits, which were \nmarked Exs. A through Q. Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record without \nobjection.  \n \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on January 28, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG H, Drug \nInvolvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.) and three allegations of disqualifying conduct \nunder AG G, Alcohol Consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted the five Guideline H allegations and two of the three Guideline G \nallegations. He also provided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nadmitted as findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 23 years old and single. In May 2008, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin mechanical engineering. From approximately August 2003 until July 2007, Applicant \nworked intermittently as an intern for a defense contractor during summers and \nacademic breaks. In his employment as an intern, he did not hold a security clearance \nbut worked in program areas of military significance. Additionally, in August 2003, when \nhe began work as an intern for his employer, Applicant agreed to be bound by the \nemployer\u2019s code of business conduct and ethics, including its drug-free workplace \npolicy, which applied to all full-time and part-time employees. (Ex. 1; Ex. 8; Tr. 78-84.) \n \n \nDuring his senior year in college, from August 2007 until May 2008, Applicant \nworked on a research team at his university to redesign a landing gear for an unmanned \naircraft. The sponsor of the research project was the defense contracting firm which \nemployed him as an intern and which currently employs him. When he graduated from \ncollege, the defense contracting firm hired him as a program specialist. At the time of \nhis hearing, Applicant had worked full-time for the defense contractor since June 2008.  \nHe seeks a security clearance.  (Ex. G; Tr. 112, 131.) \n \n \nApplicant began using and experimenting with illegal drugs when he was 15 \nyears old. Between November 2001 and January 2007, he used marijuana 150 times. \nBetween the ages of 16 and 18, he used marijuana two times a week. In December \n2002, when he was about 17 years old, he used \u201cmushrooms.\u201d In March 2003, \nApplicant\u2019s parents suspected he was using illegal drugs. They took him to a drug \nrehabilitation center to be tested. He tested positive for marijuana use. Thereafter, he \nentered a drug and alcohol counseling class for adolescents that met two or three times \na week for two weeks. When he completed the drug and alcohol counseling program, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant said to himself: \u201cI need to stop, or at least severely limit my use.\u201d He remained \ndrug-free for one year. (Ex. 1; Tr. 64, 68, 88-89.) \n \n \nIn 2004, he used marijuana four times. He also used cocaine once in June 2004 \nafter graduating from high school. After he used cocaine, he felt guilty and remorseful. \nHe avoided the people with whom he used cocaine.  However, he used marijuana again \nin 2005, and, in December 2005, when he was about 20 years old, he used the \nprescription drug Adderall illegally. After his illegal use of Adderall, he resolved never to \nuse illegal drugs again. (Tr. 64-68, 86-87.) \n \n \nIn January 2007, when he was 21 years old, he traveled with a friend to a \nEuropean country and, while there, used marijuana twice. He thought his marijuana use \nwas legal in the European country. After his use of marijuana in January 2007, \nApplicant returned to his duties as an intern with his current employer. (Tr. 64-68, 83, \n85, 89.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents knew of his illegal use of marijuana in 2003.  After receiving \nthe SOR in the fall of 2008, he told them of his use of mushrooms in 2002 and his illegal \ndrug use since 2003. Applicant no longer has contact with the individuals with whom he \nused illegal drugs.  (Tr. 66, 90-92.)  \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol at the age of fifteen. Although his use of \nalcohol has impaired his judgment in the past, he is confident he knows how to use \nalcohol prudently and safely. In October 2007, he responded to questions from an \nauthorized investigator about his drinking habits. At that time, he stated that he drank \nalcohol about once a week and drank to intoxication about once a month. At his \nhearing, he stated he did not drink to intoxication as much as he did when he was in \ncollege.  He drank to intoxication at his college graduation in May 2008, at Thanksgiving \nin November 2008, and on New Year\u2019s Eve, 2008. He has not been diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or as alcohol dependent.  (Ex. 2 at 5; Tr. 96-100.) \n \n \nIn May 2006, when he was 20 years old, Applicant was in a bar. He was asked \nby a police officer to show his personal identification to establish that he was old enough \nto drink legally. Applicant presented the officer with an identification card that was not \nhis but which belonged to a person who was legally eligible to drink.  The officer cited \nhim for False Documentation. Applicant was fined and sentenced to 16 hours of \ncommunity service. (Ex. 6: Tr. 102-104.) \n \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant was arrested for underage drinking and charged \nwith Purchase/Possess Alcohol, a misdemeanor offense. He paid a fine and took a two-\nmonth alcohol safety awareness program from October 2007 to December 2007. He \nwas not permitted to drink alcohol during the alcohol safety awareness program. (Ex. 4; \nTr. 100-102,104-105.)      \n \n \nApplicant called a senior program manager from his employer to testify as a \nwitness on his behalf. The witness stated that he and Applicant were friends. He said he \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhad known Applicant personally and professionally for six months. He further stated that \nApplicant was honest, possessed an outstanding character, and was an excellent \nexample to all other new employees at the firm. He stated that Applicant told him of his \ndrug use three or four months before the January 21, 2009 security clearance hearing. \n(Tr. 130-136.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s witness also provided a letter of character reference. In addition, \nApplicant submitted eight other letters of character reference on his behalf.  All of the \nletters of character reference praised Applicant as an outstanding young man of \nsuperior character who was honest, reliable, and trustworthy. Applicant stated that his \nwitness was the only one of the nine persons who wrote letters of character reference \nwho was fully aware of the specific disqualifying conduct alleged on the SOR.  (Ex. A \nthrough I; Tr. 92-94.)    \n \n \nApplicant also spoke highly of his own character, and he noted that the nine \nletters of character reference \u201creveal my true integrity, loyalty, and enthusiasm, as an \noverall good person, and dedication to a healthy lifestyle.\u201d  (Tr. 14.) \n \n \nApplicant emphasized his increased maturity, and he reported his involvement in \nnumerous community activities and charitable service projects.  His plans for the future \ninclude paying off his student loans, marriage, and a graduate degree in business \nadministration.  (Ex. Q; Tr. 14-18.) \n \n \nApplicant tested negative in two random drug tests administered by his employer \nin May 2008 and August 2008. Additionally, he provided the following signed \nstatements:  \n \nStatement of intent:  January 2007 was the last time I used a drug.  I have \nsince pledged to remain disassociated from any type of drug using \nassociates or contacts, that I have change[d] and will avoid the \nenvironment where drugs were and are used, and that I will remain \nabstinent in the future. Again, I am trustworthy enough to protect classified \ninformation.  (Signed and notarized October 13, 2008) \n \nFor clarification purposes: \n \nI understand that a violation of my above agreement would result in an \nautomatic revocation of clearance.  (Signed and dated January 20, 2009. \n \n(Ex. M; Ex. N; Ex. O) \n \n                                                           Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n5 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.  AG \u00b6 24(a) defines drugs as \u201cmood and behavior altering \nsubstances.\u201d  The definition of drugs includes \u201c(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), \nand (2) inhalants and other similar substances.\u201d1 AG \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as \u201cthe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \n \nThe relevant Guideline H security concern in this case is referenced at AG \u00b6 \n25(a) of the Drug Involvement guideline.  The record shows that Applicant\u2019s admitted \nillegal use of marijuana began in November 2001, when he was 15 years old and \ncontinued until 2007, when he was 21 years old. During that time he also used cocaine \nonce, Adderall once, and mushrooms once. He used illegal drugs while employed by a \nfederal contractor. In 2003, his parents, who suspected he was using drugs, took him to \na drug treatment center for a drug test. When he tested positive, he was placed in a \ndrug counseling program for about two weeks. After completing the drug counseling \nprogram, he returned to drug use after one year. This conduct casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  It also raises security concerns about \nhis ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. I conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 24 and AG \u00b6 25(a). \n \nTwo Guideline H mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If Applicant\u2019s drug use happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, then AG \u00b6 26(a) might be \napplicable in mitigation.  If Applicant demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in \nthe future by disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used, abstaining from drug use for an \nappropriate period, and signing a statement of intent with the automatic revocation of \nhis security clearance for any violation, then AG \u00b6 26(b) might be applicable.  \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s use of mushrooms, cocaine, and Adderall  \nwas infrequent and happened between 2002 and 2005. These brief episodes of drug \n \n1 Schedules l, ll, lll, lV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule l controlled substance. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) \n(discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule 1.)  Mushrooms is the street name for psilocybin or \npsilocin, which is a Schedule l controlled substance. See United States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. \n2003 (mushrooms are a plant which may contain the Schedule l(c)15) and 1(c)(16) controlled substance \npsilocybin or psilocin.  Cocaine is a Schedule ll controlled substance.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nuse occurred under circumstances that are not likely to recur. I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n26(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use, on the other hand, was more intense and covered a \ntime span of over six years, from 2001 to 2007. It was the drug Applicant returned to \nafter resolving at least twice to stop using drugs. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was of \nsufficient duration to demonstrate a consistent lifestyle choice, despite cautionary drug \ncounseling. Applicant stated he had disassociated from drug-using associates and \navoided environments where drugs were used. He provided a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from all drug use, with automatic revocation of his security clearance \nfor any violation. However, while Applicant stated he had not used marijuana since \nJanuary 2007, he failed to provide evidence corroborating his statement about his \nabstinence from friends and others who knew him socially during the time of his drug \nuse. Applicant stated he had changed his behavior and activities after his last use of \nmarijuana in January 2007 and his subsequent decision to abstain from illegal drugs. \nThese decisions are still somewhat recent and the lifestyle change is of insufficient \nduration to demonstrate a positive and permanent change in behavior. I conclude that \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not fully apply in mitigation to the security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, applies in this case to a determination of \neligibility for access to classified information. Under Guideline G, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability.\u201d \n \n I have considered all of the Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions.  I \nhave especially considered AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c).2 \n \nApplicant admitted alcohol consumption from age 15, and he admitted that his \npast consumption had impaired his judgment. In May 2006, when he was 20 years old, \nApplicant was cited for presenting false documentation to a police officer. Four months \nlater, in September 2006, he was arrested and charged with under age possession of \nalcohol. He paid a fine and, in 2007, enrolled in an alcohol safety awareness program. \nThese facts raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). \n \nThe Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(a) if \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The disqualifying \n \n2 AG \u00b6  22(a) reads: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, \nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether \nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  AG \u00b6 22(c) reads: \u201chabitual or \nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d   \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconduct could also be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(b) if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d  If \u201cthe individual is a current \nemployee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of \nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress,\u201d then AG \u00b6 23(c) \nmight apply.  Finally, mitigation might be possible under AG \u00b6 23 (d) if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct occurred in adolescence and as a college \nstudent, when he was not old enough to drink alcohol legally. Now that he is of legal \nage to consume alcohol, he drinks alcohol about once a week. He drank to intoxication \nat his college graduation, Thanksgiving, and on New Year\u2019s Eve. As an adult, he has \nnot been cited for alcohol offenses, and he claims uses alcohol responsibly. He has not \nbeen diagnosed as alcohol dependent or as an abuser of alcohol.  I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n23(a) applies in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case and that AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b), 23(c), \nand 23(d) do not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. To his credit, Applicant himself \n\n \n9 \n \n \nprovided information about his drug and alcohol use that was alleged on the SOR. I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s underage alcohol consumption has been mitigated by the \npassage of time. Additionally, I conclude that his one-time uses of mushrooms in 2002, \ncocaine in 2004, and Adderall in 2005 were isolated uses of illegal drugs. However, he \nused marijuana 150 times between 2001 and January 2007.  After receiving drug \ncounseling in 2003, he continued his use of marijuana. After his cocaine use in 2004, \nand after his use of Adderall in 2005, he resolved to stop using drugs, but returned, after \ntime, to using marijuana. His last use of marijuana, in 2007, occurred two years after he \nresolved not to use illegal drugs again. \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant used marijuana while employed by a government \ncontractor and after he committed to his employer\u2019s code of business conduct and \nethics, including its drug-free workplace policy. His intermittent but repetitive marijuana \nuse suggested a lifestyle choice. I conclude that insufficient time has passed to \ndetermine if Applicant will abstain from illegal use of marijuana in the future. \n \n \n \nAs a part of this whole person analysis, I have also considered the fact that \nApplicant requested letters of recommendation from nine individuals and apprised only \none of those individuals of the totality of the SOR allegations of drug involvement and \nalcohol consumption. It is not clear what the other eight individuals might have written \nabout Applicant if he had informed them of the facts alleged in the SOR. Because those \nassessments of his character were not based upon knowledge of the conduct that gave \nrise to the SOR allegations, they have less credibility, and I gave them less weight. \n \nApplicant\u2019s resolve to abstain from illegal drug use will likely be demonstrated \nwith the passage of time. He can reapply for a security clearance one year after the \ndate that this decision becomes final.  If he wishes, he can produce new evidence that \naddresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated security concerns related to alcohol \nconsumption but failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) implemented by the Department of\nDefense on September 1, 2006.\n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 22, 2010. The case was assigned to me\non June 14, 2010, and was scheduled for hearing on July 22, 2010.  A hearing was held\non the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of 10 exhibits\nDecember 1, 2010\n\n2\n(GE).  All of the Government\u2019s exhibits were admitted.  Applicant relied on one witness\n(himself) and no exhibits (AE). The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 29, 2010. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) incurred one adverse judgment\n(subparagraph 1.a) in the amount of $4,018 and (b) accumulated 15 delinquent debts\nexceeding $61,000. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted one of the\nallegations (subparagraph 1.a) and denied the remaining ones. He provided no\nexplanations.\nProcedural issues\nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted a post-hearing settlement offer and\ndocumented repayment check with the judgment creditor covered by subparagraph 1.a.\nDepartment Counsel did not object to this post-hearing submission, and for good cause\nshown, the submission was admitted as AE A. Applicant later submitted documentation\nof his settlement of the debt covered by subparagraph 1.h and his involvement with a\nlocal charity in disaster preparedness. These exhibits, while filed out of time, were not\nobjected to by Department Counsel and were admitted for good cause shown as AEs B\nand C.\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 60-year-old simulations interactor for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The only allegation covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant is adopted as a relevant and material finding.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married W1 in December 1970. (GE. 1). Applicant divorced W1 in\nSeptember 1978. (GE. 1). Shortly thereafter, Applicant married W2.  He has two children\n(since emancipated) from this marriage. (Tr. 68) He divorced her in September 1987.\n(GE. 1)  Applicant married W3 in 1989 and has no children from this marriage. (GE 1)\nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1969. (GE 1; Tr. 66) He claims no\ncompleted college credits. (GE 1) In November 1970, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and\nserved 20 years of active duty before his honorable discharge in December 1990. (GE.\n1; Tr. 34, 66-67)  \nBetween 1992 and 1999, Applicant worked as a data collection for a contractor\nresponsible for missile systems development. (GE 1; Tr. 35-36) In this position, he held a\nsecurity clearance. When his employer\u2019s contract ended in 1999, Applicant joined\nanother contractor with missile defense development responsibilities (Tr. 37), and was\nultimately laid off by this contractor in September 2000 after his employer lost its\ngovernment contract. (GE 1; Tr. 71)  He was out of work for approximately nine months\nbefore he secured a position as a truck driver. (GE 1; Tr. 71-72)  \n\n3\nBetween May 2000 and February 2003, Applicant worked for another defense\ncontractor.  When his company\u2019s contract expired, Applicant became unemployed again.\nHe was unemployed for about 18 months before he secured a job with another defense\ncontractor in 2004. (Tr. 72-73, 102) Applicant worked for several defense contractors\nbetween 2003 and 2006 (each requiring a security clearance). In each of his jobs, he\nmade less money than he was accustomed to making, even after his unemployment\nbenefits expired. (Tr. 41, 102). He experienced no identifiable financial setbacks between\n2004 and the present that he could document. (GE 1; Tr. 38-42)  \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nDuring his recurrent periods of unemployment, Applicant drew unemployment\nbenefits (Tr. 37), and fell further behind in his debts. He had already stopped paying his\ndebts following his 2001 layoff, and fell even further behind with his creditors after his\n2003 layoff. (see GE 8; Tr. 73-74)  Altogether, Applicant accumulated delinquencies with\n16 of his creditors for more than $61,000. One of these debts is a judgment that creditor\n1.a obtained in May 2006 for $4,018. Applicant claims no knowledge of the initiated suit\nagainst him prior to June 2006. (GE 8) His first notice of creditor 1.a\u2019s suit against him,\nand scheduled default hearing, came in a registered letter he received in 2006. (Tr. 76)\nApplicant did not respond to the notice or take any action to prevent the judgment from\nbeing entered against him. (Tr. 78)\nApplicant consulted a bankruptcy lawyer in 2004 and was told that most of the\ndebts were charged off, and the remaining ones would be charged off. (Tr. 74) Applicant\nrelied on his lawyer\u2019s advice and initiated no repayment actions on his debts. (GE 6).\nToday, he claims a number of the listed debts (specifically, creditors 1.f, 1.i, and 1.l) in\nthe SOR are duplicates of others in the SOR (viz., creditors 1.c, 1.e, and 1.k), but\nprovides no documentary proof. (Tr. 83-86)  He also claims he tried to contact the listed\ncreditors but found no creditor willing to work with repayment plans. (Tr. 80-83)\nOf the remaining listed debts in the SOR, Applicant recognized only creditors 1.a,\n1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.n through 1.p. He was never able to complete any repayment\narrangements with most of these creditors, and has made only limited payments and\npayment offers to any of these creditors since the accounts became delinquent.  \nBeginning in 2006, Applicant received letters from a number of his creditors\nseeking collection of the delinquent balances, including the judgment creditor covered by\nsubparagraph 1.a. (GE 6)  Still, Applicant refused to pay any of his listed creditors. He\ncontinues to treat most of these delinquent debts as charged off accounts and has made\nfew concerted attempts to address these creditors prior to the hearing.  (see GE 6 and\nAEs A and B; Tr. 101)\nIn October 2010, Applicant completed a payment arrangement with the judgment\ncreditor covered by subparagraph 1.a.  Under the terms of his payment arrangement, he\nwas required to remit the sum of $2,300 to the judgment creditor by September 24, 2010\nto settle this judgment debt. Applicant documents his paying the required settlement sum\nin September 2010 in full satisfaction of the entered judgment. (see AE A) Applicant also\n\n4\ndocumented his settlement of his creditor 1.h debt to the satisfaction of the listed\ncreditor. (AE B) His remaining debts covered in the SOR remain either unpaid,\nunresolved, or not credibly disputed.\nApplicant currently nets around $2,600 a month from his work and receives an\nadditional $1,300 a month from his service retirement. (see GE 8; Tr. 70-71, 91-92) His\nwife nets around $500 a month in social security benefits. (Tr. 92) \nApplicant owns a 2008 Dodge truck; while W3 owns a 2005 Cadillac. (Tr.93-94)\nHe and W3 own a home and make monthly mortgage payments of $720 on the home.\nApplicant has a net monthly remainder of about $935 (GE 8), and he has $14,000 in his\n401(k) retirement account. (Tr. 100) He assures that he is current with his state and\nfederal taxes.  Without any available payment plans, he is not in a position to address\nany of his remaining delinquent debts.  (Tr. 101)  \nCommunity service\nIn June 1998, Applicant participated in local disaster preparedness efforts in his\ncommunity. His efforts were sponsored and recognized by a respected charitable\norganization. (see ex. C) He provided no endorsements from his employment, however,\nor performance evaluations.  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\n\n5\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800 (1988).  As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge\ncannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\n\n6\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a senior simulations interactor for a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts (to include an adverse judgment) during\nrecurrent periods of unemployment between 2001 and 2004. His accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability and unwillingness to address these debts\nwarrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines:\nDC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his inability to find well-paying work\nfollowing his layoff in December 2001. After credits for the two debts he has since\nsettled, his unpaid and unresolved delinquent debts still exceed $50,000.\nBased on the documented materials in the record, some extenuating\ncircumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s inability to pay of or otherwise resolve\nmost of his debts. Available to Applicant is MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly.\u201d\nMoreover, some judgment problems persist over Applicant\u2019s unexplained\ncontinuing delinquencies and his failure to demonstrate he acted responsibly in\naddressing his listed debts once the underemployment conditions that contributed to\nthe delinquencies had passed or eased, and his finances had improved.  See ISCR\nCase 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004).  Not only are his listed debt\ndelinquencies ongoing, but he has failed to address most of them in any tangible way. \nTo be sure, most of Applicant\u2019s listed debts appear to have been placed in\ncollection before 2002, and are likely barred by his state\u2019s controlling statute of\nlimitations. The only clear exception are the creditor 1.a judgment debt and 1.h\nconsumer debt that he has since satisfied.  None of Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquent\ndebts reflect any collection action by the individual creditors involved.  Based on this\nrecord, most of Applicant\u2019s covered debts appear to be barred from collection by the\npertinent four-year statute of limitation in his state of domicile. See \u00a7\u00a716.004(c) and\n16.051 (statute of limitations for contracts) and (statute of limitations for debts) of T.\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code.\nStatutes of limitation, while considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation, have never\nbeen equated with good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors in security clearance\n\n7\njurisprudence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(citing\nISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001). Still, they provide effective\ncollection barriers and, like bankruptcy, serve to insulate the debtor from pressures to\nraise cash to satisfy his or her creditors.\nMitigation credit is not available to Applicant based on the evidence developed\nin this record.  Extenuating  circumstances are not sufficiently shown by Applicant to\njustify relieving him of his payment responsibilities once he returned to full-time\nemployment in 2004.  While his state\u2019s statute of limitations may protect him from any\ncollection enforcement by any of his outstanding creditors, it does not excuse his\njudgment lapses associated with his failure to make any documented efforts to pay or\nresolve his debts before or after they became time-barred.  \n                                          \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on Government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\nGovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).\nFailure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve his debts when\nable to do so raises security-significant concerns about whether the applicant has\ndemonstrated the trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified information.\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts and failure to address them\nin a timely way once he returned to the active work force in 2004. Resolution of his\ndelinquent accounts is a critical prerequisite to his maintaining control of his  finances.\nPayment of two of his accounts following the hearing, while commendable, is not\nenough to credit him with restoring his finances to stable levels, commensurate with\nholding a security clearance.   \nWhile unemployment conditions played a considerable role in his accumulation\nof so many debts over a relatively short period, Applicant failed to provide sufficient\nexplanations for his failure to address them after he returned to the active work force.\nEndorsements and performance evaluations might have been helpful, too, in making a\nwhole-person assessment of his overall clearance eligibility, but were not provided.\nOverall, clearance eligibility assessment of Applicant does not enable him to establish\njudgment and trust levels sufficient to overcome security concerns arising out of his\naccumulation of delinquent debts.\nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s recurrent periods of unemployment, his debt accumulations, and his failure\nto address them before the hearing, it is still too soon to make safe predictive\njudgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and restore his finances to\nstable levels commensurate with the minimum requirements for holding a security\nclearance.\n\n8\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.b through 1.g and 1.i through 1.p.  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.h are\nmitigated.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \n       Subparas. 1.b, through 1.g and 1.i through 1.p: Against Applicant\n       Subparas.  1.a and 1.h:\n       For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Ronald C. Sykstus, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on January 6, 2006. On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nSeptember 18, 2008. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on that \nsame date. Applicant\u2019s counsel entered his appearance on September 23, 2008. The \ncase was transferred to me on November 17, 2008. On December 3, 2008, a Notice of \nHearing was issued scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2008. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 3, which \nJanuary 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwere admitted without objection. The Government requested that administrative notice \nbe taken of one document with four attachments. The document was marked as \nAdministrative Notice Document I (Admin Not I) without objection. The Government \nrequested SOR \u00b6 1.d be amended. It was amended without objection. (Tr at 111.) \nApplicant\u2019s counsel called seven witnesses, including Applicant, and submitted four \nexhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D without objection. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested that administrative notice be taken of one document \nwhich was marked as Admin Not II without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nhearing on December 23, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nAdministrative Notice  \n \nThe Kingdom of Thailand is a constitutional monarchy. Thailand has an open \nmarket/free enterprise economy with a great deal of foreign investment. Approximately \n40% of Thailand\u2019s labor force is agricultural, with rice being its most important crop. It \nalso has an increasingly diversified manufacturing sector. The United States is \nThailand\u2019s largest export market and third largest supplier after Japan and China. \n(Admin Not I, atch 1, atch 2.) \n \nThailand has good relations and military alliances with the United States for over \n175 years. Thailand and the United States have cooperated on a wide variety of \ndiplomatic and foreign policy issues.  Thailand is a strong ally in the war against terror.  \n(Admin Not I, atch 4; Admin Not II.)  \n \nThe U.S. State Department has criticized the Thai government\u2019s overall human \nrights record. Although there are no recent reports of politically motivated \ndisappearances, torture, arbitrary arrests, and detentions, have been reported in \nprevious years under past and present Thai regimes. Despite constitutional protections \nafforded to freedom of speech and freedom of the press, the government still maintains \nbroad powers to restrict freedom of speech and freedom of the press. (Admin Not I, atch \n3, atch 4.) \n \nThe U.S. State Department is concerned there is an increased risk of terrorism in \nSoutheast Asia, including Thailand. Thailand\u2019s southern region has experienced \ncriminally and politically motivated violence, including incidents attributed to local \nseparatist/extremist groups. Recent violence has targeted public places, including \ntourist areas. (Admin Not I, atch 2.) \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, notarized on August 11, 2008, Applicant denied the \noverall concern about having divided loyalties and denied SOR \u00b6 1.d. He admits SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e and 1.f.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is the president of a defense contractor. He is 47-years-old and has \nheld a SECRET security clearance since 1985 and a TOP SECRET security clearance \nsince 1990. He has over 23 years experience in the defense industry. He was hired by \nhis current company in 1996 as a communications engineer. His company installs \ninfrastructure and telecommunications systems at U.S. embassies, consulates, and \ntenants of the U.S. embassies worldwide. From 1996 to 2002, he traveled around the \nworld as a team leader. In 2002, he took over as the operations manager in the \ncorporate office which is located in the U.S. In 2003 or 2004, he was appointed \nPresident and became a 10% shareholder in the company. (Tr at 23, 27-31; AE A; AE \nC.) \n \nApplicant has been married for ten years. His wife is a permanent resident of the \nU.S. and a citizen of Thailand. They have a three-year-old daughter, who was born in \nthe U.S. He met his wife while overseas on business in 1996.  When the relationship \nbecame serious, he immediately reported to his facility security officer (FSO) that he \nwas dating a non-U.S. citizen.  They dated for awhile and eventually married in \nDecember 1998.  They moved to the U.S. in 2002. Applicant\u2019s wife became a \npermanent resident in May 2006, and intends to apply for U.S citizenship as soon as \nshe is eligible.  (Tr at 23-26, 76-77.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents, sister, and nephew are citizens of and reside in \nThailand. They are farmers.  Prior to their marriage, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law deeded \ntwo pieces of property to Applicant\u2019s wife. He was concerned that she would not be able \nto own the land after marrying a foreigner under Thai law.  His in-laws continue to farm \none plot of land. Applicant and his wife built a 90 square foot house on the other \nproperty which is about two acres. His in-laws reside in the house. Applicant\u2019s wife also \npurchased some land adjacent to the house which her parents also farm. Applicant \nestimates that his wife owns a total of five acres of farm land. The total value of the \nproperty is approximately $40,000.  (Tr at 33-36, 51-53.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law and nephew reside in Thailand with her parents. She \nhelps out with the farm. Her husband works and lives in South Korea in order to support \nthe family. His wife\u2019s grandparents and extended family members, such as aunts, \nuncles, and cousins live and farm in the same area where his parents-in-law reside. \nNone of his in-laws work for the Thai government or have served in the Thai military.  \nHis wife is close to her family members in Thailand.  Applicant does not speak Thai so \nhe does not communicate much with his wife\u2019s family members because they don\u2019t \nspeak English.  None of his in-laws have visited Applicant and his family in the U.S. (Tr \nat 34, 40, 54, 61-68.) \n \nPrior to moving to the U.S. in 2002, Applicant\u2019s wife would travel with him to \nvarious work sites throughout the world. If the work site was located near Thailand, \nApplicant would drop her off in Thailand. She would visit with her family while he \nworked. Applicant and his wife have three bank accounts in Thailand. The total value of \nthe accounts is $9,000. He sees this as an insignificant amount of money. The accounts \nwere opened in order to allow his wife to have access to funds when she was visiting \n\n \n4 \n \n \nher family in Thailand and he was away on business. They no longer have a need for \nthe accounts since they have lived in the U.S. since 2002 and do not travel as \nextensively. They intended to close the bank accounts during a trip to Thailand this \nsummer but cancelled their travel plans after receiving the SOR.  They intend to close \nthe bank accounts the next time they travel to Thailand. (Tr at 35-36; 53-54.) \n \nAside from the bank accounts, Applicant has no other foreign property or \ninvestments. Most of his assets are located in the U.S. Including the value of his interest \nin the company, his net worth is approximately $1,000,000. (Tr at 56-58; AE D.) He has \na grown son and daughter from a previous marriage. His mother lives in Florida. (Tr at \n44-45.)    \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified.  She indicated that they moved to the U.S. in 2002. She \nreceived her permanent resident status in May 2006. She intends to become a U.S. \ncitizen. She has no plans to move back to Thailand. She is happy living in the U.S. Her \ndaughter was born here and they intend to raise her in the U.S.  She is close to her \nfamily members in Thailand. (Tr at 58-70.) \n \nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nHe started the company in June 1977. The company currently has 25 employees but \nthat varies based on the work load. His company installs and works on classified \ncommunications for the State Department, U.S Embassies and the tenants located at \nthe U.S. Embassies. His company originally started out in construction. They started \nclassified work in 1994. He has held a SECRET security clearance since 1994 and TOP \nSECRET since 1996. He hired the Applicant in 1996. He and Applicant have worked \nclosely together for years.  They traveled all around the world to various work sites \ntogether.  They got to know and trust each other. He asked Applicant to become \ncompany president about four years ago because of his trust in him. He is very pleased \nwith his job performance. (Tr at 95\u2013100.)  \n \nThe CEO admits to being initially concerned when Applicant began dating his \nwife but those concerns dissipated once he got to know her.  He has no concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s ability to safely handle classified information. He has observed Applicant \nidentify, isolate, and report major security breaches. He has no concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s wife being a citizen of Thailand. She has never interfered with Applicant\u2019s \nwork. She does not ask questions. She has never gone to a work site when they were \nworking in the field. She has never asked to go to a work site. Applicant and his wife are \none of the few people that he trusts. (Tr at 100-102.) \n \nThe former FSO of Applicant\u2019s company testified. She worked for the company \nfrom 1987 to 2007 until she retired. She started out as a dispatcher. She became the \nFSO in 1995/1996.  She served as the FSO until she retired. She held a TOP SECRET \nsecurity clearance.  She first met Applicant in 1996 when he applied for a job with the \ncompany. She recalls he immediately disclosed to her that he was dating a non-U.S. \ncitizen when he began dating his wife. They forwarded a report to the Defense Security \nService. She worked with Applicant on daily basis when he accepted a job in the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nheadquarters office. She met his wife in 2000. She would go out to lunch and dinner \nwith his wife. She used to take her shopping when she did not have a driver\u2019s license. \nShe still occasionally visits with Applicant\u2019s wife. The FSO states that Applicant is \u201ca \nstickler for security.\u201d It has to be done right. He likes his job. He takes security matters \nseriously. She does not think he would ever jeopardize his situation. (Tr at 72-81.) \n \nThe current FSO testified. She has been with the company for close to three \nyears. She received her TOP SECRET security clearance in March 2007.  Applicant \nhired and trained her. Applicant is her mentor. He is very sensitive about security \nmatters. She knows Applicant\u2019s wife. She taught her how to cook Thai cuisine.  She has \nalso gone out to lunch and dinner with his wife.  No one has expressed concerns about \nApplicant and how he handles classified information.  The current FSO is proud of the \nfact that the company received a \u201csuperior\u201d rating from the Defense Security Service in \nOctober 2008 after the company went through a security inspection in September 2008. \n(Tr at 82-86; AE B.) \n \nThe company\u2019s comptroller testified. She has been the company\u2019s comptroller for \n18 years. She handles finances for the company. She has held a TOP SECRET \nsecurity clearance since December 1995/January 1996. She first met Applicant when \nhe applied for a position with the company.  She began to work closely with him when \nhe became the operations manager in 2002. He is now the president of the company. \nApplicant is very aware of everything that goes on in the office. She knows his wife. She \ncomes by for lunch occasionally at the office. She sometime socializes with them \noutside of the office. She describes the office as a regular office.  She has no concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s ability to handle classified information.  She does not believe that he \nwould jeopardize national security. (Tr at 89-92.)  \n \nThe company\u2019s certified public account (CPA) testified. He is also on the board of \ndirectors and is a 10% minority shareholder of the company. He started his own \naccounting firm in 1982. He travels to Applicant\u2019s company once a month to review \ncontracts and financial records. He has had a TOP SECRET security clearance for \nabout 12 years. He has worked with Applicant on a regular basis since 2002. Applicant \ndoes an excellent job. He knows Applicant\u2019s wife but does not see her frequently. \nApplicant is very rule conscious and would never jeopardize national security. He has a \n100% comfort level with Applicant being president of the company. (Tr at 105-110.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case \nbecause his wife is a Thai citizen and her parents and sister are Thai citizens residing in \nThailand. Specifically, FI DC \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion); FI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing that information); and FI \nDC \u00b6 7(c) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion) apply.  Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s ties to Thailand and the possible effect \nthey may have on Applicant\u2019s conduct are relevant considerations under this guideline. \nISCR Case No. 01-02452 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov, 21, 2002). There is a rebuttable \npresumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family \nmembers of the person\u2019s spouse. ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002).  \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation) applies with respect to \nthe land Applicant\u2019s wife owns in Thailand. Although the deeds are in her name, \nApplicant funded the building on one of the properties, and provided the funds for his \nwife to purchase the plot of land adjacent to the house. The three joint bank accounts \nwith Thai banks also raises a concern under FI DC \u00b6 7(e). \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Foreign Influence. I find the following Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the U.S.).  Applicant\u2019s wife is close to her family members in \nThailand. However, none of her family members who are citizens of and reside in \nThailand work for the Thai government. They are not politically active. They are farmers. \nThe Thai government has had a close relationship with the U.S. for over 175 years. \nConsidering the Thai government\u2019s good relationship with the U.S.; and the status and \noccupations of Applicant\u2019s in-laws who reside in Thailand, it is unlikely that Applicant will \n\n \n8 \n \n \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his in-laws and the \ninterests of the U.S.  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest). While Applicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens of and reside in Thailand, his \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. support the premise that \nApplicant will resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests. Applicant was \nborn and raised in the U.S.  He has worked in the defense industry for over 23 years. \nHe has possessed a security clearance over that same period and with no security \nviolations. His superiors, co-workers, and friends all attest to his trustworthiness. The \npeople he is closest to, his wife and daughter, reside in the U.S.  His deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. indicate Applicant can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests.  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual).  Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial interests located in the U.S. are far more significant than the interests located \nin Thailand. His wife owns the property that is valued at $40,000. However, her family \nhas exclusive use of the home and the land.  Applicant does not consider these \nproperties as his and is unlikely to be influenced by them. Applicant and his wife had a \ngood reason to establish the three bank accounts located in Thailand. The total value of \nthe accounts is approximately $9,000. Applicant does not consider this to be a lot of \nmoney and intends to close the accounts the next time he travels to Thailand. \nApplicant\u2019s net worth in the U.S. is over $1,000,000. It is unlikely any of the interests in \nThailand will result in a conflict for Applicant.  \n    \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under foreign influence.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \n\n \n9 \n \n \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to his in-laws in Thailand, a country that has good relations with \nthe U.S. I also considered that Applicant is a highly regarded employee with a defense \ncontractor, having worked his way up to become President and part-owner of the \ncompany. I considered the favorable recommendations of Applicant\u2019s co-workers, their \nattestation that Applicant is extremely security conscious, and his 23 years of working \nwith classified information with no security violations.

Eisen, Esq\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 9, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn February 6, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge improperly\nignored Appeal Board precedent in reaching his decision; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the\nForeign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FIMC) was not supported by record evidence; whether the\nJudge improperly shifted the burden of persuasion to the Government; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable security clearance decision is unsustainable.  Finding error, we reverse the decision of the\nJudge. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a software engineer for\na defense contractor, who had held a security clearance since the early 1990s.  Born in Iran, he came\nto the U.S. in the mid-1970s and attended college.  He earned several Bachelor degrees from U.S.\nuniversities, as well a Masters.  In the early 1980s he married and had three children.  He divorced,\nand, in the early 1990s, he subsequently remarried, to a U.S. citizen.  In the early 1990s Applicant\nbecame a U.S. citizen.  \nApplicant\u2019s parents, Iranian citizens, are deceased.  He has four siblings and one half-sibling,\nwho are citizens and residents of Iran.  He has never discussed his work with them, and they do not\nknow what he does for a living.  Applicant has traveled to Iran on several occasions between the\nmid-1990s and the early 2000s.  He traveled on an Iranian passport, because he had been informed\nby Iranian officials that he could not obtain a visa on a U.S. passport.  His Iranian passport has\nexpired, and he has since relinquished it to his company\u2019s facility security officer.  \nThe U.S. has designated Iran as \u201cthe most active state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d  Decision at 5.\nIt supports violent opposition to the middle-east peace process and commits serious human rights\nabuses.  The Iranian government considers U.S. citizens born in Iran to be Iranian citizens.  Such\npersons have been harassed by the Iranian government when traveling in Iran.    \nB.  Discussion\n\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we defer to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge\u2019s decision does not sufficiently take into\naccount contrary record evidence will be addressed below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n\nApplicant notes on appeal that there is no record evidence of his use of the word \u201clove\u201d for his siblings.\n1\nApplicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that his affection for them is minimal.  \n4\nThe Guideline B security concern is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern in the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact . . . is located.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.6. The Judge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s family\nconnections to Iran raise security concerns under Guideline B.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-26893\n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (There is a rational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a\ncountry whose interests are adverse to the United States and the risk that the applicant might fail to\nprotect and safeguard classified information.)  However, Department Counsel persuasively argues\nthat the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.\nSpecifically, Department Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision was made without sufficient\nattention to contrary record evidence.  \nIn concluding that Applicant had mitigated the security concerns in his case, the Judge\nappears to have relied on record evidence that Applicant has little sense of loyalty to Iran, that he is\nopposed to that regime, and that he is a devoted U.S. citizen. While that is evidence which the Judge\nwas bound to consider, it does not end the analysis.  The Guideline B security concern is not limited\nto consideration of an applicant\u2019s loyalty to a foreign country itself.  It also requires consideration\nof an applicant\u2019s attachment or obligation to persons or other interests in the foreign country. The\nBoard notes the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant has four siblings who live in Iran, that Applicant has\nfeelings of affection for them,  and that the Iranian regime considers persons such as Applicant and\n1\nhis wife to be Iranian citizens.  The Board also notes record evidence that, until his mother\u2019s death\nin 2007, Applicant communicated with his siblings frequently and, since her death, maintains at least\nbiannual contact with them.  The Board notes the Judge\u2019s findings as to the nature of the Iranian\ngovernment, its sponsorship of terrorism and its human rights violations.  It also notes matters\ncontained in the Official Notice documents submitted by the Government, to the effect that the\nIranian regime monitors the social activities of its citizens, monitors telephone conversations and\ninternet communications, and opens mail without court authorization.  U.S. Department of State,\nCountry Report on Human Rights Practices - 2007 at 9 (March 11, 2008).  The Board also notes that\nIran\u2019s president has called for the elimination of Israel and has questioned the historical validity of\nthe holocaust.  Id. at 15.   It has provided support for groups in Iraq and Afghanistan which are\ndirectly responsible for hundreds of U.S. casualties.  Testimony of William J Burns, Undersecretary\nof State for Political Affairs, to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (July 9, 2008).   \nThe Judge\u2019s  findings, the record evidence, and the Official Notice material, taken together,\ndemonstrate that Applicant\u2019s close relatives reside in a country whose interests are contrary to those\nof the U.S.  In light of the record as a whole, it is foreseeable that these relatives could be a means\nthrough which Applicant could come to the attention of the regime.  His family could be a vehicle\nthrough which Iran might attempt to coerce  Applicant.  Despite Applicant\u2019s testimony and other\n\nApplicant accurately cites the Adjudicative Guidelines in this regard.  However, the totality of the personal\n2\ncircumstances being considered includes the nature of the country.  In this case, the relatives\u2019 obscurity is not a\nmeaningful basis for concluding that they are beyond the reach of the regime.\n5\nevidence that he has no loyalty to Iran, there is not sufficient evidence to demonstrate that his ties\nto the U.S. outweigh  his sense of obligation to his Iranian relatives.  Department Counsel points out\nthe Judge\u2019s statement to the effect that there is no evidence that Applicant or his family have ever\nbeen targeted by the Iranian regime.  The Board has consistently held that factors such as an\napplicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 obscurity or the failure of foreign authorities to contact those relatives in the\npast do not provide a meaningful measure of whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances pose a security\nrisk, when, for example, the relatives are subject to the authority of a regime that is hostile to the\nUnited States and has a dismal human rights record.   ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb.\n2\n9, 2009).  The Judge\u2019s statement suggests that he has impermissibly shifted the burden of persuasion\nto the Government.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-09907 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2004) (Under the\nDirective, once the Judge finds that security concerns have been raised, the burden shifts to an\napplicant to extenuate or mitigate those concerns.  Department Counsel is not required to prove a\nthreat of espionage.)  Department Counsel also correctly notes that the Judge appears to have ignored\nAppeal Board precedent in formulating his decision, which is error.  For a fuller discussion, see\nISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 3.  In light of the foregoing, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable security clearance decision is not sustainable on this record.\nOrder          \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant\u2019s father died while Applicant was in \nhigh school. In 1975, following high school graduation, Applicant came to the United \nStates on a student visa. In 1979, while Applicant was still in school, the Shah of Iran \nwas overthrown and an Islamic state emerged. Applicant loves his family, but his views \nare in opposition of the current Iranian regime. (Ex 3) He does not like the Iranian \ngovernment and believes it to be a nightmare for Iran. (Ex. 4) Applicant earned a \nBachelor of Science degree in civil engineering and decided to remain in the U.S. \nFollowing graduation, he was unable to secure employment in his field of study.  \n \n \nIn 1984, Applicant met his wife, married, moved to another state to be close to \nhis wife\u2019s relatives, and enrolled at university. (Tr. 46, 47) Three children were born of \nhis marriage. His oldest son, now 26, graduated from college with a business degree \nand is self-supporting. His daughter is an art education major, who is graduating this \nyear. His youngest son is in his second year at university. His marriage ended in divorce \nin 1990. Since his divorce, Applicant remains close to this children.  \n \n  \nIn 1987, he earned two additional Bachelor of Science degrees, one in \nmathematics and the other in computer science. Upon graduation, he obtained \nemployment with his present employer. (Tr. 48) In October 1992, Applicant became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. Since becoming a citizen, Applicant has regularly voted in \nfederal, state, and local U.S. elections. (Tr. 103) In 1997, Applicant earned a Master of \nScience degree in software engineering. (Tr. 97)  \n \n \nIn 1994, Applicant remarried an American citizen from the Philippines who works \nas a nurse\u2019s aid. His wife does not hold a Filipino passport and does not consider \nherself to be a Filipino citizen. (Ex. 4) They have two children ages 2 and 9. (Tr. 51) All \nof Applicant\u2019s children were born in the U.S. Applicant has $300,000 in equity in his \nhome and $350,000 in his 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 55-56, Ex. E) \n \n\n \n \n \n4\n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s father ran an auto parts store. (Tr. 42) Applicant has a brother, three \nsisters and a half-sister. (Tr. 42) His parents are both dead. None of his siblings work for \nthe Iranian government. None of his siblings have ever visited him in the U.S. (Ex 4) \nApplicant does not discuss with them where he works or what he does. (Ex. 5) Applicant \nhas not sent a letter to any of his siblings during the past 25 years. (Tr. 70, Ex. 5) \nApplicant\u2019s half-sister now lives in Canada. (Tr. 70) As of February 2007, Applicant had \nnot talked to his half-sister for four or five years due to a conflict with the rest of the \nfamily. (Tr. 77, Ex 5) Applicant had an aunt living in the U.S. who died a few days before \nhis mother. (Tr. 80) He has cousins living in the U.S. who are American citizens. (Tr. 80)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, prior her death was a housewife. His brother is a retired \nophthalmologist.3 Three of his sisters are housewives. One sister is widowed. One is \nmarried to an oil refinery worker, who may be retired now, and their daughter is an art \nmajor studying in at a university in Kansas. His other sister\u2019s husband owes a travel \nagency. (Tr. 79) None of his siblings know what he does. He has never talked about it \nand they never asked. (Tr. 69) \n \n \nMilitary service is required all males in Iran. However, Applicant never served in \nthe Iranian military. In 1995, Applicant returned to Iran. He was then 37-years-old and \nhad passed the age of military conscription. (Tr. 63) He decided to visit his mother and \nsiblings whom he had not seen in 20 years. Even though he was now a U.S. citizen, \nApplicant was told by the Interest Section (IS) of the Islamic Republic of Iran that he \ncould not obtain a visa to enter Iran using a U.S. passport, because Iran considers him \nto be an Iranian citizen due to his birth in Iran. (Ex. 4) Applicant obtained an Iranian \npassport and went to Iran.  \n \nAlthough married, he went to Iran by himself for he did not know what to expect, \nthought it might be dangerous, and did not want to subject his wife to possible danger. \n(Tr. 64) He had been gone 20 years and entered Iran as if he was entering a foreign \ncountry. He found a country much transformed. The people lacked basic freedom and \n\u201cthings were like nearly all in shades of gray.\u201d (Tr. 65) His trip made him appreciate \neven more the freedom and civil liberties enjoyed in the U.S. \n \nApplicant\u2018s Iranian passport expired in November 2002. (Ex 5) In April 2008, \nApplicant surrendered his expired Iranian passport to his company\u2019s facility security \nofficer (FSO). (Tr. 88, Ex. 6)  \n \n \nIn 1998, Applicant returned to Iran, this time with his wife, to introduce his wife to \nhis mother and family. Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport was changed to include his wife. \n(Ex. 4, 5) That passport allowed him to visit Iran for a period of up to four months \naccompanied by his spouse and one child. He stayed two to three weeks in Iran. (Tr. \n67) In 2001, following the birth of his daughter, he returned to Iran to attend his niece\u2019s \nwedding. (Ex. 5) In 2002, Applicant made his last trip to Iran. He was in London on \n \n3 Ophthalmology is the branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of eye \ndisorders.  \n \n\n \n \n \n5\n                                                          \nbusiness and decided to make a final visit to see and say goodbye to his mother, who \nwas elderly and suffering with health problems (Tr. 68, 76)  \n \nAt that time, his Iranian passport was due to expire and he did not intend to \nrenew it. He realized that without an Iranian passport he would not be allowed to enter \nIran. Applicant used his Iranian passport only on his travels to Iran.  \n \n \nApplicant considers himself an American citizen and not an Iranian citizen. (Ex. \n4) Applicant fully informed his employer of his Iranian trips. In 2007, Applicant\u2019s mother \ndied. Applicant did not attend her funeral. Since her death, Applicant has made a few \ntelephone calls to his relatives in Iran related to his mother\u2019s death and on the \nanniversaries of her death. (Tr. 82, 84) Applicant has in-laws, cousins, nieces, and \nnephews living in Iran. His contact with these individuals is even less than with his \nsiblings. Applicant has no property or financial interest in Iran. In 2007, he was elected \nthe president of his homeowner\u2019s association. He has no intent of returning to Iran. (Tr. \n88) He is extremely proud of being a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 101) \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d  \n \nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n$ \nIran=s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction; \n$ \nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n$ \nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process;  \n$ \nIts dismal human rights record; and \n$ \nIran=s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.4 \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor \nof terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. The government \nof Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against the Iranian \npeople. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary executions, \nincluding of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; severe \nrestrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement and \nprivacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and legal \n \n4U.S. Department of State; Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 3 \u2013 State Sponsors of \nTerrorism Overview, dated April 30, 2008, U.S. Department of State, State Sponsors of Terrorism. \n\n \n \n \n6\nand societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens\u2014even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian- \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personnel possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n\n \n \n \n7\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nIn every case where a sibling lives overseas, there is a risk of pressure on this \nrelative and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. Under the facts of \nthis case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, manipulation pressure, or \ncoercion is substantiated. However, Applicant has significant ties to the U.S. and few \nties to Iran. While he still has four siblings living in Iran, he lives with his wife in the U.S. \nHis five children were born in the U.S. He has no financial or property interests in Iran. \nHe owns a home in the U.S. and his ties with the U.S. are much stronger than his ties \nwith Iran. \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s brother and three sisters are citizens and residents of Iran. \nHaving considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, applicable \nconditions that could possibly raise a security concern are AG & 7(a) \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and AG & 7(b) \n\n \n \n \n8\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information\u201d apply. \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority;  \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nIn 1975, Applicant left Iran. In 1992, he become a U.S. citizen and in 1993, \nobtained a secret security clearance. He has been with the same employer since 1987 \nand his work performance has been outstanding. In 1995, twenty years after he left Iran \nhe returned to visit his family. He has made four visits to Iran with his last visit in 2002. \nIn 2007, his mother died and since her death his contact with his brother and three \nsisters who live in Iran has been limited to a couple of times a year. In April 2008, \nApplicant surrendered his Iranian passport, which expired in November 2002 to his \ncompany\u2019s FSO.  \n\n \n \n \n9\n                                                          \nAG && 8(a) and 8(c)5 partially apply. Because of his limited contact with his \nsiblings, \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterest of [his family living in Iran] and the interest of the U.S.\u201d His infrequent contacts \n(twice a year) and not particularly close relationship with his siblings since his mother\u2019s \ndeath have a very low potential for forcing him to choose between the United States and \nIran. He met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with his \nIranian siblings] could create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \u201c However AG \n&& 8(a) and 8(b) cannot be fully applied because of Iran\u2019s hostile relationship with the \nU.S and Iran\u2019s negative human rights record makes it more likely that Iran would violate \nthe law to gain classified information.  \n \nWhile danger certainly exists for all who go to Iran, Applicant and his siblings are \nin no greater danger than any other individual living and working in Iran. Applicant is in \nless danger since he no longer travels to Iran. None of his siblings know what he does. \nHe has never talked about it and they never asked.  \n \nThere is no evidence that terrorists or the Iranian Government have approached \nor threatened Applicant or his siblings for any reason. There is no evidence that his \nsiblings living in Iran currently engages in activities which would bring attention to them \nor that they or other Iranian elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s work. As such, \nthere is a reduced possibility that his siblings or Applicant would be targets for coercion \nor exploitation. None of Applicant siblings work for a foreign government and none are \ninvolved with organizations which seek to harm the U.S. \n \n \n5 In ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 3, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id. In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), \nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives  \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)) and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \n\u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many \nof these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person concept.   \n \n\n \n \n \n10\nAG & 8(b) fully applies. There is no evidence that his siblings or their spouses \nhave been political activists, challenging the policies of the Iranian Government. There \nis no evidence any of them currently works or ever worked for the Iranian Government, \nmilitary, or new media, or that of any other foreign government. Applicant\u2019s mother, prior \nher death was a housewife. His brother is a retired ophthalmologist and sisters are \nhousewives. One sister is widowed. One is married to the owner of a travel agency. And \nthe other is married to an oil refinery worker, who may now be retired, and their \ndaughter is a student at a U.S. university.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s first wife, current wife, and five children are all U.S. citizens living in \nthe U.S. He has $300,000 in equity in his home and $350,000 in his 401(k) retirement \nplan, all in the U.S. He has no foreign property or income.  \n \nApplicant was born in Iran 52 years ago. He came to the United States following \nhigh school to attend college. He obtained three BS and one MS degrees from U.S. \nuniversities. He chose to stay in the U.S., following the 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran and \nthe emergency of the Islamic state. Applicant loves his siblings, but his views are in \nopposition of the current Iranian regime. His four trips to Iran reinforced his appreciation \nfor the freedom he has in the U.S. Applicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \n \nAG & 8(f) partially applies because he has no interest in foreign property and he \nhas significant U.S. property and assets. AG & 8(f) does not fully apply because the \nSOR and record do not raise AG & 7(e).  Since becoming a U.S. citizen, he has voted in \nU.S. elections. These mitigating conditions taken together are sufficient to fully \novercome the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nThere is little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Likewise, because of his \nclose ties and his loyalties to the U.S., including his wife and five children (all U.S. born \ncitizens), he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran and the heavy burden \nan Applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country, such as Iran.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n11\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nIn 1975, Applicant came to the U.S. In 1992, he became a U.S. citizen and \nobtained a security clearance the following year. He has held a clearance more than 15 \nyears. However, merely having held a clearance is not in and of itself a reason to \ncontinue the retention of a clearance, but having been granted a clearance one must \nask what has changed since that grant. Applicant was a naturalized U.S. citizen then as \nhe is now. Then, he had foreign relatives consisting of his mother and four siblings. \nNow, he still has his siblings, but his closest relative, his mother has died. With her \ndeath, his communication with his four siblings has been reduced to one or two contacts \na year.  \n \nFollowing the grant of the clearance, he traveled to Iran four times and held an \nIranian passport. Now, he no longer travels to Iran and has surrendered the expired \nIranian passport to his FSO. He has no intention of ever returning to Iran. He chose not \nto return to Iran even for his mother\u2019s funeral. Then, he was divorced from a U.S. citizen \nand had three children. Now he is married to a U.S. citizen and has five children, all \nborn in the U.S. Then he had worked for his employer six years. Now he has worked for \nhis employer 21 years. Then, he had lived in the U.S. for 18 years. Now, he has lived \nhere for 33 years.  \n \nApplicant does not intent to return to Iran. His family, property, and future are in \nthe U.S. I have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I have \nconsidered the Iranian government\u2019s hostile relationship with the U.S. and unwillingness \nto comply with international law and respect the human rights of Iranians and former \nIranians. I find that there is little potential for Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or \nexploited because he has siblings living in Iran. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn October 12, 2006, Applicant executed and certified a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF-86). On November 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nApril 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n \nOn December 17, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. On February 17, 2009, the case was \nassigned to me. I convened a hearing on March 20, 2009, to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses, introduced five exhibits (Ex.), and \noffered for administrative notice facts about The Palestinian Territories and the West \nBank compiled from four official documents of the U.S. Government. (The five-page \ncompilation was identified as \u201cAdministrative Notice.\u201d The documents from which the \ncompilation was drawn were marked HE I through IV and included in the record.)  Ex.1 \nthrough 5 were received into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and called no witnesses. He offered no exhibits. At the conclusion of the hearing, \nI left the record open until close of business April 1, 2009, so that Applicant could, if he \nwished, submit additional documentation for the record. On April 1, 2009, Applicant \nadvised that he did not have any post-hearing documents to submit.  DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 27, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG B, Foreign \nInfluence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \nfour AG B allegations.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and applicable adjudicative guidelines, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old.  He was born and educated in the United States. He \nhas earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering and a Master of Science \ndegree in telecommunications. He seeks a security clearance as a senior information \nsecurity analyst employed by a government contractor.1 He does not, at present, have \naccess to classified information. (Ex. 1; Tr. 44-49.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in an area now identified as the West Bank of the \nPalestinian Territories. They immigrated to the United States and became U.S. citizens. \nApplicant and his four sisters were born in the United States. Applicant\u2019s father owned a \nrestaurant business.  (Ex.1; Tr. 53-56.) \n \n \nIn 1990, Applicant\u2019s mother left the United States and returned to live in the West \nBank with his four sisters. In 1995, Applicant\u2019s father retired from his business in the \nUnited States and joined his wife and daughters in the West Bank. Applicant\u2019s father, \nmother, and four sisters currently reside in the West Bank.  (Tr. 57-59.)    \n \n \n1 Applicant holds a second full-time position as a security operations center engineer with a company \nowed by a foreign entity. The U.S. company which employs Applicant as a federal contractor is \nsponsoring him for a security clearance. (Ex. 4; Tr. 47-48.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant traveled to the West Bank to visit his family and to discuss \nmarriage with his parents. In 2000, he traveled to the West Bank with his fianc\u00e9e and \nher family. He and his fianc\u00e9e were married in the West Bank village where his parents \nlive. Applicant\u2019s wife was born in the United States and is a U.S. citizen. Applicant and \nhis wife are first cousins. They are the parents of three young children. (Ex. 1; Tr. 41-43, \n50, 52, 94.) \n \n \nApplicant traveled to the West Bank in 2001 for the wedding of one of his sisters.  \nIn 2003, he and his wife traveled to the West Bank to introduce their infant daughter to \nhis family. In 2004, Applicant traveled twice to the West Bank for the weddings of two of \nhis sisters. In 2007, he traveled to the West Bank to introduce his family to his second \ndaughter and his son. He plans to travel to the West Bank in the future to visit his \nparents, sisters, and other family members there. (Tr. 42-43, 65.) \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s mother and sisters possess Palestinian identification and travel \ndocuments.  His father has also applied for and received approval from the Palestinian \nAuthority for such documentation.  Applicant\u2019s father, who is retired, collects U.S. social \nsecurity.  Applicant\u2019s mother is not employed outside the home. (Tr. 59, 63-64.) \n \n \nApplicant is his parents\u2019 only son. His oldest sister is a teacher. Her husband, \nwho is also a teacher, is a citizen and resident of the West Bank. The sister and her \nhusband have two children and reside with Applicant\u2019s parents in their home.  \nApplicant\u2019s youngest sister is divorced from her husband and also lives with Applicant\u2019s \nparents. Her former husband, a citizen and resident of the West Bank, is also a teacher. \n(Tr. 61, 69-72.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s third sister lives in a village in the West Bank with her husband and \nson. The husband, a citizen and resident of the West Bank, is a teacher. Applicant\u2019s \nfourth sister is separated from her husband, who lives in the United States. The fourth \nsister lives with Applicant\u2019s parents and is pursuing university studies.  (Tr. 66-67, 75.) \n \n \nApplicant possesses a U.S. checking account for the purpose of helping his \nparents with their living expenses. His father\u2019s monthly social security check is \ndeposited to the account, enabling Applicant to transfer the social security funds \nelectronically to his father in the West Bank. Each month Applicant also provides his \nmother with approximately $300 a month in support.  He estimates that he provides his \nparents and sisters with a total of approximately $5,000 to $6,000 in support each year. \nFor U.S. federal income purposes, Applicant claimed his mother and two of his sisters \nas dependents.  (Ex. 4; Tr. 76-77, 96-102.) \n \n   \nApplicant is close to his parents and his sisters.  He communicates with his \nsisters by e-mail, and he speaks with his parents by telephone once a week.  (Tr. 64, \n75.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about the Palestinian Territories, \nincluding the West Bank:2 \n \nPalestine is a territory, created following World War I, as the result of a \nBritish mandate. The territory included land that is within the current \nborders of Israel, Jordan, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. In 1948, the \nBritish withdrew from the Palestinian Territory and Jews proclaimed an \nindependent State of Israel.  Arabs living in the Palestinian territory moved \nto the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip, the Jordanian-ruled West Bank, \nJordan proper, Syria, and Lebanon.  The Palestinian Liberation \nOrganization (PLO) was established in 1964[,] and after 1967, became \nmore militant, portraying itself as a movement struggling for national \nliberation.  In time, the PLO became recognized by the Palestinian people, \nthe Arab states, and much of the international community as the legitimate \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people.  In 1967, Israel took control of the \nSinai and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem \nfrom Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.  The Arabs living within \nthis territory came under Israeli rule. The conflict between Arab \nPalestinians and Israel continued throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and \nincreased during the 1980s in uprisings called the First Intifada.  In 1988, \nJordan ceded all Jordanian claims to the territory.  In September 2005, \nIsrael completed its unilateral withdrawal from Gaza but still controls the \nflow of people and goods in and out of the territories and continues to \noccupy the West Bank, and has erected hundreds of checkpoints and \nroadblocks to thwart terrorism. \n \nFatah, a secular nationalist party and the largest faction within the PLO, \ndominated Palestinian society and politics between 1969, when its leader \nYasir Arafat became PLO chairman, and his death in 2004. In the January \n2006, Palestinian legislative election, an opposition party, Hamas, formed \na government without Fatah.  Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, \na religious and political organization founded in Egypt in 1928, with \nbranches throughout the Arab world. Hamas combines Palestinian \nnationalism with Islamic fundamentalism. Its founding charter commits the \ngroups to the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic \nstate in all of historic Palestine. It rejected the Oslo Accords, boycotted the \n1996 elections, and has waged an intermittent terrorist campaign to \nundermine the peace process.  Its military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Quassam \nBrigades, has carried out hundreds of terrorist attacks since 1993. The \n \n2 The facts contained in this summary were provided by Department Counsel and are derived from the \nfollowing documents: Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, The Palestinian Territories: \nBackground and U.S. Relations, July 5, 2007; U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human \nRights Practices \u2013 2007: Israel and the Occupied Territories, March 11, 2008, revised 2009; U.S. \nDepartment of State, Travel Warning, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, January 15, 2009; U.S. \nDepartment of State, Country Specific Information: Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, February 8, 2008.  \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nU.S. State Department has designated Hamas as a Foreign Terrorist \nOrganization (FTO). The U[nited] S[tates] has also designated six other \nPalestinian groups as FTOs. In February 2007, Hamas and Fatah signed \nan agreement to form a national unity government, with Hamas controlling \nthe Prime Minister position and nine ministries.  However, in June 2007, \nfactional fighting broke out and Hamas took complete control of the Gaza \nStrip. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Fatah retained \ncontrol over the West Bank. \n \nThe current security situation in the Palestinian Territories is such that the \nUnited States urges citizens to defer travel to the West Bank and to avoid \nall travel to the Gaza Strip due to threats to American citizens and U.S. \ninterests in those locations. All U.S. Government personnel and their \ndependents are prohibited from traveling to any cities, towns or \nsettlements in the West Bank, except when they are on mission-essential \nbusiness or are traveling for other mission-approved purposes.  Regarding \nPalestinian Authorities, there were reports of torture, arbitrary and \nprolonged detention, poor prison conditions, insufficient measures to \nprevent terroris[m] and corruption. U.S. citizens, including tourists, \nstudents, residents, and U.S. mission personnel, have been injured or \nkilled by terrorists in Israel, Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza. \nAdditionally, in the past, armed gunmen have kidnapped foreigners, \nincluding several Americans.  Gunmen in negotiations with the Palestinian \nAuthority have sometimes used foreign hostages as bartering tools.  The \nthreat of hostage-taking remains a primary concern for Americans and \nforeigners within the Gaza Strip.   \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative  judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s case requires the recognition that the Palestinian Authority has \nneither prevented nor disavowed terrorist actions hostile to the United States and that \nfactions within it support international terrorism.  Additionally, it does not deter internal \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfactions that oppose, through violence, U. S. policies such as the Middle East peace \nprocess and human rights.  These hostile actions by the Palestinian Authority directly \nthreaten U.S. security interests.  American citizens with immediate family members who \nare citizens or residents of the West Bank, which is under Palestinian Authority control, \ncould be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  \n \n \nI have reviewed the allegations in this case, and I have weighed them against the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under the Foreign Influence guideline. I conclude \nSOR \u00b61.c for Applicant, since it does not raise an independent disqualifying condition \nunder the guideline but simply supports the security concerns that arise from the \ncitizenship and residency of Applicant\u2019s parents and sisters, which are alleged at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n \nThe facts of this case raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(i). AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(i) reads: \u201cconduct, especially while \ntraveling outside the U.S., which may make an individual vulnerable to exploitation, \npressure, or coercion by a foreign group, government, or country.\u201d \n \nApplicant has immediate family members who reside in a foreign country.  \nApplicant is close to his parents and his four sisters, who are U.S. citizens living in the \nWest Bank, and he communicates with them regularly. He owns and manages a U.S. \nbank account to which his father\u2019s monthly social security payments are sent, and he \nregularly sends his mother and sisters money to help them with their living expenses. \n \n \nThe United States has designated Hamas and six other Palestinian organizations \nas FTOs. The FTOs and their activities create instability and hostility, situations that \nthreaten U.S. security interests. The presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members \nin the West Bank raises security concerns because their presence there could make \nApplicant vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a hostile foreign \ngovernment or by terrorist groups operating in the West Bank. \n \nApplicant has traveled to the West Bank to visit his family at least six times since \n1999. He intends to travel to the West Bank in the future to visit his family members \nliving there. Applicant\u2019s parents and sisters also exercise certain indicia of residency in \nthe West Bank and utilize Palestinian identification and travel documents.   \n \n \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s case.  \nIf \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply. If \u201ccontact or communication with \n\n \n8 \n \n \nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could \ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his father, mother, and four sisters is based on long-\nstanding family ties of affection and obligation.  Applicant is a dutiful son who looks after \nthe welfare of his parents and sisters. He is in frequent contact with them, and they rely \nupon him for their support. Applicant\u2019s parents and sisters have elected to reside in a \nterritory that presents serious dangers for U.S. citizens, thereby creating a heightened \nrisk that Applicant could be targeted for exploitation, pressure, or coercion by individuals \nor groups in the West Bank who might also threaten U.S. security interests. Applicant \ntravels to the West Bank regularly to visit his family members. Applicant failed to provide \ninformation to rebut or mitigate these security concerns.  I conclude that the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) are inapplicable. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n \nAdditionally, DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has held that in Guideline B cases \u201c[a] whole-\nperson analysis should include reasonable consideration of the situation and nature of \nthe country involved.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006).  The \nAppeal Board has also observed that \u201c[i]n Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the \nforeign government involved in the case, the intelligence gathering history of that \ngovernment, and the presence of terrorist activity is important evidence that provides \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncontext for the other evidence of record and must be brought to be brought to bear on \nthe judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-08560 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 10, 2006.)       \n \nAccordingly, I have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of the whole person concept and all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. Applicant is an adult of 37 years of age. He is highly educated in \nengineering and telecommunications.  He holds two full-time professional positions and \nprovides significant support for his parents and sisters living in the West Bank. He \nclaims his mother and two of his sisters as dependents for federal income tax purposes. \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members are U.S. citizens living in the West Bank, an area \nwith an active history of kidnapping and terrorism that targets U.S. citizens and \nthreatens U.S. security interests. Their presence in the West Bank could cause \nApplicant to be subject to coercion, pressure or exploitation by individuals in the West \nBank who threaten United States security interests.   \n \n Applicant is in weekly telephone contact with his parents. He communicates with \nhis four sisters in the West Bank by e-mail.  As a U.S. citizen, Applicant traveled to the \nWest Bank in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007 to visit his family. His frequent travel \nto the West Bank increases his exposure to the possibility of hostile actions by those \nwho target U.S. citizens and U.S. security interests.  \n \nApplicant is a dutiful son and brother and devoted to his family in the West Bank. \nHe provides his family with approximately $5,000 to $6,000 of support each year. He \nhas plans to visit his parents and sisters in the West Bank in the future, even though the \nU.S. State Department urges U.S. citizens to defer travel to the West Bank because of \nsecurity threats to American citizens and U.S. interests. Applicant\u2019s loyalty and \ncommitment to the support of his parents and sisters is admirable. However, it raises \nconcerns that his family commitments could cause conflicts in his ability to protect \nclassified information. \n \n Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 8, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\n\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding Guideline E.  The Judge\u2019s conclusions as to Guideline E are\n1\nnot in issue.\nThe Judge concluded, among other things, that although most of the delinquent accounts are no longer listed\n2\non Applicant\u2019s recent credit reports, it appears to be the result of the passage of time rather than Applicant\u2019s resolution\nof the debts.  Decision at 5.\n2\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 13, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issue: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old.  Her\nhusband recently retired from the United States Navy after 20 years of service.  Applicant and her\nhusband lived overseas from 2003 to 2006 due to her husband\u2019s service.  While overseas, Applicant\ncompleted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position in which she indicated that she did not have any\ndebts delinquent by 180 days, and later a Questionnaire for National Security Position in which she\nindicated that she did not have any debts delinquent by 90 or 180 days.  A background investigation\nrevealed that Applicant had 11 delinquent accounts, which had been placed for collection in 2004\nor earlier.  Applicant testified that she did not know she had any delinquent debts until she was\ninterviewed in connection with the investigation.  In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to\nsome of the debts and denied others.  In response to interrogatories, Applicant indicated that all her\ndelinquent accounts were closed or resolved because they no longer appear on her credit report, and\nshe submitted a credit report to that effect.  Applicant testified that she did not pay any of the debts.\nShe disputed some of the debts, but did not follow up with the credit reporting agencies.  All of\nApplicant\u2019s open accounts are current.  Applicant\u2019s husband testified to her trustworthiness.\nIn her appeal, Applicant primarily restates portions of the record evidence in an effort to rebut\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusions.   The appeal brief contains new evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s efforts to\n1\nresolve the debts listed in the SOR.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.29.       \nApplicant argues that she has mitigated any security concerns that might exist under\nGuideline F and that the Judge either did not consider or did not give adequate weight to her\nevidence of mitigation.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record\nevidence, unless the Judge specifically states otherwise; and there is no requirement that the Judge\nmention or discuss every piece of record evidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 04-08134 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2005).   Applicant admitted many of the SOR allegations\nagainst her.  The burden then shifted to Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns\nraised by those allegations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that Applicant did not present\nevidence sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised.   The application of disqualifying and\n2\n\n3\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does\nnot alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security determination.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2007). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.       \nSigned: Michael D.

Only the delinquent medical accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j are listed \non the most recent credit report offered by the Government, dated June 5, 2008. (Gov 7 \nat 7-8.) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that she has not paid the debts that she admits she \nowes and has not paid the debts that she denies. (Tr at 32, 60-72.) All of her open \naccounts are current. She and her husband are in the process of purchasing a new \nhome. (Tr at 19, 30, 33; AE B.) \n \nApplicant claims that she did not realize that she had delinquent debts until she \nwas interviewed in 2006 in conjunction with her background investigation. She had no \nintention to defraud the government by omitting her financial delinquencies on her \nsecurity clearance application. (Tr at 21-22; Gov 3 at 7.) She claims that she disputed \nsome of the delinquent accounts but has not followed up with the credit reporting \nagencies. (Tr at 54-55.)    \n \nIn 2006, just prior to her family\u2019s move back to the United States, Applicant \nconsulted a debt counselor. She did not find him helpful. (Tr at 49-51.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified that his wife is very trustworthy. He claims that she \nwas not aware of the delinquent accounts listed on the credit report. He is on terminal \nleave and is working for a government contractor. He retired at the grade of E-6. His \nmonthly salary in his new job is approximately $5,500 a month gross. He will get \napproximately $1,000 per month in his military retirement check. He contacted the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.k for his wife. He claims the creditor had no information that his wife \nhad an account. He acknowledges the account was not paid. (Tr at 77-90.) \n \nApplicant and her husband\u2019s current financial position is relatively stable. (Tr at   \n34-45, 89-90; Gov 3 at 8.)  In December 2005, their house was flooded. Their car was \ntotally destroyed and their downstairs furniture had suffered from water damage. (Tr at \n40-45.)     \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \n\n \n4 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n5 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant incurred 11 delinquent \naccounts from 1999 to 2004. The total approximate balance of the delinquent debt is \n$27,472. Of that amount, $23,442 relates to two automobile repossessions. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues appear to be the result of neglect rather than an inability to pay her \ndebts. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility is too recent to apply this mitigating \ncondition. Although most of the delinquent accounts are no longer listed on Applicant\u2019s \nrecent credit reports, it appears to be the result of the passage of time rather than \nApplicant resolving the debts.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Although Applicant\u2019s \nhousehold possessions were damaged in a flood in December 2005, the record does \nnot indicate that this was a huge setback for Applicant\u2019s finances. Most of the debts \nwere delinquent prior to Applicant and her family moving overseas.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Although Applicant attended a brief financial counseling \nsession, issues remain, because Applicant did not provide proof that she resolved any \nof the accounts. Rather, the accounts were taken off her credit report because they \nwere more than seven years old.  The removal of debts from a credit report does not \nmake them disappear as if they never existed or preclude the Judge from considering \nother record evidence that shows those debts exist. The security significance of \nApplicant\u2019s financial history does not turn on whether Applicant\u2019s debts could or could \nnot be legally listed on a credit report after the passage of seven years. ISCR Case and \nAppeal Board Decision, No. 02-14950 (May 15, 2003) at 4; see ISCR Case and Appeal \nBoard Decision 98-0111 (November 13, 1998) at 3.     \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant made minimal effort \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntowards resolving her delinquent accounts. While Applicant\u2019s current financial situation \nis relatively stable, her past neglect of her financial responsibilities remains an issue.  \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list her \ndelinquent debts in response to question 22.b on her application for a position of public \ntrust, signed on September 22, 2003, and in response to questions 28(a) and 28(b) on \nher security clearance application, dated July 29, 2005. The following Personal Conduct \nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC) potentially applies to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities). I find that it does not apply. Applicant states that she was not aware of \nthe delinquent debts until she was interviewed by an investigator conducting her \nbackground investigation in 2006.  I conclude her omission was not intentional. \n \n \nI find for Applicant under the Personal Conduct concern. \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial stability. However, I also considered Applicant\u2019s neglect of her past financial \nobligations. Applicant may have forgotten about these obligations but once she was \nreminded during her security background interview in 2006, she took minimal effort \ntowards resolving these accounts.  Applicant did not mitigate the concerns raised under \nfinancial considerations due to her past history of financial irresponsibility which raises \nconcerns about her trustworthiness and reliability.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On July 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 28, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Wilford H. Ross granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.   Department Counsel\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  Applicant filed a cross-appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.28.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the Guideline D and Guideline E mitigating conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s\nwhole-person analysis was in error.  Applicant raised the following issue on cross appeal: whether\nthe Judge erred in admitting certain pieces of documentary evidence.  Consistent with the following\ndiscussion, we reverse the decision of the Judge.\nFacts\nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a Defense contractor.  He seeks to retain his security\nclearance in connection with his employment.\nSeveral of the Guideline D allegations refer to Government Exhibit (GE) 7, a Decision Letter\nfrom another Government agency denying Applicant access to classified information.1  GE 7 was\nsigned by a Senior Adjudication Officer, and the Judge quoted it in pertinent part:\nDuring your most recent security testing, you divulged information regarding your\nviewing pornography of underage girls around 14 to 16 years old.  You mentioned\nyou had seen some pornography of girls as young as 11 years old, which you found\non foreign web sites.  You admitted that, although you believe your actions are\nillegal, you have deliberately sought and viewed pornographic images of underage\ngirls for several years, and you continue to do so on an average of twice weekly; you\nlook at pornographic thumbnails of underage girls that appear interesting and\ndownload them to a temporary file in your computer.  You also admitted that you\nactively seek and view what you believe to be rapes of 15 or 16-year-old girls (in\nsome cases by multiple persons), and teenage females involved in sexual acts or\nbeing molested; and, you sexually gratify yourself while viewing these images.\nAdditionally, you admitted that you have recurring rape fantasies and your greatest\ninterest involves the rape of 12-year-old girls.  You stated that during a work related\noverseas trip you were involved in two sexual encounters with girls you believed to\nbe 15 or 16 years old; that it was your intention to do so prior to your trip; and, the\nencounters enabled you to live out part of your sexual/rape fantasies with young girls\nin a more permissive environment.\n\n2The Judge also found that Applicant had denied SOR allegations to the effect that (1) he became physically\naroused when one of his daughter\u2019s swim team members rubbed against him and (2) when his daughter\u2019s high school\nfriends would stay overnight at his house, he could identify which of the girls wore bras.  Concerning the swim team\nincidents, Applicant stated that the swimmers approached him and that he should have confronted them or had the team\ncaptain talk to them about their behavior.  Concerning the sleepover allegation, he stated that the young girls \u201cflaunted\ntheir bodies as a tease.  I did not make any type of move or approach them in any way.\u201d  Decision at 4-5.\n3The information in question is contained in the Judge\u2019s quotation from GE 7, above.\n3\nThe Judge found that Applicant had denied deliberately seeking child pornography on the\ninternet, stating instead that he had accidentally viewed such material \u201conce or twice\u201d several years\nprior to 2003.  Applicant stated that he had not viewed child pornography for over six years.  He\noffered Government officials an opportunity to examine the hard drive of his computer.\nApplicant claimed that two child prostitutes approached him in Taiwan on two different\nnights, but he rebuffed their advances.  He denied ever having had sexual intercourse with the\nprostitutes.\nApplicant denied an allegation that he had masturbated in front of his prepubescent nephews\nwhen he was 17 years old.  He stated that on one occasion 40 years prior his nephews had asked him\nquestions about masturbation.  \u201cI simply showed them on myself.\u201d2  Decision at 5.\nUnder Guideline E, the Judge found that Applicant had previously been disapproved for\nadditional access to classified information by another Government agency.  Applicant appealed the\ndecision, but it was affirmed.  He also found that Applicant\u2019s security access was denied and his\nclearance revoked because of information he provided the other Government agency.3\nApplicant denied an allegation under Guideline E that he had falsified an affidavit during the\ncourse of his security clearance investigation in 2008, specifically by stating that on one occasion\nhe had accidentally viewed \u201can inappropriate image,\u201d deliberately leaving out the information\ncontained in GE 7.  \n  \nThe Judge found that the Government had presented no information to support an allegation\nthat he had provided a false answer to DOHA interrogatories on October 17, 2008, by stating that\nhe had never had an extramarital affair of any kind and had only talked to the two underage\nprostitutes referenced above.\nThe Judge found that Applicant denied two other allegations of false statements contained\nin interrogatories he executed on July 2, 2008.  The first of these alleged that he falsely denied that\nhe had had sexual intercourse with two underage prostitutes in Taiwan.  The second alleged that he\nhad falsely denied deliberately viewing child pornography.\nApplicant enjoys a good reputation for trustworthiness, for his moral character, and his\nprofessionalism.\n\n4GE 7 was not prepared on letterhead stationary by the other agency.  Applicant contends that it lacks indicia\nof authenticity.  However, in GE 1, Security Clearance Application (SCA), Applicant states that, in 2004, he was denied\naccess to classified information by a named Government agency.  GE 7 bears a date of February 2004.  GE 2,\nApplicant\u2019s appeal of the decision to deny him a clearance, was clearly prepared in reference to GE 7. Moreover, in GE\n1, Applicant states that the denial by the other agency was \u201c[c]urrently under appeal.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s appeal of the other\nagency\u2019s denial was finally decided in November 2006, after the date of his SCA.  Aside from this other Government\nagency and DOHA, there is no evidence in the record of any other agency agency denying Applicant a clearance.\n4\n Discussion   \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nCross-Appeal\nApplicant contends that GE 7 was not admissible under the provisions of the Directive or\nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence.  As stated above, this exhibit is a Decision Statement by\nanother Government agency concerning the agency\u2019s clearance investigation of Applicant.4 \n\nAccordingly, the record supports a conclusion that GE 7 is the denial letter by the agency named by Applicant in GE\n1.  The record provides no reasonable basis to deny the authenticity of GE 7.  \n5\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20 provides that \n[o]fficial records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of business,\nother than DoD personnel background reports of investigation (ROI), may be\nreceived and considered by the Administrative Judge without authenticating\nwitnesses, provided that such information has been furnished by an investigative\nagency pursuant to its responsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of\nDefense, or the Department or Agency head concerned, to safeguard classified\ninformation . . . An ROI may be received with an authenticating witness provided it\nis otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence[.] (internal citations\nomitted)   \nWe have recently held that a Clearance Decision Statement is admissible as substantive\nevidence under this provision of the Directive.  Because a Clearance Decision Statement is not an\nROI, it may be admitted without an authenticating witness.  ISCR Case No. 08-06997 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMar. 1, 2011).  Accordingly, we conclude that the Judge did not err by admitting GE 7.  \nApplicant also raises an issue concerning GE 4, which contains his answers to DOHA\ninterrogatories.  He draws attention to the following statement by the Judge in the Analysis portion\nof the decision: \u201c[GE] 4 . . . the DOHA interrogatories . . . are statements of fact, evidently drawn\nfrom other documents.\u201d Applicant contends that the Judge erred by considering the interrogatory\nquestions themselves as substantive evidence.  We agree with Applicant that the interrogatory\nquestions themselves are not evidence.  It is Applicant\u2019s answers to those questions that constitute\nevidence.  As Applicant notes, the \u201c\u2018questions\u2019 should be considered for the limited purpose of\ngiving context to [A]pplicant\u2019s statements in response to the interrogatories.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Cross-\nAppeal Brief at 5.  To the extent that the Judge\u2019s comment suggests that he considered the questions\nthemselves to be evidence, he erred.  However, in his findings of fact the Judge referenced transcript\ntestimony, Applicant\u2019s answers to interrogatories, and other documents properly admitted.  His\nmaterial findings of security concern, therefore, were based upon admissible evidence.  Any error\nimplicated by the comment quoted above is harmless.\nGovernment\u2019s Appeal\nThe Judge properly concluded that the Government had met its burden of production under\nGuideline D.   However, the Government contends that the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating\nconditions was in error.  She argues that the Judge\u2019s decision does not take into account significant\ncontrary record evidence.  This argument is persuasive.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had two sexual encounters in Taiwan with prostitutes he\nbelieved to be 15 or 16 years old.  This allegation is supported by the final quoted sentence from GE\n7, contained in the Findings section above.  GE 7 is a document prepared by a Government agency\n\n5See, e.g., Rothstein, Federal Rules of Evidence, Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to Rule 804(b)(3): \u201cThe\ncircumstantial guaranty of reliability for declarations against interest is the assumption that persons do not make\nstatements which are damaging to themselves unless satisfied for good reason that they are true.\u201d   \n6\nin the ordinary course of business.  It reflects statements Applicant made during interviews\nconnected with polygraph examinations.  These statements are against his interest, which enhances\ntheir credibility.5  Moreover, GE 8 and GE 9 are documents prepared by the same agency in\nresponse to Applicant\u2019s request for review.  GE 9 states, in pertinent part, \u201cAfter reviewing the\ninformation you provided in your appeal letters, as well as all information that led to the original\nsecurity decision, a panel of senior officers upheld the original security decision.\u201d  Federal agencies\nare entitled to a presumption of good faith and regularity in the performance of their responsibilities.\nSierra Club v. Costle, 657 F.2d 298, 334 (D.C. Cir. 1981).  Applicant presented no evidence to\ndemonstrate or suggest a motive for the agency to have misrepresented his statements to the\ninterviewer and then to have twice affirmed that decision.  He failed to rebut the presumption of\ngood faith and regularity.  \nThis allegation is further supported by GE 2, Applicant\u2019s request for a review of the other\nGovernment agency\u2019s decision to deny him a clearance.  In this document, Applicant states:\nThe two encounters with the girls overseas were not preplanned.  They just\nhappened!  At the time they occurred, I also did not believe they were 15 or 16, they\njust looked that young.  Since that time (January 1999), I have not had any type of\na relation with anyone other than my wife.\nGE 2 corroborates the pertinent language of GE 7 to the effect that Applicant engaged in sexual\nactivity with underage girls while in a foreign country.  By contrast, Applicant\u2019s presentation at the\nhearing, which the Judge summarized in Findings of Fact, was inconsistent with his statement in GE\n2, and a reasonable person could find it to be self-serving.  Applicant\u2019s interrogatory answers and\nhearing testimony clearly express an interest in sexual acts involving children, which tend to\ncorroborate GE 2 and 7.  Moreover, this incident bears a factual similarity to the allegations\naddressed in footnote 2 above.  The Judge does not discuss the extent to which Applicant\u2019s evidence\nthat he, a 55 year-old man, frequently has to ignore or rebuff sexual advances by underage girls may\nbe lacking in credibility.  The record does not support a conclusion that Applicant had mitigated\nsecurity concern arising from this incident.    \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant had admitted to the other agency that he had sought and\nviewed child pornography and that he had done so on an average of twice weekly.  It also alleged\nthat he had sought and viewed pornography depicting the rape and molestation of underage girls.\nThese allegations are supported by GE 7, which is corroborated to a certain extent by Applicant\u2019s\nown admission that he had actually viewed child pornography on his home computer, albeit\n\n6\u201cQ: So, you have viewed material with respect to 18-year olds and older being molested while you sexually\ngratify yourself?  A: Fantasy, ma\u2019am.  Role playing.  Q: How do you know the girls are 18? . . .  A:  Estimate.  Just\nassumption.\u201d  Tr. at 115. \n7\ninnocently.  It is also corroborated by Applicant\u2019s testimony concerning his interest in material\ndepicting the molestation of young females.6  \nThe Judge appeared to have accepted Applicant\u2019s denial of having purposely viewed child\npornography.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s testimony\nregarding Guideline D was consistent with his prior written statements.  Decision at 9.  However,\nas Department Counsel states in her brief, Applicant\u2019s denials actually contain significant\ninconsistencies.  In GE 6, an affidavit by Applicant dated April 2008, he stated:  \nMany years ago, I cannot recall the date, I was [learning] how to use the internet and\nwas on a news group.  These news groups are not moderated and anyone can post\nanything they want.  I accidentally came across an inappropriate image.  I\nimmediately left the site and have never gone into any of those news groups.\n  However, in GE 4, his Answers to Interrogatories, he stated that: \nwhile browsing through what appeared to be legal . . . adult pornographic material\nresiding on a U.S. Internet Service Provider . . . there were several occasions when\nI inadvertently viewed material relating to underage girls. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the Hearing is similar.  \u201cI told them that I inadvertently viewed [child\npornography] several times on the internet.\u201d  Tr. at 95.  Applicant\u2019s various statements are\ninconsistent both as to the frequency with which he viewed child pornography and as to the\nunderlying circumstances.  \nAdditionally, GE 4 contains the following interrogatory question: \nDuring an interview with another government agency in August 2003, you also\nstated that you viewed internet videos involving young teens engaging in sexual acts\nand that you masturbated to these videos.  Is this information correct?  \nApplicant replied, \u201cYes.  Further Explanation: the video participants appeared to be underage, but\nwere in actuality 18 or more years in age.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s admission that he sought out internet sites\ndepicting sexual acts involving girls who appeared to be underage is not totally consistent with his\nstatement in GE 6 that he had viewed \u201can inappropriate image\u201d only once by accident.  This\ninterrogatory answer most reasonably suggests purposeful activity occurring on more than one\noccasion.  Moreover, this answer corroborates GE 7 to a substantial degree.  \nApplicant\u2019s inconsistent statements undermine the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.  These\ninconsistent statements buttress Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge substituted a\n\n7Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 14(a): \u201cthe behavior occurred . . . during adolescence and there is no evidence of\nsubsequent conduct of a similar nature[.]\u201d  \n8\nfavorable impression of Applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-\n23504 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, 2007).  Viewed as a whole, the record does not support the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable application of the mitigating conditions to allegations that Applicant had purposely viewed\nchild pornography. \nConcerning the allegation that, as a teenager, Applicant had masturbated in front of his\nyoung nephews, the Judge appears to have extended favorable application to mitigating condition\n14(a).7  However, the record evidence of Applicant\u2019s viewing child pornography and having sex\nwith underage prostitutes constitutes subsequent conduct of a similar nature, i.e., sexual acts\ninvolving children.  The Judge\u2019s favorable application of this mitigating condition, as well as his\ntreatment of the remaining allegations under Guideline D, are not sustainable.\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s having been denied a clearance by the other\nagency due to information he provided concerning his sexual activities.  In addition, the SOR alleged\nfalse statements by Applicant.  One such statement was alleged to be contained in a set of DOHA\ninterrogatories dated October 2008.  As the Judge noted, there are no interrogatories with that date\ncontained in the file.  The Judge\u2019s favorable decision regarding this allegation is sustainable.  \nOtherwise, the SOR alleged false statements concerning Applicant\u2019s viewing of child\npornography and his sexual acts with underage prostitutes.  These statements are found in GE 6,\nApplicant\u2019s affidavit, and GE 4, his July 2008 interrogatory answers.  The Judge concluded that\nApplicant did not make false statements and, therefore, that the Government did not meet its burden\nof production:    \n[W]e are faced with the situation where the alleged false statements of the Applicant\nare where he disagrees with factual conclusions in Government Exhibits 4 and 7.\nSince, as discussed above, I cannot find with any degree of confidence that the\nconclusions in the documents are accurate, the Applicant\u2019s denials cannot be seen\nas false.  Decision at 10.    \nThe Judge appears to conclude that the Government did not present substantial evidence of\ndeliberate falsifications by Applicant, insofar as the Judge viewed the pertinent portions of GE 7 as\nconclusory in nature.  However, the statements attributed to Applicant in GE 7 do not appear to be\nconclusions but, on the contrary, appear to be statements of  fact, representing what Applicant said\nto interviewers during the course of his security clearance investigation.  Applicant\u2019s alleged\nfalsifications concern the very same activity that formed the basis of several of the Guideline D\nsecurity concerns\u2013Applicant\u2019s having viewed child pornography and having engaged in sex acts\nwith child prostitutes.  As we concluded above, these allegations are supported by the record.\nIndeed, the Judge\u2019s statement that he has no confidence in the reliability of the Government\u2019s\nevidence is not consistent with his own previous conclusion under Guideline D that the allegations\nwere in fact founded upon substantial record evidence.  Moreover, despite the Judge\u2019s\n\n8Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).\n9\ncharacterization of Applicant\u2019s denials, they are factually specific and cannot reasonably be\nattributed to a mere difference of opinion.  For example, Applicant\u2019s statement in GE 6, that he had\ninadvertently come across an image of child pornography once by accident, is not a statement of\nopinion.  Rather, it asserts purported facts.  Insofar as these purported facts are not consistent with\nother evidence that Applicant sought out sexually provocative images of young girls on several\noccasions, a reasonable person could conclude that the statement in GE 6 is neither an honest\nmistake or difference of opinion but a deliberate falsification. \nIn sum, the SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant specifically denied allegations of\nsexual misconduct that were supported by record evidence.  Accordingly, the Government met its\nburden of production under Guideline E that Applicant deliberately provided false information\nconcerning (1) his viewing of child pornography and (2) his sexual encounters with underage\nprostitutes.  The record, viewed as a whole, does not support a conclusion that Applicant met his\nburden of persuasion as to mitigation of the Guideline E security concerns.  The Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision under Guideline E is not sustainable.  \nIn light of the discussion above, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision fails to consider an\nimportant aspect of the case and offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the\nweight of the record evidence.  ISCR Case No. 03-22861, supra.  The record does not support the\nJudge\u2019s treatment of the mitigating conditions or the whole-person factors.  Considering the standard\nset forth in Egan, supra, and the Directive\u2019s requirement that any doubt concerning an Applicant\u2019s\naccess to classified information be resolved in favor of national security,8 the Judge\u2019s favorable\nsecurity clearance decision is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.       \n   \nSigned: Michael Y.

    "judges_findings_of_fact": "the Judge referenced transcript testimony, Applicant\u2019s answers to interrogatories, and other documents properly admitted. His material findings of security concern, therefore, were based upon admissible evidence. Any error implicated by the comment quoted above is harmless. Government\u2019s Appeal The Judge properly concluded that the Government had met its burden of production under Guideline D. However, the Government contends that the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions was in error. She argues that the Judge\u2019s decision does not take into account significant contrary record evidence. This argument is persuasive. The SOR alleged that Applicant had two sexual encounters in Taiwan with prostitutes he believed to be 15 or 16 years old. This allegation is supported by the final quoted sentence from GE 7, contained in the Findings section above. GE 7 is a document prepared by a Government agency 5See, e.g., Rothstein, Federal Rules of Evidence, Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to Rule 804(b)(3): \u201cThe circumstantial guaranty of reliability for declarations against interest is the assumption that persons do not make statements which are damaging to themselves unless satisfied for good reason that they are true.\u201d 6 in the ordinary course of business. It reflects statements Applicant made during interviews connected with polygraph examinations. These statements are against his interest, which enhances their credibility.5 Moreover, GE 8 and GE 9 are documents prepared by the same agency in response to Applicant\u2019s request for review. GE 9 states, in pertinent part, \u201cAfter reviewing the information you provided in your appeal letters, as well as all information that led to the original security decision, a panel of senior officers upheld the original security decision.\u201d Federal agencies are entitled to a presumption of good faith and regularity in the performance of their responsibilities. Sierra Club v. Costle, 657 F.2d 298, 334 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Applicant presented no evidence to demonstrate or suggest a motive for the agency to have misrepresented his statements to the interviewer and then to have twice affirmed that decision. He failed to rebut the presumption of good faith and regularity. This allegation is further supported by GE 2, Applicant\u2019s request for a review of the other Government agency\u2019s decision to deny him a clearance. In this document, Applicant states: The two encounters with the girls overseas were not preplanned. They just happened! At the time they occurred, I also did not believe they were 15 or 16, they just looked that young. Since that time (January 1999), I have not had any type of a relation with anyone other than my wife. GE 2 corroborates the pertinent language of GE 7 to the effect that Applicant engaged in sexual activity with underage girls while in a foreign country. By contrast, Applicant\u2019s presentation at the hearing, which the Judge summarized in Findings of Fact, was inconsistent with his statement in GE 2, and a re",

He seeks to retain his security clearance in connection with his employment. Several of the Guideline D allegations refer to Government Exhibit (GE) 7, a Decision Letter from another Government agency denying Applicant access to classified information.1 GE 7 was signed by a Senior Adjudication Officer, and the Judge quoted it in pertinent part: During your most recent security testing, you divulged information regarding your viewing pornography of underage girls around 14 to 16 years old. You mentioned you had seen some pornography of girls as young as 11 years old, which you found on foreign web sites. You admitted that, although you believe your actions are illegal, you have deliberately sought and viewed pornographic images of underage girls for several years, and you continue to do so on an average of twice weekly; you look at pornographic thumbnails of underage girls that appear interesting and download them to a temporary file in your computer. You also admitted that you actively seek and view what you believe to be rapes of 15 or 16-year-old girls (in some cases by multiple persons), and teenage females involved in sexual acts or being molested; and, you sexually gratify yourself while viewing these images. Additionally, you admitted that you have recurring rape fantasies and your greatest interest involves the rape of 12-year-old girls. You stated that during a work related overseas trip you were involved in two sexual encounters with girls you believed to be 15 or 16 years old; that it was your intention to do so prior to your trip; and, the encounters enabled you to live out part of your sexual/rape fantasies with young girls in a more permissive environment. 2The Judge also found that Applicant had denied SOR allegations to the effect that (1) he became physically aroused when one of his daughter\u2019s swim team members rubbed against him and (2) when his daughter\u2019s high school friends would stay overnight at his house, he could identify which of the girls wore bras. Concerning the swim team incidents, Applicant stated that the swimmers approached him and that he should have confronted them or had the team captain talk to them about their behavior. Concerning the sleepover allegation, he stated that the young girls \u201cflaunted their bodies as a tease. I did not make any type of move or approach them in any way.\u201d Decision at 4-5. 3The information in question is contained in the Judge\u2019s quotation from GE 7, above. 3 The Judge found that Applicant had denied deliberately seeking child pornography on the internet, stating instead that he had accidentally viewed such material \u201conce or twice\u201d several years prior to 2003. Applicant stated that he had not viewed child pornography for over six years. He offered Government officials an opportunity to examine the hard drive of his computer. Applicant claimed that two child prostitutes approached him in Taiwan on two different nights, but he rebuffed their advances. He denied ever having had sexual intercourse with the prostitutes. Applicant denied an allegation that he had masturbated in front of his prepubescent nephews when he was 17 years old. He stated that on one occasion 40 years prior his nephews had asked him questions about masturbation. \u201cI simply showed them on myself.\u201d2 Decision at 5. Under Guideline E, the Judge found that Applicant had previously been disapproved for additional access to classified information by another Government agency. Applicant appealed the decision, but it was affirmed. He also found that Applicant\u2019s security access was denied and his clearance revoked because of information he provided the other Government agency.3 Applicant denied an allegation under Guideline E that he had falsified an affidavit during the course of his security clearance investigation in 2008, specifically by stating that on one occasion he had accidentally viewed \u201can inappropriate image,\u201d deliberately leaving out the information contained in GE 7. The Judge found that the Government had presented no information to support an allegation that he had provided a false answer to DOHA interrogatories on October 17, 2008, by stating that he had never had an extramarital affair of any kind and had only talked to the two underage prostitutes referenced above. The Judge found that Applicant denied two other allegations of false statements contained in interrogatories he executed on July 2, 2008. The first of these alleged that he falsely denied that he had had sexual intercourse with two underage prostitutes in Taiwan. The second alleged that he had falsely denied deliberately viewing child pornography. Applicant enjoys a good reputation for trustworthiness, for his moral character, and his professionalism. 4GE 7 was not prepared on letterhead stationary by the other agency.

Daniel Lynch, Esquire\nOctober 28, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions on October\n5, 2006. (Government Exhibit 1.) On June 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 27, 2009, and requested a hearing .\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 25, 2009. This case was\nassigned to me on September 28, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October\n19, 2009, setting the hearing for November 6, 2009. Applicant\u2019s counsel requested a\n\nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of Government Exhibits 2, 3, 5 and 8. Those objections were\n1\noverruled and the exhibits admitted.

The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were\nadmitted.  Applicant testified, called three additional witnesses, and submitted Applicant\n1\nExhibits A through E, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing on January 4, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 55 and married. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that is illegal, reflects a lack of\njudgment or discretion, or may subject Applicant to undue influence or coercion.\nApplicant denied all the allegations under this paragraph. Several of the allegations refer\nto Government Exhibit 7, which is the Decision Letter (DL) of Another Government\nAgency (AGA) concerning the Applicant\u2019s access to classified information, dated\nFebruary 2004. This letter was signed by a Senior Adjudication Officer, who was not the\ninterviewer or polygrapher of the Applicant. In pertinent part the DL says:\nDuring your most recent security testing, you divulged information\nregarding your viewing pornography of underage girls around 14 to 16\nyears old. You mentioned you had seen some pornography of girls as\nyoung as 11 years old, which you had found on foreign web sites. You\nadmitted that, although you believe your actions are illegal, you have\ndeliberately sought and viewed pornographic images of underage girls for\nseveral years, and you continue to do so on an average of twice weekly;\nyou look at pornographic thumbnails of underage girls that appear\ninteresting and download them to a temporary file in your computer.

You stated that during a work\nrelated overseas trip your were involved in two sexual encounters with\n\nThe phrase \u201csexual encounters\u201d is not defined anywhere in the DL.\n2\nApplicant stated that no written statement was made after any of his interviews with the AGA.

No other evidence was submitted concerning the content of these interviews.\n3\ngirls you believed to be 15 or 16 years old;  that it was your intention to do\n2\nso prior to your trip; and, the encounters enabled you to live out part of\nyour sexual/rape fantasies with young girls in a more permissive\nenvironment. (Government Exhibit 7 at 1-2.)3\n1.a.  Applicant denied that during two interviews with AGA in 2003 he admitted\nthat he deliberately sought and viewed child pornography on an average of twice\nweekly. As stated above, Government Exhibit 7 is the only support for this allegation.\nApplicant admits that he has accidentally viewed child pornography on several\noccasions. This was in relation to his working with use net newsgroups on the internet,\nor when looking at what he thought was legal pornography. \nIn a letter he sent in response to Government Exhibit 7, dated March 16, 2004,\nApplicant stated:\nWhen your representatives asked me whether or not I had viewed\nthis type of material, I had to answer \u201cyes\u201d. However, I have not\ndeliberately sought out the type of material in question. The two questions\nin my mind are still: How do I report this type of inappropriate information\nto the proper authorities, and if I do, will I some how become a \u201cguilty\u201d\nperson while trying to do the right thing? I have also stated my concerns\non this issue during both of my interviews with your representatives.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 1.) (See Government Exhibit 4 at 2, 8, and\nExhibit 6 at 1-2.)\nIn his testimony, Applicant specifically denied deliberately seeking child\npornography on the internet up to twice weekly for several years. He additionally said\nthat he accidentally looked at pornographic pictures of children only once or twice,\nseveral years before 2003. He further stated that he has not viewed any type of child\npornography in over six years. (Government Exhibit 4 at 10.) Finally, Applicant stated\nthat he has offered to the AGA and the Defense Department the opportunity to examine\nall of his computers, with or without a warrant. (Transcript at 95-99, 118-119, 135-136,\n138-141.)\n1.b. Applicant denied this allegation, which states he specifically sought and\nviewed pornography involving the rapes of 15 and/or 16-year-old girls, as well as\nteenage girls being molested. Once again, Government Exhibit 7 is the only support for\nthe statement.\n1.c. Applicant also denied this allegation, which alleges that he admitted to the\nAGA that he had recurring rape fantasies involving underage girls. \n\nThis included looking at videos of rape scenarios involving women who were at or above legal age.\n4\n(Government Exhibit 4 at 2-3, 8-9.)\nThere is no evidentiary support in the record for the conclusionary statements made in Government Exhibit\n5\n4, questions 7 and 8.\n4\nRegarding these allegations, the Applicant admits that he and his wife looked into\nways to enhance the marital relationship. He stated, \u201cSo, we looked at role playing,\nwhether it was rape fantasies, body submission, master/slave, whatever. We tried it a\ncouple of times, and said it\u2019s not for us and just didn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d (Transcript at 86-\n87.) (See Transcript at 99, 114-117.)  He specifically denied saying anything to the AGA\n4\nabout looking for rapes of 14 to 16 year-old-children on the internet, or ever doing such\na thing. (Transcript at 142-143.)\n1.d. Applicant denied having sexual encounters in January 1999 with two\nprostitutes in an Asian nation who he believed to be 15 or 16 years old. As before,\nGovernment Exhibit 7 is the sole support for this statement.\nApplicant testified extensively about these incidents. He states that the\nprostitutes approached him, one each on two different nights. Their advances to him\nwere rebuffed. In his testimony, Applicant admits that his written statement to the AGA\nabout these incidents was confusing. (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.) Applicant states, \u201cI\ndid not have sexual relations with anybody. I have never been unfaithful to my wife in 27\nyears of marriage.\u201d (Transcript at 88-90, 119-125.) He had specifically denied the\nstatements in the Interrogatories presented to him by DOHA that he had sexual\nintercourse with the prostitutes. (Government Exhibit 4 at 4, 9.)  \n5\n1.e. Applicant denied becoming physically aroused when one of his daughter\u2019s\nswim team members rubbed against him. \nThis allegation comes from Applicant\u2019s answer to question 11 of the July 2, 2009\ninterrogatories. He was asked whether it was true that, \u201cDuring your April 2003\ninterview, you further stated that on occasion you became physically aroused when one\nof the female teenage swimmers would rub against you. You further stated that you\nbelieved the girls (who were 16 to 17 years old) were flirty and dressed provocatively.\u201d\nHe answered, \u201cYes. Further explanation: The swimmers in question approached me on\nthe swim deck - I did not approach them. In hind sight, I should have either confronted\nthem myself or had the team captains talk to them about the situation.\u201d (Government\nExhibit 4 at 5, 10.) In his testimony, Applicant clarified this statement to say that it was\none swimmer on a single occasion. (Transcript at 90-92, 126-130.) \n1.f. Applicant denied this allegation, which stated that, when his daughter\u2019s high\nschool friends would stay overnight, that he could identify which of the girls wore bras.\nThis particular allegation comes from the Applicant\u2019s answer to question 12 of the\nJuly 2, 2009 interrogatories. After admitting that this statement was true, he further\nstated, \u201cThey flaunted their bodies as a tease. I did not make any type of move or\n\nThe security significance of this particular conduct, which occurred almost 40 years ago, is minimal.\n6\n(Transcript at 134-135.)\n5\napproach them in any way. In fact, I isolated myself from them to avoid being placed in\na compromising situation. I knew my daughter valued their friendship and I did not want\nto hurt her in any way.\u201d (See Transcript at 92-93, 130-132.) \n1.g. Applicant denied this allegation, which states that at the age of 17, he\nmasturbated himself in front of his nephews, who were 5 and 6 at the time.6\nThis particular allegation comes from the Applicant\u2019s answer to question 9 of the\nJuly 2, 2009 interrogatories. He stated:\nThis occurred one time only approximately 40 years ago and has\nnot happened again. In fact, I did not touch them nor did they touch me. I\nsimply showed them on myself. They had asked questions about sex and\nmasturbation after they had looked at several of their father\u2019s men\u2019s\nmagazines. I did feel extreme guilt afterward and still feel this guilt to this\nday as I realized it was totally inappropriate. I intended to clarify this issue\nwith the OGA during the next interview which did not take place.\n(Government Exhibit 4 at 5, 9-10.) (See Transcript at 93-95, 132-135.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in conduct which displays questionable judgment,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n2.a. and 2.b. Applicant admitted that the AGA disapproved his request for access\nfor additional classified information, and revoked his current access, in January 2004.\nHe appealed this decision, but the decision was reaffirmed on November 27, 2006. The\nreasons for this action are the factual allegations set forth in subparagraphs 1.a. through\n1.d. of the SOR. (Government Exhibits 7, 8 and 9.)\n2.c. Applicant denied this allegation, which regards statements executed by him\nand presented to an investigator with the Office of Personnel Management. He states in\nthat affidavit that he \u201caccidentally came across an inappropriate image\u201d and\n\u201cimmediately left the site.\u201d (Government Exhibit 6 at 1-2.) The veracity of this statement\nwill be discussed under \u201cAnalysis,\u201d below.\n2.d. Applicant denied this allegation, which refers to alleged statements in a set\nof interrogatories executed by him on October 17, 2008. This set of interrogatories was\nnot presented as an exhibit at the hearing. Based on his denial, and the lack of any\ncorroborating evidence, this allegation is found for the Applicant.\n\n6\n2.e. and 2.f. Applicant denied these allegations, which refer to questions in the\nJuly 2, 2009 interrogatories. Specifically, questions concerning the incidents with the\ntwo prostitutes in Asia and whether he intentionally viewed child pornography.\n(Government Exhibit 4.) The Government alleges that his answers were false when he\ndenied these allegations. The veracity of his statements will be discussed in \u201cAnalysis,\u201d\nbelow.\nMitigation\nTwo retired police officers, and a friend of the Applicant, testified for him. Each of\nthese witnesses knew about the allegations involving the Applicant\u2019s alleged viewing of\nchild pornography. Each of the witnesses finds the Applicant to be trustworthy and\nrecommend that he retain his security clearance. (Transcript at 31-67.) (See Applicant\nExhibit A at 11.)\nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from his wife, son and daughter.\n(Applicant Exhibit A at 2, 5-8, Exhibit B.) In addition, he also submitted letters of\nrecommendation from work associates, including a Captain in the US Air Force. They\ndescribe the Applicant as \u201cprofessional and diligent,\u201d \u201ca real asset,\u201d and to be of \u201chigh\nmoral character.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4, 9-10, 12-13.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own\ncommon sense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n7\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior)\nThe security concern for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion,\nor which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse\ninference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely\non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nThe Government has presented enough evidence to barely meet their burden of\nproof, which is minimal. The following disqualifying conditions are arguably applicable\nbased on this finding:\n13.a. sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the\nindividual has been prosecuted;\n\n8\n13.b. a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual\nbehavior that the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n13.c. sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation or duress;\n13.d. sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of\ndiscretion or judgment.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, all of the mitigating conditions have some\napplication. They are:\n14.a. the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and\nthere is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;\n14.b. the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or\nunder such circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n14.c. the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion,\nexploitation, or duress;\n14.d. the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and\ndiscreet.\nThe first question to be asked in this case is what exactly did the Applicant do?\nTwo government documents declare that, before the year 2003, he engaged in a\nserious, and possibly illegal, course of conduct regarding underage girls. This conduct\nconsisted of looking at graphic and violent pornography involving underage girls, and on\ntwo occasions engaging in sexual intercourse with underage prostitutes while overseas.\nAs stated, now that this finding has been made, the burden falls to the Applicant to\nrefute or mitigate it. \nThe problem in this case is that the documents supporting the factual allegations\nare third hand statements. Government Exhibits 4 and 7, the DOHA interrogatories and\nthe DL by the AGA, are statements of fact, evidently drawn from other documents.\nThese other documents were prepared by unknown third parties, which are presumed\nto be based on alleged statements of the Applicant. These documents were not\npresented to me. In fact, no evidence was presented to me containing any supporting\ndocumentation from the interviews where the Applicant was alleged to have made these\n\nW hile I have no information that Government Exhibits 4 and 7 were improperly prepared, they are the factual\n7\nconclusions of third parties based on second hand information about what the Applicant allegedly told other\npeople, and were not provided to me. As an independent trier of fact, I am not bound by their findings, which\nI have no way of knowing are correct. Accordingly, I have given these exhibits the weight which I believe is\nappropriate.\n9\nstatements. Any fair evaluation of the evidence must take into account the Applicant\u2019s\nabsolute denials, as opposed to the dearth of supporting documentation.7\nApplicant has admitted that on a few occasions he accidentally looked at child\npornography on the internet at least six years ago. He further admitted that he and his\nwife experimented with enhancements to their sex life, which included rape fantasies\nand other bondage and discipline games. He admits to looking at legal pornography.\nApplicant further admits that he was approached by two prostitutes, who may have\nbeen underage, in Asia. \nApplicant further admitted that, on one occasion, a teenage swimmer stood too\nclose to him at a swim meet. He also stated that sometimes his daughter\u2019s friends wore\nprovocative clothes while sleeping over at their house. Finally, he admits showing his\npenis to his two nephews when he was 17 and they were 5 and 6. \nApplicant\u2019s credibility is essential to the decision in this case. The allegations are\nserious, and possibly criminal. He was cross-examined extensively by Department\nCounsel. His testimony was credible and consistent with his written responses, including\nthe ones he made in response to the DL. As discussed above, Applicant freely admitted\nan involvement in legal pornography, and marital sexual conduct, that other people\nwould find difficult to reveal. The credibility finding about the Applicant is supported by\nthe fact that two retired police officers, who are married to each other and have female\nchildren, find the Applicant to be a truthful person.\nI have carefully considered the serious allegations contained in Government\nExhibits 4 and 7, along with the statements the Applicant has made, both in writing and\nduring his testimony. I have looked at all the allegations to see if there is a pattern of\nbehavior towards young girls or women that arises to the deviancy alleged in the SOR.\nThis includes the allegations about the swim team and girls sleeping over. Based on my\nanalysis of the available evidence, I find that he has not engaged in sexual behavior of a\ncriminal nature, that reflects a lack of judgment or discretion, or may subject him to\nundue influence or duress. Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest in any failure to provide\n\n10\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nRegarding all the allegations, the following Disqualifying Conditions are arguably\napplicable:\n16.a. deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n16.c. credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information; and\n16.d. credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information.\nTurning first to the alleged falsifications committed by the Applicant. Once again\nwe are faced with the situation where the alleged false statements of the Applicant are\nwhere he disagrees with factual conclusions in Government Exhibits 4 and 7. Since, as\ndiscussed above, I cannot find with any degree of confidence that the conclusions in the\ndocuments are accurate, the Applicant\u2019s denials cannot be seen as false.\nI have also examined all of the Applicant\u2019s admitted conduct under this Guideline.\nSome people may disagree with his looking at legal pornography, or how he and his\nwife engaged in sexual relations during marriage. They may think that he behaved\ninappropriately with regards to his daughter\u2019s friends, even though there is no allegation\nof improper conduct. However, these facts are not the kind that support the denial of the\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\n\n11\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I specifically find that the\nApplicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under the whole-person\nconcept, independently of Guidelines D and E. \nThe AGA denied the Applicant\u2019s security clearance. They did so making factual\nconclusions, about which I do not have supporting evidence. The nature of his admitted\nconduct was legal or accidental. The admitted conduct occurred at least six years ago\nand has not been repeated. Under the particular facts of this case, I find that there is\nlittle to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and\nthat there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alleged Sexual\nBehavior and Personal Conduct. On balance, I conclude that Applicant has successfully\novercome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.\nAccordingly, the evidence supports granting his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.f.:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 25-year-old man working as a security police officer for a Government contractor (Tr. 66). He graduated from high school in 2001. He has never been married and has no children (Tr. 68). Although he lives with his mother, Applicant testified he has been supporting himself since age 18. He has been continuously employed since high school, except for two short periods of unemployment in between jobs. He was unemployed in 2002 and 2005 on each occasion for an approximately two month period (Tr. 67-68). He has worked for his current employer, a Government contractor, since October 2007 (Tr. 75). He received interim access to classified information when he was hired. Financial Considerations Applicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and included the review of his 2007 e-QIP, his response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 3) and two credit bureau reports (CBRs) from July 2007 (GE 5), and January 2008 (GE 4).

As of the date \nof the hearing, he had 11 delinquent accounts, owing approximately $19,500 which had \nbeen delinquent for many years. His evidence is insufficient to mitigate security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 5, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  GE 1.  \n \nSeptember 17, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                          \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleged security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 13, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 16, 2008. DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on June 23, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled on July \n11, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nadmitted without objection (Tr. 30). Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented \none witnesses and Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 21, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a; 1.b; 1.e; 1.f; 1.j; and 1.k. He \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c; 1.d; and 1.g - 1.1. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old man working as a security police officer for a \nGovernment contractor (Tr. 66). He graduated from high school in 2001. He has never \nbeen married and has no children (Tr. 68). Although he lives with his mother, Applicant \ntestified he has been supporting himself since age 18. He has been continuously \nemployed since high school, except for two short periods of unemployment in between \njobs. He was unemployed in 2002 and 2005 on each occasion for an approximately two \nmonth period (Tr. 67-68). He has worked for his current employer, a Government \ncontractor, since October 2007 (Tr. 75). He received interim access to classified \ninformation when he was hired. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his 2007 e-QIP, his response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 3) and \ntwo credit bureau reports (CBRs) from July 2007 (GE 5), and January 2008 (GE 4). The \nSOR alleges 11 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately $20,000.  \n \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($1,008), 1.b ($900), 1.e ($177), 1.f ($5,943), 1.j, ($508), and 1.k ($172). He explained \nthat he did not recognize the creditors or purchasing anything with the alleged value. In \nSeptember 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator concerning \nall of these delinquent debts. At that time, Applicant indicated he would investigate and \nresolve his debts. During his cross-examination, Applicant\u2019s memory was refreshed with \nrespect to the following SOR allegations: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a - Applicant explained that in 2000-2001, he signed a family plan \ntelephone service contract which included five telephones (Tr. 69-71). He claimed he \nhad problems with the phones and cancelled the service. He never returned the five \ntelephones. Applicant claimed the month before his hearing he contacted the creditor \nand asked for an up-to-date bill, which he did not receive. This was his first contact with \nthe creditor since he cancelled the phone service. Applicant no longer disputes he owes \nthis debt, but only the total of the debt (late fees, penalty charges, and high interest \nrates). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b - Applicant claimed to have no knowledge of this debt, which he \ndiscussed in September 2007 with the Government investigator (Tr. 61). He never \ncontacted the creditor or investigated this debt. He presented no documentary evidence \nto show he disputed the debt (Tr. 80-81).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 Applicant recalled that in 2002, he purchased jewelry for his ex-\ngirlfriend (Tr. 81-85). He claimed he contacted the creditor after his 2007 interview with \nthe Government investigator. He presented no evidence to support his claim. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 Applicant acknowledged this was his credit card account (Tr. 63). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 Applicant admitted this was his son\u2019s medical bill incurred in 2003 \n(Tr. 63, 87). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \u2013 Applicant opened this account when he was 18. He disputes only the \ntotal of the debt (Tr. 63, 88). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g \u2013 This was one of the debts discussed in September 2007 with the \nGovernment investigator. He never contacted the creditor or investigated the debt. He \npresented no documentary evidence to show he disputed the debt (Tr. 92). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h - Applicant admitted this debt in his answer to the SOR. He denied it \nat his hearing and claimed to have no recollection of this debt (Tr. 61). This was one of \nthe debts discussed in September 2007 with the Government investigator. He never \ncontacted the creditor or investigated the debt. He presented no documentary evidence \nto show he disputed the debt (Tr. 95). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i - Applicant admitted he owes $1,000 (Tr. 95). He claimed he disputed \nthe excessive charges with the creditor, and asked for the basis for the additional \n\n \n \n4 \n \ncharges. The creditor never responded and Applicant has chosen to ignore the debt \nuntil the creditor justifies the additional charges. He presented no documentary \nevidence to show he disputed the debt (Tr. 96). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k - Applicant admitted these were his delinquent debts (Tr. 65, \n98-99). \n \nApplicant\u2019s take home pay is around $2,600 a month (Tr. 101-107). His monthly \nexpenses are as follows: $500 rent (to his mother); $200 cable TV; utilities vary based \non what he can contribute (gas and electricity); $590 car payment; $130 car insurance; \nand cell phone $60-$100. When his mother was laid off for two months during late \n2007-early 2008, Applicant had to pay approximately $1,700 rent in addition to other \nhousehold expenses (Tr. 113). He bought a brand new 2007 Ford F-150 in 2007. He \nalso bought a $350 leather helmet to use as a volunteer firefighter. He has been a \nvolunteer firefighter since 2001 (Tr. 39, 126). He was issued a helmet by the fire \ndepartment, but that helmet does not have the same safety rating as the one he \npurchased (Tr. 115).  \n \nApplicant has not participated in any financial counseling. He thought about it, \nbut decided against it because it requires the payment of a fee and he would end up \npaying more (Tr. 111). He has never used a budget to guide his expenditures. He \nclaimed his financial problems were aggravated by his two periods of unemployment, \nand his mother\u2019s two month period of unemployment (Tr. 65). He assisted his mother \nwith her household expenses (day-to-day living expenses, mortgage and utilities) while \nshe was unemployed. He could not afford to take care of his mother\u2019s and his expenses \nand was unable to pay his debts (Tr. 59).  \n \nApplicant explained he acquired most of his debts when he was 18, young, \ncareless, and immature (Tr. 86). He received credit card applications in the mail, and he \ntook the offers and charged up the credit cards. At the time, he did not believe he would \nhave to pay the debts or did not care. He believes he has matured with age and \nexperience. He understands he must pay for his legal obligations, but he cannot afford \nto pay his delinquent debts and take care of his day-to-day living expenses. His plan is \nto pay one-by-one his delinquent debts (Tr. 36-37).  \n \nAround June 2008, Applicant entered into a settlement agreement with the \ncreditor of SOR \u00b6 1.h ($2,596) in which he agreed to make three payments of $500 (Tr. \n36-37, AE 2). As of the hearing day, he had made his first payment (AE 3). He promised \nto resolve all his delinquent debts one at a time, but acknowledged it will take him time. \nApplicant wants to improve his life and credit situation to purchase a home in the future \n(Tr. 36).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                                          \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n4  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n6 \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions \napplicable to these facts which could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case, \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented \nin his credit reports, answer to the SOR and DOHA interrogatories, and his testimony. \nAs of the hearing date, he had 11 outstanding debts totaling approximately $19,500. \nThe government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                                          \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,5 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented little evidence of good-faith efforts \ntaken to contact creditors or to resolve his debts since he acquired them. Although there \nis evidence that in June 2008 he entered into a settlement agreement with one of his \ncreditors, I find that isolated settlement does not establish \u201ca good-faith effort\u201d to repay \ncreditors. Applicant has participated in no financial counseling and there are no \nindications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved or are under control.  \n \nI specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b) \nand conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent. Applicant\u2019s testimony established \nfactors that may be considered as circumstances beyond his control contributing to his \ninability to pay his debts, i.e., his two two-month periods of unemployment; his mother\u2019s \ntwo month period of unemployment and his having to support his mother\u2019s household; \nand the bad decision to purchase a brand new 2007 Ford F-150 and a firefighter\u2019s \nhelmet that were unaffordable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his \nfinancial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR. Applicant has been \nconsistently employed, except for two two-month periods three years apart and three \nyears ago. Since October 2007, he has worked for his current employer. He presented \nlittle evidence to show paid debts, settlements (only one), documented negotiations, \npayment plans, budgets, or financial assistance/counseling. Applicant\u2019s financial history \nand lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that he has established a track record \nof financial responsibility, or that he has taken control of his financial situation. Based on \nthe available evidence, he is overextended financially because of his failure or inability \nto live within his means. His financial problems are recent, not isolated, and are likely to \nbe a concern in the future. \n \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n\n \n \n8 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nApplicant\u2019s seven years working as a volunteer firefighter and his period of work \nfor a Government contractor weigh in his favor. He is considered a valued employee. \nMoreover, as a firefighter, he risked his life to help others in need. Aside from his \ndelinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal issue), he is a good son and takes care \nof his mother. He expressed regrets for his financial mistakes and claimed he is trying to \ncorrect them.  \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in his case, including Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, maturity, his years working as a firefighter and for the Government \ncontractor, he demonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of \nhis financial affairs. He failed to deal responsibly with his financial obligations, especially \nafter receipt of the SOR. His failure or inability to live within his means and to meet his \nfinancial obligations indicates poor self-control or an unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. His behavior raises questions about his reliability, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n \n9 \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g;  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   and 1.-I -1.k: \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 17, 2007, Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On May 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines J and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 21, 2009. He answered the \nSOR on June 8, 2009, and DOHA received his answer on June 10, 2009. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on July 31, 2009. The case was previously assigned \nto two other administrative judges on August 5, 2009 and September 18, 2009, \nrespectively, before it was assigned to me on September 25, 2009. On October 20, \n2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for November 17, 2009. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F, which \nwere received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. Applicant also \ncalled seven witnesses to testify on his behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on November 24, 2009. The record closed on November 24, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions \nare incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old engineer technician, who has worked for his defense \ncontractor employer since July 2007. (GE 1, Tr. 31.) He seeks a security clearance, \nwhich is a requirement for his continued employment. (Tr. 81-82.)  \n \nApplicant was awarded his GED in 1988. He also attended a vocational welding \nprogram while he was in prison, but was paroled before he was awarded his welder\u2019s \ncertificate, discussed infra. He participated in company-related training offered through \nhis previous employer. He enrolled in an online network engineering college program \n\u201cfor about a year\u201d in approximately 2007. (GE 1, Tr. 22, 25-26, 52, 82-83.)  \n \nApplicant married in October 1996 and has two children from his marriage \u2013 a \n12-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. (GE 1, Tr. 23.) Before Applicant\u2019s wife \nbecame a stay-at-home mother, she was employed for ten years as a legal assistant in \nher state attorney general\u2019s office in the child and family protection division. (Tr. 36.) \n \nApplicant has a significant criminal past marked by five arrests. In 1988, he was \nconvicted of driving under the influence (DUI) and public intoxication and was \nsentenced to a $1,200 fine and three years probation. A condition of his probation was \nto abstain from consuming alcohol. He was unable to pay the fine, which he satisfied by \nparticipating in a work furlough program. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) (Tr. 50-63.) \n \nIn December 1989, Applicant was arrested and charged with murder and \naccessory to a felony. Applicant, who had been drinking, was involved in an altercation \nwith the former husband of his then girlfriend. Applicant and several friends brutally beat \nthis individual and someone in the group stabbed him resulting in his death. The \nauthorities were unable to determine who did the actual stabbing. Pursuant to \nApplicant\u2019s guilty plea in March 1990, he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nsentenced to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine.1 He was released from prison in \n1992 after serving two years and two months, and placed on parole for four years. \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant admitted using marijuana and cocaine in 1989. He \nalso admitted to using methamphetamine in 1995 before his last DUI arrest, discussed \ninfra. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) (GE 4, GE 7, GE 10, Tr. 53-63.) \n \nIn 1992, after being released from prison and while on parole, Applicant was \nconvicted of his second DUI. He was sentenced to probation. Applicant testified he took \nthis arrest seriously because he \u201cneeded to clean up [his] act and stop drinking\u201d \nbecause he did not want to go back to prison. He stopped drinking and driving \u201c[a] \ncouple of years\u201d and attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings \u201cmaybe six months to a \nyear.\u201d He began drinking again in 1993. (GE 9, Tr. 64-67.) \n \nIn 1993, Applicant was arrested for vehicle theft and receiving stolen property. \nPursuant to his no contest plea, he was convicted of receiving stolen property and \nsentenced to 365 days in jail and probation. He testified that he subsequently learned \nafter his friend was speeding and involved in an accident that he was driving a stolen \ncar. Applicant served \u201cabout nine months\u201d in jail and was told to \u201ccontinue on [his] \nparole.\u201d He added, \u201cI did get a parole violation for that (receiving stolen property) also \nwhich I received a year of parole violation time which ran concurrent with [his] year in \nthe county jail, so they ran concurrent.\u201d He admitted to being intoxicated at the time he \nwas arrested. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) (GE 5, Tr. 67-70.) \n \nIn 1995, Applicant was arrested for evading a police officer, resisting arrest, DUI, \nand driving on a suspended license. Applicant testified that he had been driving on a \n \n1 The following comments of the sentencing judge are provided: \n \nWell, one thing that this case involves, and it\u2019s obvious from the recitation of the facts in \nthe report, is that this was a brutal attack on a person who certainly was not without fault, \nbut certainly that any fault to which he may have, that did not invite the brutal beating he \ngot and his subsequent death. And certainly [Applicant], was an integral part of the \nvicious assault and the brutal beating because, of course, he was to be the original \ncombatant and when he, as he indicates in his statement, determined that others started \ngetting involved, he didn\u2019t back off, as he should have. He struck the victim five or six \ntimes while the victim was down, and the victim really wasn\u2019t down until everybody got \ninvolved. And that certainly is inexcusable.  \n \nAnd the most significant aspect of this entire matter is not as far as aggravating \ncircumstances because I cannot under the law aggravate for the corpus of the crime, but \n[victim\u2019s] dead. And [Applicant] who contributed to his death is here. And certainly the \nfacts indicate the scenario to which the plea was made, in other words, the crime to \nwhich the plea was made and I have no quarrel with that, but, [Applicant], if you had \nlearned some lessons from court proceedings previously, and if you had obeyed the \nterms of probation, which were imposed by the courts previously, specifically not to use \nalcohol, then it\u2019s unlikely you have been partying at this place in the first place and you \nwould not have been drinking and your good senses wouldn\u2019t have been impaired and \nvery likely and hopefully you wouldn\u2019t have done or helped instigate this. So you are a \nperson very responsible for the death of [victim]. There\u2019s no two ways about it. (GE 10 \n(pgs. 145-146)). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nsuspended license since 1992. Also at the time of this DUI arrest, he had used \nmethamphetamine, discussed supra. Applicant was still on parole at the time he was \narrested for DUI. Also, at the time of this arrest, the police found marijuana and a \nhandgun in the car. Applicant testified that the handgun belonged to his friend and the \nmarijuana belonged to him. Pursuant to his plea, he was convicted of evading a police \nofficer and DUI. He was sentenced to 365 days in jail and four years probation. He \ncompleted his four-year probation sentence in 2000. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) (GE 6 (p. 59), Tr. 70-\n76.) \n \nAfter serving his jail sentence, Applicant moved to another state to change his \nenvironment. He initially found a job landscaping and later found a job with a cardboard \nmanufacturer where he worked from July 1996 to March 2007, approximately 11 years. \nDuring his tenure with this employer, he started as a bail room operator, received \nseveral promotions, and was a corrugator supervisor at the time he was fired for \nunsatisfactory performance. Applicant explained the reason he was fired, \u201cwas a \nconversation me and my superintendent had one day where we had a sort of conflict of \ninterest where I was in charge of [the corrugator] department and this machine and \nproducing --\u201d Applicant\u2019s superintendent informed him his department was not \nproducing enough to which Applicant replied that \u201cwe need to get some things fixed in \norder to produce more.\u201d Applicant\u2019s stated his company failed to provide the necessary \nequipment needed to produce more. He challenged his termination unsuccessfully. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a.) (GE 1, Tr. 24-31.) \n \n \nAfter moving to a new state in 1996, Applicant\u2019s children were born, he began \nattending church, he and his wife had their marriage blessed in their church, he bought \na home, and has focused on \u201cbeing a positive role model for [his] children.\u201d Since he \nwas released from jail in 1996, he was only stopped once for speeding. He testified that \nhe drinks responsibly and has not used any drugs since 1995. (Tr. 76-80). \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s testimony, he called seven witnesses to testify on his \nbehalf \u2013 a deputy sheriff and seven-year neighbor, an attorney in private practice and \nformer assistant attorney general and ten-year friend, two work-related supervisors, his \nwife, and two minor children. The witnesses established that Applicant has made a \nsignificant turnaround in life since his most recent release from jail in 1996. They further \nestablished that Applicant is a responsible and productive member of the community, an \nexcellent worker, and a model husband and father. Applicant\u2019s two minor children \nreferred to him in very supportive terms and their affection for him was very sincere. (Tr. \n85-144.) \n \nApplicant submitted five exhibits \u2013 two work-related awards; a work-related \nscreening clearing him for arms, ammunition, and explosives; a letter from Applicant, \nand two work-related reference letters. (AE A \u2013 AE E.) The latter three exhibits were \npreviously submitted in his Response to SOR. The collective sense of these documents \nreflects that Applicant is well regarded by his employer.  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying (DCs). The DC asserted by the Government was, \u201c(a) a single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d (Tr. 149-150.)  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MCs). \nApplicant\u2019s turnaround following his fifth arrest and third incarceration and recent history \nof gainful employment create some mitigation under two of them. These are: \u201c(a) so \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and, \u201c(d) there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  \n \nFor mitigation analysis, Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed criminal conduct and his criminal \nhistory must be evaluated as a whole, not piece by piece. His criminal past was not an \nisolated incident event nor did it consist of a few minor skirmishes with the law. It \nspanned a seven-year period with the most serious offense occurring in 1989 with his \nconviction for involuntary manslaughter. As the trial judge noted before sentencing \nApplicant to prison, had he obeyed the terms of his 1988 probation not to drink alcohol, \nhis senses would not have been impaired and he would not \u201cvery likely and hopefully\u201d \nbeen involved with an incident that resulted in the senseless death of another individual. \nAfter being released from prison for this offense, he had three subsequent arrests, two \nof which involved alcohol. His last four arrests involved a parole or probation violation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s recent good employment record, job training, and period of \nabstinence from criminal activity are evidence that support successful rehabilitation. \nGiven the serious and repetitive nature of his former criminal activity, I cannot conclude \nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and judgment. In conclusion, I cannot with confidence state that I have \n\u201cno doubt\u201d about granting Applicant access to classified information given his track \nrecord. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 15, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 sets out seven personal conduct-related conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns and may be disqualifying in this case. One of those conditions is \npotentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources. \n \nThe Government established, through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence \npresented, that he was terminated from his employment in March 2007 for \nunsatisfactory performance. The foregoing warrants application of AG \u00b6 16(d). \n \nPotential mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17 are: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant worked for his previous employer approximately 11 years before being \nterminated in March 2007. His 11-year tenure with this employer was marked by several \npromotions. Shortly after being terminated, he began working for his current employer in \nJuly 2007. His current employment record is superb, and the behavior is not repetitive. \nHe was unemployed for a relatively short period of time between jobs. The facts taken \nas a whole warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e). \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern involves five arrests \nspanning a seven-year period and three periods of incarceration. The most serious \narrest resulted in his conviction for involuntary manslaughter for the needless and \nsenseless death of his former girlfriend\u2019s ex-husband.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s motivation and actions to become a good parent and provider are \ncommendable. His disassociation from criminal activity and gainful employment are all \nsignificant and noteworthy steps toward establishing rehabilitation and responsibility. \nApplicant\u2019s turnaround is noteworthy and for that he should be commended.  \n \nHowever, on balance, the record evidence generates substantial doubts \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He has \nnot met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d2 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 20-year-old employee of a defense for whom she has worked since August, 2007. Her work involves testing equipment. The three alcohol related incidents upon which this matter is based occurred in a six-month period between August 2006 and February 2007. The last incident was six months before her present employment began. The three incidents and the actions taken on each are as follows: The first incident (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) occurred in August 2006 when Applicant was 18 years old and she was arrested while holding an open beer can in a parking lot of an Indian casino where a rodeo was being held. She was arrested for under-age consumption of alcohol, fined $250 (Exh. 5), and jailed briefly until a friend\u2019s mother obtained her released. She was also banned from the casino grounds until she reached age 21 which is their policy about minors. The second incident (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) occurred in November 2006, when she was arrested by county police for driving over the speed limit on an interstate highway, \u201cminor possession of alcoholic beverage\u201d, and \u201cpossession of an open alcoholic container in the car\u201d (Exhs. 3 and 4). She had one passenger in the car who was also cited. The car was impounded but Applicant was not prosecuted (Tr. 32, 33).

Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nOn August 2, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance. On August 20, 2008,\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, (Directive). The revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006,\nare applicable.  \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nMarch 27, 2009\n\n2\nor continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement on September\n24, 2008. She admitted all five of the factual allegations relating to alcohol consumption,\nand denied the one allegation under personal conduct relating to falsification of material\nfacts to an official investigator. She requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 30, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on February 2, 2009, for a hearing on February 18, 2009. It was held that day.\nAt the hearing, the government offered eight exhibits (Exhs. 1-8) that were admitted in\nevidence without objection. Applicant submitted no exhibits but testified on her own\nbehalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 25, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 20-year-old employee of a defense for whom she has worked since\nAugust, 2007. Her work involves testing equipment. The three alcohol related incidents\nupon which this matter is based occurred in a six-month period between August 2006\nand February 2007. The last incident was six months before her present employment\nbegan. The three incidents and the actions taken on each are as follows:\nThe first incident (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) occurred in August 2006 when Applicant was 18\nyears old and she was arrested while holding an open beer can in a parking lot of an\nIndian casino where a rodeo was being held. She was arrested for under-age\nconsumption of alcohol, fined $250 (Exh. 5), and jailed briefly until a friend\u2019s mother\nobtained her released. She was also banned from the casino grounds until she reached\nage 21 which is their policy about minors. \nThe second incident (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) occurred in November 2006, when she was\narrested by county police for driving over the speed limit on an interstate highway,\n\u201cminor possession of alcoholic beverage\u201d, and \u201cpossession of an open alcoholic\ncontainer in the car\u201d (Exhs. 3 and 4). She had one passenger in the car who was also\ncited. The car was impounded but Applicant was not prosecuted (Tr. 32, 33). The\ninvestigative report for this incident (Exh.3) also led to the allegation of giving false\ninformation to an OPM investigator (SOR \u00b6 2.a.)\nThe third incident (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) occurred in February 2007 after Applicant went\nwith friends to watch her mother compete in a benefit rodeo event for hospice. The\ngroup went to a friend\u2019s house for 1-2 hours of drinking. They returned to the rodeo for a\nconcert and then went back to the friend\u2019s house and drank more alcoholic beverages.\nWhen she left the party she drove and was arrested and charged with four different DUI\noffenses (Exhs. 7). Three were dismissed and she plead guilty to the fourth charge of\nhaving a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .08 or more. She was ordered to spend 24\nhours in jail and was fined $1800 to be paid in $50 per month installments for 36\nmonths. They started in April 2007, at sentencing so she is still paying the fine. She was\n\n3\nalso ordered to receive Level II alcohol treatment and education classes for three\nmonths in 2007 which she completed successfully (SOR \u00b6 1.e.). \nApplicant has a history of youthful drinking. She first drank a wine cooler at age\n14. At age 16, she snuck out of the house to drink but was usually caught and punished\nby her mother (Tr. 47). Since the last incident in 2007, she has had a drink once or\ntwice at a birthday party, but soon decided she should not drink at all and has not done\nso. The above incidents occurred soon after high school graduation when she rebelled\nat parental authority and left home to live with her boyfriend for a year. She has since\nresolved parental problems and has been living with her parents for the past two years.\nShe is enrolled in college, studying chemical engineering, and has completed three\nsemesters of studies (Tr. 16). \nApplicant is highly regarded by her employer for her attitude, work ethic, and\nexceptional contribution to the work of her office (Exhs. A, Items 1 and 2). In addition to\nher employment, she frequently works as a baby-sitter for neighbors. She also rides her\nhorse and is ambitious to become a rodeo contestant. She no longer has contact with\nthe friends she was with when the three incidents occurred (Tr. 49). She no longer sees\nher former boyfriend. Her activities outside work now are family related (Tr. 62-66). She\nregrets her conduct during the first year after high school. One of her moments when\nshe recognized the need to change her ways was seeing some of the children she baby\nsits and thinking her conduct could have endangered them (Tr. 50). She no longer\nchafes at parental guidance and restrictions, and recognizes that living at home and\nfollowing rules isn\u2019t a bad thing (Tr. 62). \nThe arresting officer for the second incident reported several facts in his report\nthat Applicant disputes. One was that she admitted that she was drinking while driving\nand that she had exceeded 100 miles per hour. She denied this information in her\nstatement to the government investigator in this matter. She contended that she was not\ndrinking while driving but that only her passenger was drinking and there was alcohol in\nthe car (Exh.2). In her answer to the SOR, she also denied the allegation that she was\ndrinking while driving. These were the only facts in the government exhibits disputed by\nApplicant, and they related to the only one of the three arrests or charges that did not\nresult in prosecution. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n4\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d\ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant]\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3.\n        Analysis\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude that the following Adjudicative Guidelines provide the standard for\nresolution of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n\n5\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption in\nthat, \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The relevant ones to this matter are:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\n            The evidence submitted clearly raises these potentially disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides three conditions that could mitigate security concerns based on\nthe facts of this case:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and,\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress.\n        Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption began at an early age and continued until she\nfound that it interfered with her ambitions and her employment. The offenses she\ncommitted were serious and involved others with whom she was driving. However, they\noccurred during a period in her life when she, like many others of her age, commit\nyouthful indiscretions that they come to regret. While she should have learned from the\nfirst incident and certainly the second, she did have the problem driven home to her\nforcefully after the third incident. She has had over two years of conduct free of\nincidents since that time. She acknowledges her past problems and has taken steps to\ninsure that such will not occur in the future. She has had counseling sessions and from\n\n6\nher conduct since that time, she has changed her lifestyle. I find that Mitigating\nConditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 23 a, b, and c are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\n         The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:  \n Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout and an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information (AG \u00b6 15).\n     Conditions that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying include\ndeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an\ninvestigator or other official government representative (AG \u00b6 16(b)). Applicant\u2019s\nstatements to an investigator prompted security concerns under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).\n          The guideline requires that the statements be deliberately false or misleading. I\nconclude that they were not. Applicant admitted the relevant facts surrounding the other\ntwo alcohol related incidents that resulted in prosecution and punishment. This one was\nnot prosecuted, and it is difficult to see any motivation to falsely dispute the facts at this\npoint when there is nothing to gain from by doing so. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Applicant is young but\nhas found her niche and is applying herself in college and in her work. She has promise,\na good job and ambition to succeed and avoid the mistakes she made two years ago.\n\n7\nShe has family support and is intelligent enough to recognize the need she still has for\nthat family structure. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concerns of the government. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting\nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and\ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or\novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for\naccess to classified information.\n     Formal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For  Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: For  Applicant\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is granted.\nCharles D. Ablard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a public trust position is denied.\nOn January 19, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust\nPositions (SF 85P) to request eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position  involving access to\n1\nsensitive information as part of her employment with a defense contractor. After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\n2\nApplicant\u2019s request. On June 19, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nOctober 30, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n I excluded Gx. 4 and Gx. 5 because they did not meet the authentication requirements of Directive Enclosure\n4\n3, \u00b6 E3.1.20. (Tr. 22 - 33)\n2\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E\n3\n(personal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on August 6, 2008, and I convened a hearing on September 3, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 -\n5).  Applicant testified in her own behalf, offered two exhibits admitted without objection\n4\nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A and B, and presented one witness. DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on September 18, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged she owed approximately $19,003 for\n19 delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.s. Applicant admitted without explanation all\nof the Guideline F allegations. Under Guideline E, the government alleged that, by\nanswering \u201cno\u201d to question 22 (debts greater than 180 days past due)of the SF 85P she\nsubmitted, Applicant had deliberately made a false statement to the government.\nApplicant admitted she had answered \u201cno\u201d but denied any intent to falsify her answer or\nto mislead the government about her finances. In addition to the facts admitted through\nher response to the SOR, I make the following findings of fact based on my review of\nthe pleadings, transcript, and exhibits. \nApplicant is 23 years old and employed by a health care and medical insurance\ncompany contracted to manage medical insurance claims and information for\nTRICARE, the Department of Defense (DoD) medical insurance system for military\npersonnel and their families. She has held her current position since January 2007, and\nhas performed well in all her assigned duties. Friends, family, and co-workers hold\nApplicant in high regard for her trustworthiness, hard work and reliability. (Gx. 1; Ax. A;\nAx. B; Tr. 74 - 77) Appellant is currently attending school to study surgical technology as\npart of her plan to become a nurse. (Tr. 6 - 7)\nApplicant graduated from high school in June 2003. Thereafter, she attended\ntechnical and vocational schools through at least January 2007. She financed her tuition\nthrough student loans and she has always lived at home with her mother and step-\nfather. She has accrued numerous other delinquent or past due debts. The background\ninvestigation included a check of her credit (Gx. 3), which revealed she owed at least\n$10,273 for 11 delinquent accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.l). The same credit report also\nshowed she had five student loans totaling approximately $7,308, which were in deferral\nas of February 2007 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o - 1.s). She admitted in response to the SOR that, as\n\n Applicant has paid off her car. (Tr. 64)\n5\n3\nof January 2008, those loans were delinquent. In response to DOHA interrogatories\n(Gx. 2), Appellant also conformed she owed the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n.\nAside from occasional minimal payments of $10 or $20 depending on available\ncash, Applicant has not paid or otherwise resolved any of the debts listed in the SOR.\nShe earns about $1,200 in take home pay each month. Aside from expenses related to\nher car,  miscellaneous purchases and occasional dining out, and payments on a line of\n5\ncredit (World Finance) and a personal loan (Sunset Finance) (Tr. 67 - 69), Applicant has\nno major expenses. Gx. 3 contains multiple account entries for both Sunset and World\nFinance. This suggests that Applicant uses these creditors as a source of funds to pay\nother debts on a recurring basis. Additionally, her mother and step-father have struggled\nfinancially due to employment problems and, most recently, her step-father\u2019s poor\nhealth. Applicant contributes between $300 and $500 each month (sometimes much\nmore) to help her parents with mortgage, utilities, and other necessities. Applicant\nestimates she has about $40 0r $50 remaining after expenses each month. (Tr. 61 - 67)\nThe debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.c arose when Applicant\u2019s brother wrecked her car.\nBecause Applicant did not carry enough insurance to fix the car, it was a total loss and\nApplicant stopped paying on the note. However, the creditor forgave the debt, resulting\nin a taxable benefit to Applicant reflected in an IRS Form 1099 for the 2007 tax year.\nThere is no indication she did not pay her taxes for 2007. (Tr. 45 - 46)\nApplicant contacted a credit counseling and debt consolidation company in\nSeptember 2007. She made one payment on a debt repayment plan, but left the\nprogram in October 2007 when her step-father became ill. (Gx. 2) She also made\ninquiries about financial counseling through her employer but never actually enrolled in\nany program. (Tr. 52, 69 - 71)\nOn January 19, 2007, Applicant signed and submitted her SF 85P. In response\nto question 22.b, which asked if she was, at that time, more than 180 days past due on\nany loan or other financial obligation, she answered \u201cno.\u201d Applicant denied intentionally\nfalsifying her answer to mislead the government about her finances, claiming she had\nnever looked at her credit report before she submitted the SF 85P. However, she\nadmitted in her testimony that she was aware at the time she completed the form that\nshe had several past due debts. (Tr. 49 - 50, 58 - 59) She further claimed that she\ncontacted her company\u2019s human resources department after she saw her credit report\nand asked if she could make changes to the form. She was told it was too late to do so.\n(Gx. 2; Tr. 50)\nPolicies\nEach trustworthiness decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n6\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to sensitive\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations), at AG \u00b6 18, and Guideline E (personal conduct),\nat AG \u00b6 15.\nA trustworthiness determination is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to automated sensitive information. The government bears the initial\nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to\ndeny or revoke a position of trust for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be\nable to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden,\nit then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. \nA person who has access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.8\n\n5\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct.\nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct may be a concern because, as stated in AG \u00b6 15, is\nthat \n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe government\u2019s information shows Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to questions about\nher finances. Gx. 1 reflects she answered the questions as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a;\nhowever, to be disqualifying, it must be shown Applicant knowingly intended it as a false\nanswer so as to mislead the government by concealing her financial problems. Because\nApplicant denied this allegation, the government bore the burden of \u201cpresenting\nwitnesses and other evidence to establish facts that have been controverted.\u201d\n(Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.14) In this case, there is sufficient evidence\nshowing Applicant has had debts that have been unresolved for well more than 180\ndays. It is also clear from her testimony that she was aware of her delinquent debts\nwhen she completed the SF 85P, even if she did not have a complete and detailed\nrecord of her debts that could be found in a credit report. \nApplicants are required to provide truthful answers at all times during the\ninvestigative and adjudicative process. Withholding relevant information about one\u2019s\nbackground can potentially impede the government\u2019s ability to make an accurate\ndecision about granting access to sensitive information. To satisfy her obligation to be\ntruthful, Applicant could have simply answered \u201cyes\u201d without providing any factual detail.\nYet her failure to do so and the information available information bearing on this issue\nsupport application of the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities).\nApplicant claimed she wanted to correct her answers after she saw her credit\nreport, but was told it was too late. Her claim requires consideration of the mitigating\ncondition at AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts). Her\nstatement in this regard is credible. Applicant\u2019s testimony was straightforward, and her\ndemeanor was sincere. It does not appear that Applicant was interviewed by a\ngovernment agent during her background investigation, so there was no confrontation\nuntil DOHA adjudicators sent her interrogatories. While she knew about her debts and\ndeliberately answered \u201cno\u201d to question 22, her subsequent intent to correct must be\nconsidered and that she is entitled to some benefit from AG \u00b6 17(a). In light of all of the\navailable information about the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, I conclude the security concerns\nabout Applicant\u2019s personal conduct are mitigated. \n\n6\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nNotwithstanding the exclusion of Gx. 4 and Gx. 5, the government presented\nsufficient information to support the allegations in the SOR. However, SOR \u00b6 1.l\nappears to be a duplicate of the debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.j. Further, the debt listed at SOR\n\u00b6 1.c is no longer a debt. Accordingly, I find for the Applicant as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.l.\nOtherwise, available information shows she still owes at least $14,600 in past due\ndebts. As to her student loans, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o - 1.s total $7,308), available information\nshows that they are no longer in deferral and are now past due. Available information\nalso shows that Applicant does not have the means to satisfy her debts. She helps\nsupport her parents, leaving  her with less than $100 to spare each month. Accordingly,\navailable information requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant has been unable to show\nshe has acted to resolve her debts, that her financial problems are past and will not\nrecur, or that she is getting any financial help and/or counseling to help improve her\nfinances. In short, there is no information before me that supports application of any of\nthe mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 20. Applicant has failed to overcome the adverse\ninformation about her finances on which DOHA adjudicators relied when they issued the\nSOR. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and F. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 23 years\nold. She is a reliable worker for her company and a devoted daughter to her parents.\nWhile she is sincere in her desire to resolve her financial problems, she is simply unable\nto do so. There is no information about her finances that suggests her circumstances\nwill change in the near term. It is laudable that she is helping her parents through\ndifficult times, but the fact remains that her personal circumstances undermine the\ngovernment\u2019s confidence about her suitability for a sensitive position. In short, the\nfavorable information in her background is insufficient to overcome the security\nconcerns about her already (at age 23) lengthy history of bad debt. The facts and\ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s finances present an unacceptable risk were she to be\ngranted access to sensitive information. \n\n See footnote 6, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n7\nA fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on\n9\nApplicant\u2019s finances shows there are still doubts about her ability or willingness to\nprotect the government\u2019s interests as her own. Because protection of the national\ninterest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved for the\ngovernment.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d - 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m - 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a position of trust.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Applicant is a 51-year-old senior technology architect employed with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a position of public trust. He has been employed with the defense contractor since May 2005. He is married and has an 18- year-old son and a sixteen-year-old stepson. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering and has taken some graduate level courses. He has held some form of a security clearance or position of public trust since 1982. (Tr at 5-7, 15-16, 93; Gov 1) From January 1981 to February 2005, Applicant was employed with another defense contractor. His last position with the contractor was senior staff engineer. His employer issued him a laptop computer for him to use in order to fulfill his duties. He was authorized to take the laptop with him when he traveled for the company. Applicant traveled quite often. (Tr at 15-16, 93) Applicant\u2019s previous employer had rules which prohibited the use of company computers to visit pornographic and/or adult websites. The rules also prohibited the use of the company computer to view pornographic pictures and/or download pornographic videos. Applicant admits that he was aware of the above company rules. He signed a statement acknowledging that he was aware of the rules pertaining to the proper use of the computer. (Tr at 16-17) The Manager of the company\u2019s",

On August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline \nM, Use of Information Technology Systems, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 15, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nNovember 17, 2008. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nNovember 17, 2008. The case was transferred to me on December 12, 2008. On \nFebruary 6, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for February \n23, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government called two witnesses \nand offered three exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 3, \nwithout objection.

DOHA received the transcript \nof hearing on March 3, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to position of public trust is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but \ndenies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b.  \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old senior technology architect employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor seeking a position of public trust.  He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since May 2005. He is married and has an 18-\nyear-old son and a sixteen-year-old stepson. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in \naeronautical and astronautical engineering and has taken some graduate level courses. \nHe has held some form of a security clearance or position of public trust since 1982. (Tr \nat 5-7, 15-16, 93; Gov 1) \n \nFrom January 1981 to February 2005, Applicant was employed with another \ndefense contractor.  His last position with the contractor was senior staff engineer. His \nemployer issued him a laptop computer for him to use in order to fulfill his duties. He \nwas authorized to take the laptop with him when he traveled for the company. Applicant \ntraveled quite often. (Tr at 15-16, 93)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s previous employer had rules which prohibited the use of company \ncomputers to visit pornographic and/or adult websites. The rules also prohibited the use \nof the company computer to view pornographic pictures and/or download pornographic \nvideos.  Applicant admits that he was aware of the above company rules. He signed a \nstatement acknowledging that he was aware of the rules pertaining to the proper use of \nthe computer. (Tr at 16-17) The Manager of the company\u2019s Security Operations and \nInvestigations Department, stated the rules prohibiting the use of company computers to \naccess pornography was widely known by all of the company\u2019s employees. (Tr at 44)  \n \nFrom August 2004 to July 2005, Applicant was assigned to work at one of the \ncompany\u2019s other offices which was located in another state. He would work at that \nlocation on Monday through Friday but flew home on the weekends. One morning in \nlate December or early January 2005, Applicant visited an adult web-site using his \ncompany laptop computer. He downloaded several videos. He agrees that the videos \nand the web-site were probably X-rated but states they contained no images of sexual \nintercourse.  He admits that he was aware that he was violating company policy when \nhe accessed the adult web-site. He claims that he only viewed the adult web-site using \nthe company laptop computer on that one occasion. After he visited the web-site, \nnumerous pop-ups came up for other adult web-sites. (Tr at 18 \u2013 23)   \n \nIn late December or early January 2005, Applicant\u2019s laptop computer broke \ndown. He contacted the company information technology department and gave them his \ncompany laptop in order for them to repair it.  While repairing the laptop, a technician \ndiscovered pornographic files on Applicant\u2019s laptop. This information was forwarded to \n\nFOR OFFICAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this information contains information  \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n3\nSecurity Operations and Investigations Office on January 7, 2005. (Tr at 23, 43-44: Gov \n2; Gov 3) \n \nOn January 10, 2005, Applicant was called into the Security Operations and \nInvestigations office. He was interviewed by the manager of the department about the \npornography that was found on his company laptop. He initially denied that he accessed \nthe adult web-site using his company laptop. He initially blamed it on his teenage son \nand his friends. Approximately five to ten minutes into the interview, the investigator \nasked him how his son was able to access the adult web-site since a password and \nlogin was required to access the lap top. Applicant then admitted to accessing the adult \nweb-sites on his lap top but claims that he was using his own separate network. He \nbelieved that he had erased the images from the system. (Tr at 24 -29, 49-50)   \n \nOn February 7, 2005, Applicant was terminated from the company for violation \nand misuse of information technology.  The manager of security operations and \ninvestigations testified. He conducted the internal investigation and interviewed \nApplicant. He personally examined the images on Applicant\u2019s company computer and \nconcluded they were pornographic. The computer images were saved and an internal \ninvestigation was conducted. He observed approximately 10 to 15 short videos and \nsome still photographs.  He observed approximately 1,500 pornographic images on the \ncomputer that could not be downloaded.  He believes that these pornographic images \nwere viewed and downloaded over a seven-month period on more than one occasion. \nThere were 16 videos and eight pornographic web-sites in the files on Applicant\u2019s \ncomputer. (Tr at 43-48)  \n \nWhen the manager questioned Applicant he does not recall whether he asked \nApplicant how many times he may have visited pornographic web-sites. He does not \nrecall Applicant indicating how many times he had accessed pornographic web-sites \nusing the company laptop. (Tr at 50) During the internal company investigation, still \npictures and video clips were saved to a DVD. About 1,500 images that were not \ndownloaded on Applicant\u2019s laptop were deleted. Applicant\u2019s company laptop was then \npurged of all pornographic images. The laptop was returned to Applicant after the \npornographic images were purged. (Tr at 50 -52)  The DVD was not presented as part \nof the government\u2019s case.       \n \nAfter Applicant was terminated, he worked as an independent contractor for his \ncurrent employer. In April 2005, he was hired as a full-time employee. On March 6, \n2006, he submitted a Public Trust Position Application, SF 85P. In response to question \n\u201c7. Your Employment Record,\u201d he listed that he was fired from his previous employer on \nFebruary 7, 2005 for \u201cViolation of company policy regarding personal use of company-\nprovided computer while on TDY.\u201d (Gov 1) \n \nApplicant met with an investigator conducting his trustworthiness background \ninvestigation on several occasions. (Applicant recalls meeting with the investigator on \nthree occasions. The investigator recalls meeting with Applicant on two occasions. The \nnumber of occasions is not relevant to the facts of this case.) The investigator first met \nwith Applicant on October 24, 2007, to discuss Applicant\u2019s termination from his previous \n\nFOR OFFICAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this information contains information  \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n4\nemployer for misusing the computer. He authenticated the summary of the unsworn \ndeclaration which he prepared the same day of the interview which is Government \nExhibit 3.  He does not recall the specific questions asked during the interview.  The \ninvestigator does not recall discussing the issue pertaining to Applicant initially denying \nthat he was responsible for the pornographic material on the company laptop. (Tr at 63)    \n    \nIn May 2008, the investigator was contacted and asked to have Applicant \nprepare a written affidavit.  He met with Applicant on May 15, 2008, in the parking lot of \na fast food chain.  Applicant had limited time because he had a conference call that \nmorning. The investigator prepared the affidavit himself with the summary of Applicant\u2019s \ninitial interview which is Government Exhibit 3.  He wrote the affidavit in the first person.  \nWhen he met with Applicant, he had Applicant review the affidavit and allowed him the \nopportunity to make any changes. He had Applicant initial and sign the affidavit.  The \ninvestigator did not ask Applicant any questions during this meeting.  He did not swear  \nApplicant to an oath when he signed the affidavit. (Tr at 61-63, 111-114)  \n \nApplicant disputes that he accessed pornography using his company computer \nnumerous times over a seven month period. He claims he visited an adult web-site only \nonce. He claims that when the security office returned the company laptop to him, the \npornographic web-sites remained on the computer.  He offered AE A and AE B which  \nallegedly contain the links, addresses, and/or the pornographic web-sites that were \ncontained on his company laptop.  Both documents are given less weight because \nApplicant had the opportunity to show these documents to the manager of the Security \nOperations and Investigations Office to verify that these were the documents they \nretrieved from his computer during his testimony.  He offered these documents after the \nwitness had left since neither side wished to hold him subject to recall after testifying. \nApplicant said that if there was only one thing that he would take back was that he \nwished he would have told the truth from the beginning. (Tr at 94 \u2013 107)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor testified that he has known Applicant since 2004. \nThey worked on a contract proposal together when Applicant was employed with his \nprevious company. In 2005, Applicant started work as an independent consultant for the \ncompany. He was eventually hired as a full-time employee. The witness supervised \nApplicant since that time. He still has daily contact with Applicant. He states Applicant\u2019s \nperformance reviews state that he meets or exceeds expectations. Applicant\u2019s work is \nexemplary. He is very detail oriented and has a strong work ethic. Applicant is \nconscientious about time-keeping and billing the proper hours. He has no difficulty \nfollowing corporate security policies. Applicant passed a reliability check with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Since working for the company, Applicant has not \nhad any violations pertaining to the misuse of computers. The supervisor states \nApplicant is very trustworthy and recommends him for a security clearance. (It is noted \nthat Applicant is applying for a position of public trust.) (Tr at 74-83) \n \nA co-worker of Applicant testified that he has known him for over 25 years.  \nApplicant is currently his program manager but they worked together at a prior defense \ncontractor. Their current interaction at work is between every few days to once a week. \nThey occasionally socialize outside of work such as going to lunch or dinner. They \n\nFOR OFFICAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this information contains information  \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n5\nplayed golf a couple times.  He describes Applicant as one of the most honest and \u201cby \nthe rules\u201d people he knows. Applicant follows company policies. He recommends \nApplicant for a security clearance. The co-worker has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer \nscience. He testified cookies or files can be stored on a computer through a third party \nwithout the owner of the computer\u2019s knowledge. (Tr at 83 \u2013 90)  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as Asensitive positions.@  \n(See Regulation && C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  AThe standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person=s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.@ (See \nRegulation & C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation & C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant=s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge=s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG & \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe Awhole person concept.@ The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \nFOR OFFICAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this information contains information  \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n6\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n      \nAnalysis \n \nUSE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information \nTechnology Systems is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under Guideline M (M DC) apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \n \n \nM DC \u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem) \n \n \nM DC \u00b6 40(f) (introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, \nsoftware, or media to or from any information technology system without authorization, \nwhen prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations) \n \n \nApplicant \ndemonstrated \nextremely \npoor \njudgment \nwhen \nhe \naccessed \npornographic web-sites using his company laptop. He admits to being aware of the \ncompany rules prohibiting the use of company computers to access pornographic web-\nsites when he accessed the pornographic web-sites suing his company laptop.  He had \nno special authorization for accessing pornographic web-sites using the company \ncomputer. Nor did he have permission to download pornographic files on his company \n\n \nFOR OFFICAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this information contains information  \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n7\nlaptop. While there is a dispute as to the extent of pornographic files that Applicant \nviewed and over what period of time, there is no factual dispute that Applicant violated \ncompany policy by accessing pornographic web-sites using his company laptop.  As a \nresult, he was terminated after working 24 years for the company.  \n \n \nThe concerns under Guideline M can be mitigated. I find that Guideline M \nMitigating Condition (M MC) \u00b6 41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) applies to Applicant\u2019s case.  Although Applicant exercised extremely poor \njudgment when he accessed the pornography using his company laptop, more than four \nyears has passed since his termination in February 2005.   He has been employed full-\ntime with another defense contractor. He has not been involved in similar incidents at \nhis new employer. His current supervisor thinks highly of him and recommends him for \na trustworthiness position. His poor judgment in his previous job resulted in the loss of a  \n24-year career. He clearly learned a lesson.  Considering the price Applicant paid for his \nextreme lapse of judgment, and that more than four years have passed with no similar \nconduct his current workplace, the concerns raised under Guideline M have been \nmitigated.   \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThere are specific disqualifying conditions which may be raised. With respect to \nSOR \u00b6 2.a which alleges that Applicant denied knowledge of pornographic material on \nhis company laptop when he was interviewed during the internal company investigation \nin January 2005, the following Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) \napply to the facts of this case: \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, \nor other official government representative) \n \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \n\n \nFOR OFFICAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this information contains information  \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n8\ncommunity standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging, in any activity that is \nillegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and \nmay serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group)  \n \n \nApplicant admits that he initially lied to the security manager who interviewed him \nregarding the discovery of pornography on his company laptop. He deliberately \nprovided misleading information by claiming that his son and his son\u2019s friends used his \ncompany laptop to access his computer. He did so out of concern as to the \nconsequences if he admitted to it. \n  \n \nThe personal conduct concern can be mitigated. With respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a, I find \nthe following personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC) apply: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17 (d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress)  \n \n \nApplicant misled the investigator for approximately ten minutes prior to \nacknowledging that he actually accessed pornographic web-sites using his company \nlaptop. While his initial denial demonstrated poor judgment, he made the decision to be \ntruthful during the same interview and misled the investigator for only a brief period of \ntime. He acknowledged his behavior. Since that time, he provided full disclosure for the \nbasis for his termination when he submitted his public trust application in March 2006.  \nHe has had a successful career for over four years with his current employer, always \nmeeting or exceeding the standards expected of him.  No similar incidents have \noccurred since his termination in February 2005.  Applicant mitigated the personal \nconduct concerns raised under SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant provided a misleading statement in his written \nstatement provided on May 15, 2008, by not indicating that he first denied that the \npornographic material was his when confronted by the security representative about the \npornographic content on his government laptop. I find for Applicant with regard to this \nallegation.  The investigator who interviewed Applicant and prepared the statement in \nquestion does not recall whether the issue about Applicant\u2019s initial denials ever came up \nduring the first interview in October 24, 2007, and on May 15, 2008. The affidavit was \n\n \nFOR OFFICAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this information contains information  \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n9\nprepared by the investigator for Applicant to sign based on the investigator\u2019s summary \nof October 24, 2007 interview. The investigator did not interview Applicant on May 15, \n2008. He met Applicant on that date for Applicant to review and sign the affidavit. He did \nnot ask Applicant to provide him step-by-step details as to what occurred when he was \ninterviewed by the company security investigator during the internal investigation related \nto the pornography found on Applicant\u2019s company laptop. I cannot conclude that \nApplicant provided misleading information in his May 15, 2008 statement. Given the \ngeneral questions that were asked, it does not appear Applicant deliberately omitted the \nfact that he initially denied that he was responsible for the pornography found on his \ncompany laptop when he was first confronted. SOR \u00b6 2.b is found for Applicant.  \n \n \nApplicant mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline E. The personal conduct \nconcern is found for Applicant.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance and/or trustworthiness position by \nconsidering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The \nAdministrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and \nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the \nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of \nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance and/or trustworthiness position must \nbe an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s 24-year \nhistory with his previous employer. I considered that he was a mature adult who was \naware of company rules pertaining to accessing pornography using his company laptop. \nI considered that he initially denied responsibility when he was interviewed by company \nsecurity personnel regarding the pornography found on his computer. Applicant \ndemonstrated extremely poor judgment which ultimately led to his termination from a \ncompany he worked at for over 24 years. However, since then he has successfully \nworked for another company for over four years with no repeats of similar incidents. He \nis a valued employee at his current job. Given the severity of the consequences \nresulting from Applicant\u2019s poor judgment, it is unlikely that he will repeat similar conduct \nin the future. Applicant learned a very difficult lesson. He mitigated the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline M and Guideline E and demonstrated that he is worthy \nto be granted a position of public trust.  \n\n \nFOR OFFICAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this information contains information  \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n10\n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1 Guideline M:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2 Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n Subparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n  \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a trustworthiness \nposition.  Eligibility for a position of public trust is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn February 1, 2007, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On July 9 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nH (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 6, 2008, and requested his \ncase be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nOn January 28, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written \ncase.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the \n \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant. He was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on February 3, 2009.  \nApplicant filed a response to the FORM on March 1, 2009, within the 30 day time \nallowed that would have expired on March 3, 2009. \n \nI received the case assignment on March 16, 2009.  Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 9, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in all the subparagraphs of the SOR. He also provided additional information \nto support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old, widowed in April 2006 from his second wife, and has \nno children.  He was divorced from his first wife.  He has worked for defense contractors \nfor the past 27 years.  He has a degree in electrical engineering, and is about to finish a \nmaster\u2019s degree in software engineering. (Items 3-6) \n \n \nApplicant had a security clearance from October 1972 until July 1976 and from \nOctober 1980 until November 1990. The Government again granted Applicant a security \nclearance from April 1995 until the present. (Item 4, Question 26) \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on a regular basis from September 1976 until early \nNovember 1989, and purchased it from 1976 to 1988.  Applicant received an \nunfavorable determination in August 1990 by a Directorate for Industrial Security \nClearance Review (DISCR) Administrative Judge in a non-hearing case at the \nApplicant\u2019s request, which decision was affirmed by the DISCR Appeal Board in \nNovember 1990, on this drug involvement issue.  The Administrative Judge in 1990 also \nfound Applicant experimented with amphetamines, and occasionally purchased and \nused hashish.  Applicant\u2019s answer of July 9, 2008 to the SOR admitted the marijuana \nuse and purchases in the 1980s, selling marijuana, cultivating marijuana plants, using \namphetamines until August 1981, and purchasing and using hashish until June 1980, \nthough no starting dates were given. (Items 3 and 6) \n \n \nApplicant admitted using marijuana several times a week from February 2006 \nuntil May 2007.  He admits using the marijuana to cope with his second wife\u2019s cancer, \nand her death in April 2006.  Applicant admitted using marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance in 1999.  He also admitted using marijuana after submitting his SF-86 \nin February 2007 while holding a security clearance. (Items 3 and 4) \n \n  \nApplicant was also found in the 1990 decision to have falsified his security \nclearance application by failing to disclose his marijuana and other drug use during the \n1976 to 1980 time period, and his drug use while holding a secret security clearance.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHe admitted this allegation again in his Answer of July 2008.  Applicant\u2019s answer claims \nhe passed two drug tests in 1990 and two tests in 1993, with negative results. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant answered his February 2007 SF-86 in \u201cSection 24: Your Use of Illegal \nDrugs and Drug Activity\u201d by admitting his illegal drug use in the past seven years, \ndenying ever using illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, and denying illegally \npurchasing or receiving any narcotic, cannabis, or other illegal drug.  In fact, Applicant \nused marijuana while holding his most recent security clearance, and he received \nmarijuana between February 2006 and May 2007 from his brother-in-law.  Applicant \nmade an unsworn declaration in his interview on May 23, 2007 with a Government \ninvestigator that the marijuana \u201cmade him feel relaxed, hungry, tired and sleepy.\u201d  \nApplicant also told the investigator that he never used \u201cany other illegal drugs.\u201d  He also \nclaimed he never \u201cbought, sold, or cultivated marijuana\u201d which was contrary to the \nfindings of fact in the 1990 DISCR decision that he cultivated and sold marijuana up to \ntwo years before the decision, and his use of other drugs did occur, though some years \nearlier.  Applicant told the investigator in 2007 that he did not intend to use marijuana in \nthe future because it was illegal. The 1990 decision cites Applicant\u2019s statement in May \n1990 that he had resolved not to use marijuana in the future. (Items 4-6) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to illegal drugs: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and \nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \nhallucinogens), and \n \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and, \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \n \nApplicant admits to using marijuana as recently as May 2007. AG \u00b6 25 (a) \napplies.  He has illegally possessed marijuana at various times since 1976, even after \nreceiving an unfavorable security clearance decision in 1990. AG \u00b6 25 (c) applies.  \nApplicant used marijuana while holding security clearances before 1990, as determined \nin the 1990 DISCR decision, and during his current security clearance from 1995 to the \npresent. AG \u00b6 25 (g) applies. Applicant declared in 1990 and again in 2007 that he \nwould not use marijuana in the future. His repeated use after his earlier declaration \nmakes his current statement unbelievable. He failed to \u201cclearly and convincingly commit \nto discontinue drug use\u201d based on his repeated conduct and assertions that marijuana \nhelps him relax and cope with stress.  AG \u00b6 25 (h) applies.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n  \n  \nReviewing each of these mitigating conditions, it is clear that none apply.  \nApplicant\u2019s recent use and extensive history of past use cast doubt on his current \nreliability, and particularly his trustworthiness and good judgment.  After having an \nadverse decision made against him in 1990, and being a mature adult with a college \ndegree, he disregarded the law and continued to use marijuana for his personal \npleasure.  He has not demonstrated over the past 18 years that he will not abuse drugs \nin the future.  Particularly serious is Applicant\u2019s repeated use of marijuana while holding \na security clearance. The record evidence does not support the application of the the \nlast two mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 26 (c) and (d),  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 15, the following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance \naction or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n \n \n \nApplicant was found in 1990 to have falsified his security clearance application \nby not disclosing his marijuana and other illegal drug use.  He failed again to disclose \non his most recent security clearance application his use of marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance.  AG \u00b6 16 (a) applies.  His repeated use of marijuana over many \nyears makes him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress because his \nactivities might affect his personal, professional, or community standing.  AG \u00b6 16 (e) \napplies.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n  \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s situation.  He has not \nmade prompt and good-faith efforts to correct the omissions on his security clearance \napplication, the SF-86.  There is no evidence he got bad advice from a lawyer or other \nauthorized person to make his answers lack full disclosure. The repeated use of \nmarijuana by an adult professional while holding a security clearance is not a minor \noffense.  Nor has Applicant obtained counseling for his long-term marijuana use.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a mature 55-year old \nprofessional electrical engineer.  He has a history of smoking marijuana since 1976.  He \nused amphetamines and hashish in the 1980s.  He purchased marijuana for his own \nuse before 1990, and then again in 1999 and 2006 to 2007. He has not changed his \nbehavior, nor acknowledged the wrongfulness of his conduct.  He regards marijuana as \nrelaxing and sleep-inducing.  There is no rehabilitation shown, and it is likely his \nmarijuana use will recur.  Applicant has shown a consistent lack of judgment and refusal \nto seek professional help with his multi-year history of illegal drug use. \n \nFurthermore, on two security clearance applications he falsified his answers by \nfailing to deliberately disclose his continued use of marijuana while holding a security \nclearance both times.  Applicant is not credible in anything he stated in his Answer \n\n \n10 \n \n \nabout marijuana and his usage in the future. Because of his mendacious answers on \ntwo Government security clearance applications as he sought security clearances in the \n1990 and 2007, he is not to be believed on any of his assertions. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against \nApplicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-\nQIP), on October 16, 2006. On July 2, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nOn August 3, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2008. The \ncase was delayed because Applicant was working in Iraq and did not return to the \nUnited States until late January 2009. On February 6, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was \nissued, scheduling the hearing for March 4, 2009. The case was heard on that date. \nThe Government offered seven exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits \n(Gov) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant testified and offered seven exhibits which were admitted as \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A - G. His wife served as his personal representative. The \nrecord was held open until March 18, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments. An additional 17-page document was timely submitted and admitted as AE \nH. The transcript was received on March 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case \nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and admits the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e.  \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old logistics management specialist employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance.  He has worked for his \ncompany since September 2004. His highest level of education is a high school \ndiploma. Applicant enlisted in the United States Army in September 1988. He injured his \nback and separated from active duty in 1991. He was on the temporary disability retired \nlist. In 1994, he was declared fit for duty and returned to active duty. He served until \n1997. He separated on March 10, 1997 as a specialist (E-4) with an Honorable \ndischarge. He is married and has no children. His wife has two adult children. (Tr at 6-\n11, 38-39, 61-63; Gov 1; AE H at 9, 11)  \n \nOn October 16, 2006, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP), in order to apply for a security clearance. (Gov 1) A \nsubsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had several delinquent \naccounts, an approximate total balance of $66,454.  The delinquent accounts include:  a \n$5,914 credit card account charged off in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 5 at 2; \nGov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 3); a $7,000 credit card that was charged off in July 2003 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b: Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 8); a $1,434 credit card account that was charged off in July \n2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 6); a $3,970 account placed for collection in \nJanuary 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $6,249 credit card placed for \ncollection in January 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 9, 10); a \n$15,818 credit card account that was placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: \nGov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 3, 10);  a $15,045 balance owed after a voluntary car \nrepossession that was charged off in March 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 2; \nGov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 3; AE B at 2; AE C at 3); and an $11,024 credit card account that \nwas placed for collection in June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 7 at 6). \n \nOn May 23, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator conducting his \nbackground investigation. He indicated that he purchased a home in 1998 but was not \nprepared for the additional financial burdens that came with owning a home. He did not \nhave money to furnish the house and pay his monthly bills. He and his wife charged \nmany bills and household expenses to their credit card accounts. The credit card bills \npiled up until he was unable to pay the credit card bills and meet his household \nexpenses.  Applicant wants to pay his debts but has no income at the end of the month \n\n \n3 \n \n \nto pay his expenses. When his financial situation improves he intends to pay these bills. \n(Gov 3 at 3.) \n \nIn response to interrogatories, dated March 10, 2008, Applicant indicated that he \nwas deployed to Iraq and his financial situation was improving rapidly.  He indicated that \nhe was saving all that he can in order to pay back all of his debt. He hoped to pay off all \nof his debt in 2009 when he returns from Iraq.  He indicated that some of the debts \nshould drop off his credit report due to the age of the debt but indicated that he was \naware that it was his obligation to pay the debts back. He would not compromise his \ncharacter or perform his job unethically because of his debts.  He has served in the \nmilitary or worked for a defense contractor since 1988. He would hate to think that he \ncould lose all that he has accomplished. That is why he wants to do the right thing and \npay off his debts. (Gov 2 at 4-5) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant indicated that some of the accounts are double or triple the \noriginal balances due to late fees. He referred to the debts as \u201cjunk debt.\u201d He testified \nthat his initial financial problems began in November 2003. His wife lost her job in 2001 \nbecause of health issues and has not worked since. They had three roommates who \npaid rent which helped with the mortgage payments. They all left at once. He states that \nthe fact that these are old debts should mitigate some of the concerns raised. Some of \nhis delinquent accounts will be deleted from his credit report in less than a year. He \nbelieves that settling these old debts may not be in his best interest because they may \nreappear as entries on his credit report which could adversely affect his credit rating. He \nis aware that the government needs to trust him but doesn\u2019t want to be put in a position \nwhere he has bad debts listed on his credit report for additional years.  He has no \nmotivation to do anything stupid or violate the law. (Tr at 26-29) \n  \nApplicant provided proof that he has resolved two accounts. They were not \nalleged in the SOR but were considered during his background investigation. (Tr at 23-\n24; AE D; AE E) The status of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR are: \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d and 1.h: $5,914 charged off credit card account. This account \nwas settled on April 8, 2008, for $1,506. Applicant states that the SOR allegations are \nthe same debt.  The record evidence indicates that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d are the same \ndebt. (Tr at 43-44, 50-51; AE A; AE F) There is substantial record evidence to conclude \nthat SOR \u00b6 1.h is also the same account. I come to this conclusion because the same \naccount number is listed on the credit report entries for the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.h. (Tr at 50- 53; Gov 7 at 3, 6; AE G)  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d and 1.h are found for Applicant.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: $7,000 credit card account. Applicant claims this account is the same \nas the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f.  The record evidence supports this premise. It appears \nthe creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f purchased the debt from the original creditor who is \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.b because it is a \nduplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.f. (Tr at 48-50, 56-57; Gov 7 at 3, 8, 10) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $1,484 credit card account. No payments have been made on this \naccount. (Tr at 55-56) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $6,249 credit card account placed for collection. The debt remains \nunresolved. (Tr at 56) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: $15,818 collection account.  This is the same account as SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nThis creditor is the collection agency collecting on the original debt. The balance \nincreased substantially due to late fees and penalties. This debt has not been resolved. \n(Tr at 50, 56-57) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: $15,045 amount owed after a voluntary car repossession.  In 2002, \nApplicant purchased a car with no money down and no payments for 12 months. At the \nend of the 12-month period, he was unable to make the car payments and initiated a \nvoluntary car repossession. He has not contacted the creditor to make payment \narrangements. The debt remains unresolved. (Tr at 57-58; Gov 3 at 3)  \n \nApplicant worked two tours in Iraq as a contractor. His first tour was from January \n2005 to late December 2005. His second tour was from January 11, 2008, to late \nJanuary 2009. Applicant\u2019s salary in Iraq was double his stateside salary. (Tr at 60-61) \nHe used the extra income to put as much as he could into his 401(k) account; he made \nextra mortgage payments; and made payments towards the bills that were in good \nstanding. (Tr at 65) \n \nStateside, Applicant earns approximately $60,000 annually. His gross monthly \nincome is $5,000. His net monthly income is $2,400. He also receives a VA disability \ncheck each month for $263. Applicant took out two loans against his 401(k) account. \nThe monthly payments are automatically deducted from his pay. This explains why his \npaycheck is significantly lower than his gross monthly income. In 2004, he took a loan of \n$17,000. This will be paid in 2010. He took out a second loan against his 401(k) in late \n2006. He borrowed $22,000 in order to purchase a new car. He bought a new car for \n$32,000 in 2007. The value of his 401(k) is currently $69,000. The balance used to be \n$160,000 before the problems with the stock market began. (Tr at 32-35, 43)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly expenses include mortgage $1,200; car loan $171; car \ninsurance $150; gas $120; electric $332; cell phone $99; cable $100; Internet $45; \nwater $35; groceries $250; clothes $25. Applicant has one open credit card with a \n$1,200 balance. He makes a $100 monthly payment. In 2004, Applicant purchased a \ntime share for $15,000. He pays $300 per month for the time share. His total monthly \nexpenses are $2,877. His net monthly income is currently $2,663. He has approximately \n$13,000 in his savings account. (Tr at 31-42)   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant enrolled with a credit counseling company. He used their \nservices for awhile but stopped because he was unable to afford the $700 monthly \npayments. From 2002-2003, he enrolled with another credit counseling company but \nstopped for similar reasons. (Tr at 46-47) \n \nApplicant received numerous awards, certificates of achievement, and letters of \nappreciation throughout his civilian and military careers. (AE H)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n6 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Since 2002, Applicant accumulated a \nsignificant amount of delinquent debt. At the close of the record, approximately $38,546 \nin delinquent accounts remain unresolved. Late fees and penalties for lack of payment \nhave contributed to the total balance of the debt. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. While \nseveral of the accounts were duplicates, Applicant continues to have significant \nunresolved debt. Applicant has paid several of his delinquent accounts. However, his \nplan for most of the delinquent accounts is to wait for them to drop off his credit report \nrather than attempting to resolve the accounts. He does not deny that they are his debts \nbut believes that any attempts to resolve the older accounts would adversely affect his \ncredit rating. During the same time that he incurred delinquent accounts, he purchased \na timeshare, contributed the maximum amount to his 401(k) account, and purchased a \nnew car for no money down and no payments for 12 months. After 12 months, Applicant \nturned the car in because he was unable to make payments. With some better judgment \nand planning, Applicant could have managed his finances and established a plan to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nresolve his delinquent accounts. Questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, trustworthiness, \nand reliability remain based on Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligations.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s wife lost her \njob in 2001 and had surgery. She has not worked since that time even though she is \ncapable of working. Applicant states that his financial obligations were aggravated when \nthree individuals who were renting rooms from he and his wife unexpectedly moved out. \nThis may have some impact but Applicant could have sought out additional boarders to \nhelp out with the mortgage payment.  Applicant was paid double his salary in 2005 and \n2008 while working in Iraq. Instead of developing a plan to resolve his delinquent \naccounts, Applicant allotted more money to his 401(k) account, made additional \nmortgage payments, and additional payments towards his current accounts. He did not \nact responsibly under the circumstances.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. While Applicant consulted credit counselors in the past, he has \nnot done so recently. Although he resolved several of his delinquent accounts, several \ndelinquent accounts remain with no plan in place to resolve the accounts.   \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. However, the remaining debts remain unresolved. Applicant implied at hearing that \nhe intends to wait until the older accounts are removed from his credit report rather than \nattempt to settle the accounts.  When he worked in Iraq, he had significant extra money \nto apply towards his delinquent accounts. He chose to apply the extra income towards \nother things as opposed to resolving his delinquent accounts. He has not demonstrated \na good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d and 1.h; and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.f. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. 1.d, and 1.h because the \nrecord evidence established that they are duplicate accounts and Applicant submitted \nproof that the debt was resolved. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.b because \nit is a duplicate account with SOR \u00b6 1.f. I do not find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 \n1.f because it is not resolved.   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s active duty \nmilitary service and his years of employment with a Department of Defense contractors. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s explanations for his delinquent debt. I considered that Applicant \nhas resolved several accounts and several accounts were duplicates. However, a \nsignificant amount of delinquent accounts remain with no established plan to settle \nthese accounts. It is unlikely the delinquent accounts will be resolved in the near future \nbecause Applicant\u2019s current monthly expenses are more than his monthly income. He \nhas not met his burden to mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: James Green, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was convicted of Statutory Rape in 1983, and admitted engaging in an\nextensive pattern of deviant sexual activities over a period of several decades. He failed\nto prove his claims that his misconduct was sufficiently known to family, friends, and\ncoworkers to alleviate his susceptibility to coercion or duress. Based upon a thorough\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.  \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on August 24, 2006. On\nMay 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines D (Sexual\nBehavior), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\nJanuary 22, 2010\n\n2\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 19, 2009. He answered (AR)\nthe SOR in writing on June 1, 2009, and requested that his case be decided by an\nadministrative judge on the written record without a hearing. On August 28, 2009,\nDepartment Counsel indicated his readiness to proceed and requested a hearing before\nan administrative judge in accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7. Applicant was notified of\nthis election by letter dated August 31, 2009, and DOHA assigned the case to me on\nSeptember 22, 2009. Neither Applicant nor his counsel raised any objection to\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request for a hearing on timeliness or other grounds.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 1, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on October 27, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf, as did three other witnesses, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A\nthrough D. These exhibits were admitted subject to Department Counsel\u2019s reservation\nof the right to further evaluate and possibly rebut AE D, which he first received right\nbefore the hearing. I granted both counsel\u2019s request to leave the record open until\nNovember 3, 2009, for submission of additional evidence. On that date, Applicant\nsubmitted additional evidence, with a copy to Department Counsel and requested that it\nbe considered. Department Counsel expressed no objection to their admissibility, and\nsubmitted no other evidence. Applicant\u2019s new exhibits were marked AE E through K,\nand admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 4, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 56-year-old engineer who has worked for a federal contractor for\nalmost four years. In his answer to the SOR, he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n2.a, 3.a, and 3.b, with explanations. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and\n1.d, including 1.d(1) through 1.d(10), with explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are\nincorporated into the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is married for the second time. He has two adult daughters, one by\neach of his wives, and an adult stepson. He enlisted in the Army from 1971 to 1976,\nwhen he was medically discharged. He has never held a security clearance except a\ntemporary interim clearance with his current employer. (GE 1 at 6, 10, 14-20, 25-26, 32;\nTr. at 114-116, 120.)\nApplicant pled guilty to, and was convicted of, Statutory Rape, 2  Degree, in\nnd\nDecember 1983. This offense involved his sexual molestation between January 1982\nand August 1983 of his stepson, who was then 11 to 13 years old. He was sentenced to\nten years confinement, which was suspended subject to his successful participation in\nand completion of the Sexual Psychopathy program at a state psychiatric hospital. As\npart of his plea bargain, a second charge of Indecent Liberties involving other sexual\n\n3\ncontact with the stepson, also a felony, was dropped. Applicant was also sentenced to\nten years of probation, restitution and costs. (AR; GE 2.) \nAfter his August 1983 arrest, but before his December conviction, Applicant\nattended a group outpatient sexual psychological treatment program. Applicant claims\nthat he \u201cwholeheartedly participated in the treatment program, and followed all rules,\nprocedures, and treatment plans.\u201d (AR at 3.) He found the program insufficient to meet\nhis needs, however, and sought additional treatment elsewhere. He \u201cfreely shared with\nthe group [his] concerns and the fact that he was seeking other treatment. This was\nlooked on unfavorably by the group and directly led to [his] being voted out of that\ngroup.\u201d (Id.) His subsequent assessment at the state hospital states that his course at\nthe outpatient treatment program \u201cindicates that there was only superficial compliance\nwith the program, poor compliance with conditions, and perhaps a great deal of\nrationalization by seeking the easiest way out, namely \u2018obtaining Christian counselling\u2019.\u201d\n(GE 4 at 2-3.) The outpatient program director described Applicant as \u201cvery antagonistic\nand quite unhelpful to the other men in the group\u201d and \u201ca chronic, out-of-control\npedophile with both male and female victims.\u201d The director recommended inpatient\ntreatment because Applicant \u201cwished to control treatment, diagnose himself, and [was]\nresistant to counseling.\u201d (GE 4 at 24.) After being dismissed from this outpatient\nprogram in October 1983, Applicant received treatment from a Ph.D. managerial\npsychologist for several months. (GE 4 at 13; AE D; Tr. at 126-127.) \nApplicant participated in the inpatient sex offender treatment program at the state\npsychiatric hospital from July 1984 until late October or early November 1985, when he\nannounced that he no longer desired to participate in the program after completing three\nof the ten required steps. Among other things he admitted during treatment were\nmultiple molestation incidents involving both his elder daughter and stepson from 1976\nto 1983, and early stage grooming behavior toward his younger daughter who was only\nseven years old at the time of his arrest. (GE 4 at 6, 25.) In late November 1985, he was\nreturned to the custody of the county sheriff. The hospital reported to the court that\nApplicant \u201cwas no longer amenable to treatment in the Sex Offender Program . . . and\nthat, as a sexual psychopath who was considered untreatable, he was not safe to be at\nlarge. The prognosis is very poor.\u201d (GE 4 at 25-26.) His final diagnosis was \u201cParaphilia,\npedophilia, predominantly homosexual. Alcoholism, in remission due to confinement.\nHistory of street drug abuse. Antisocial personality disorder with passive-aggressive\ntraits.\u201d (Id.)\nAs part of his sexual psychotherapy treatment, Applicant wrote a sexual\nautobiography. In it, and during subsequent therapy sessions, he admitted to a pattern\nof deviant sexual activities beginning at approximately age 6, and continuing to the time\nof his arrest in August 1983, at age 30. As set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d(1) through 1.d(10),\nthese included heterosexual and homosexual acts with children and adults, many of\nwhom were relatives including his children, a nephew, and his brother-in-law. They also\ninvolved engaging his first wife in group sex, acts of bestiality, using pornography for\narousal, and using alcohol and illegal drugs as disinhibitors towards physical and sexual\nurges. (GE 4; AR; Tr. at 128-129.)\n\n4\nAfter release from the state psychiatric hospital, in November 1985, Applicant\nwas confined in the county jail pending probation revocation proceedings. The court\nheld a series of hearings concerning Applicant\u2019s amenability to further treatment and\nwork-release. On June 23, 1986, the judge ordered his release into active, intensive,\nsupervised probation, and an outpatient sex offender counseling program by an\napproved psychologist. No evidence was provided by either party concerning this\ncourse of treatment or its outcome, but on May 23, 1988, the court granted Applicant\u2019s\npetition and ordered termination of his suspended sentence, his discharge from\nprobation, and restoration of his civil rights. (GE 2 at 29-46.) There is no evidence of\nany subsequent sexual misconduct, although he and his wife remain aware of and\ndiscuss potential concerns and he avoids close or unsupervised contact with any\nchildren except his grandchildren. (AR at 6; Tr. at 85-86.)\nFrom June 1986 to November 2003, Applicant worked in the maintenance\ndepartment of an aviation services company, and ultimately became the director of\nmaintenance. He left that job under unfavorable circumstances after a dispute with the\nowner over unsafe practices in connection with recording and scheduling maintenance\nrequirements about which he ultimately wrote a letter to the Federal Aviation\nAdministration. (GE 1 at 12, 28; Tr. at 118-119, 147-150.) He was then self-employed\nperforming aircraft maintenance services until his present employer hired him in June\n2006. (GE 1 at 11; Tr. at 119-120.)\nApplicant submitted letters from his stepson and younger daughter saying that\nthey had forgiven him, have reconciled, and presently have a good and loving\nrelationship. They claim in general terms to know all about their father\u2019s past, but have\nnot told their children about it in detail. Instead, they taught their children to avoid and\nreport any improper touching by anyone. Applicant has a close and loving relationship\nwith his seven grandchildren, who are ages 10 to 18. (AE E; AE G; AE H; AE K; Tr. at\n85-86.)\nApplicant submitted testimony and letters from longtime friends, professional\nacquaintances, coworkers, and supervisors expressing their opinions of his high\nintegrity, trustworthiness, responsibility, good judgment, and reliability. Many of these\npeople claimed to know, in general terms, about Applicant\u2019s past \u201cmistakes\u201d and his\nconviction for Statutory Rape in 1983. (AE A; AE B; AE C; AE F; AE I; AE J; Tr. at 36-\n73.) None of these people demonstrated any specific or detailed knowledge about the\nquantity and range of sexually deviant behavior to which Applicant admitted during his\nsex offender treatment programs, and Applicant took the position that he disclosed his\npast to the degree he thought someone needed to know. (GE 6 at 3; Tr. at 103-109,\n138-141, 174-177.) \nOn September 10, 1992, Applicant confronted his stepson over stealing\nApplicant\u2019s property to sell or pawn for funds to support the stepson\u2019s cocaine use.\nApplicant physically assaulted the stepson, after which he admitted the thefts. Applicant\nwas subsequently arrested and charged with Assault in the Fourth Degree. After a\ncontested bench trial, he was found guilty on November 10, 1992. After a series of\n\n5\ncontinuances, his sentencing was deferred for 12 months on April 7, 1993, on condition\nthat he have no further violations, pay a $50 fee, and complete an anger management\nprogram. On March 22, 1996, the court found that Applicant had substantially complied\nwith his deferred sentencing conditions, and dismissed the charge. (GE 3; GE 6 at 2;\nAR at 5; Tr. at 88-90.)\nIn preparation for his hearing, Applicant and his wife visited the managerial\npsychologist from whom he received several months of treatment between his post-\narrest outpatient program and his sentencing to inpatient therapy. This psychologist had\nneither records nor recollection of his earlier course of treatment, but provided a\npsychological evaluation based on two interviews with Applicant and one with his wife.\nHe found \u201cmany elements of a strong and healthy psyche,\u201d and stated that it was\n\u201cdifficult to find many weaknesses in [Applicant\u2019s] psychological profile.\u201d The\npsychologist further stated that Applicant does not believe he is susceptible to blackmail\nor leverage because he had \u201cdisclosed his full past\u201d to his employer, and his family and\nmost of his friends are \u201cfully aware of all issues.\u201d He concluded \u201c[Applicant\u2019s]\npsychological/mental health is excellent. There are no psychological factors that should\nprevent [Applicant] from being granted full security clearance.\u201d The psychologist\u2019s\ndescription of the \u201cissues\u201d from Applicant\u2019s \u201cfull past\u201d consisted of \u201cillegal sexual\nbehavior,\u201d \u201cchild sexual abuse,\u201d and \u201cpleading guilty to statutory rape.\u201d There is no\nindication this psychologist was aware or informed of the extent of sexually-deviant\nbehavior to which Applicant admitted during his other treatment programs. (AE D; Tr. at\n109-111.)  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider and apply the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n6\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded in mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides, \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under this guideline:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DCs):\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n\n7\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MCs):\n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no\nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\nApplicant\u2019s conviction of Statutory Rape and admission of additional child\nmolestation offenses for which he was never prosecuted establish security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 13(a). The record further shows a pattern of compulsive and high risk\nsexual behavior for almost 25 years. This behavior was diagnosed, during two sex-\noffender psychiatric treatment programs that he failed to complete, to be symptomatic of\nhis paraphelia, pedophilia, and antisocial personality disorder. This supports potential\ndisqualification under AG \u00b6 13(b). The degree and extent of sexual deviancy that\nApplicant committed, combined with the high regard in which he is now held by friends,\ncoworkers, and grandchildren, who were not shown to be remotely aware of that\nconduct, establishes an ongoing vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress under\nAG \u00b6 13(c). Finally, as Applicant admitted, his sexual conduct reflected lack of judgment\nunder AG \u00b6 13(d). The burden thus shifts to Applicant to extenuate or mitigate these\nsecurity concerns flowing from his admitted behavior under all four DCs.\nAlthough a substantial number of the deviant sexual acts admitted by Applicant\ntook place prior to or during his adolescence, the substantial evidence of subsequent\nconduct of a similar (or worse) nature, including a felony conviction, precludes mitigation\nunder AG \u00b6 14(a). Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior of concern all took place more than 25\nyears ago, but was frequent and not under unusual circumstances. Its likelihood to recur\nis reduced by his lengthy abstention from such behavior, but he and his wife remain\nconcerned enough about his possible temptation to re-offend that they discuss it\nregularly and try to avoid situations in which that might occur. This is commendable, but\nalso reflects their own rational doubts concerning his current reliability, trustworthiness,\nand judgment, and precludes more than minimal mitigation under AG 14(b). \n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s conviction for Statutory Rape was shown to be sufficiently well known\nthat, in itself, might support mitigation under AG \u00b6 14(c). However, the nature and extent\nof the behavior underlying that conviction, as well as all the other deviancy detailed in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d(1) through 1.d(10), were not shown to be known to the many friends,\ncoworkers, and grandchildren whose high regard he worked hard to establish and now\nrightfully values a great deal. Accordingly, his sexual behavior continues to serve as a\npotent basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress, and AG \u00b6 14(c) was not established.\nMuch of Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior of security concern was private, in that it was not\nknown to others. That would alleviate concerns under AG \u00b6 13(d) for public sexual acts,\nbut his conduct did not reflect good judgment or discretion, and its private nature forms\nthe basis for ongoing coercion concerns under AG \u00b6 13(c). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes the DCs under this guideline. The specific Guideline E\nconcerns raised by the SOR allegations include:\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing . . .;  \nand the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness issues the Appeal Board has found to\nbe inherent under AG \u00b6 15. ISCR Case No. 06-20964 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008).\nThe nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s crimes against his children, and his other\nsexually deviant conduct, together with his concealment of his true culpability from\nothers whose knowledge of it would adversely affect his personal, professional, and\ncommunity standing, create ongoing vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and\nduress. These acts also raise serious concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides personal conduct MCs. The only MCs with potential\napplicability to the foregoing security concerns are:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\n\n9\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nAG \u00b6 17(c) was not established for the reasons discussed above concerning AG\n\u00b6 14(b). Applicant produced evidence to support the first prong of AG \u00b6 17(d), and is\ntaking commendable steps to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. This provides some\nmitigation of the judgment and trustworthiness concerns, but not of the concerns over\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. The steps Applicant has taken to reduce\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress are insufficient, because the nature\nand extent of his sexual conduct understandably have not been revealed to those\nwhose good opinion he values and has worked hard to establish. AG \u00b6 17(e) was not\nshown to be applicable.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes Criminal Conduct DCs, two of which are\nraised by the evidence: \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and \u201c(c)\nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant was arrested and convicted of Statutory Rape, 2  Degree, a felony, in\nnd\n1983. He was also convicted of assaulting his stepson in 1992. These facts sufficiently\nraise security concerns under the DCs set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth potential criminal conduct MCs. These are: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n\n10\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicability of the MC set forth in AG \u00b6 32(a) is minimal for the reasons\ndiscussed above concerning AG \u00b6 14(b). There is no evidence Applicant was pressured\nto commit these offenses by anything other than deviant sexual urges about which he\nand his wife remain concerned, so AG \u00b6 32(b) was not established. AG \u00b6 32(c) was not\nasserted, but Applicant provided sufficient evidence of rehabilitation through the\npassage of more than 17 years since the assault and 26 years since the sex offenses,\nhis evident remorse, job training, and a good employment record to support mitigation of\ncriminal conduct security concerns under AG \u00b6 32(d). Accordingly, Paragraph 3 is found\nfor the Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of\nsecurity concern involves a period of almost 25 years during which he engaged in\nnumerous deviant sexual acts including felonious child molestation for which he was\nultimately convicted in 1983. He eventually completed court-ordered sex offender\ntreatment, after failing to complete his first two programs, and was discharged from\nprobation in 1988. He was also convicted of assault in 1992, but that charge was later\ndismissed after he completed probation and an anger management program. His\nparticipation in these events was voluntary and motivated by self-gratification or anger.\n\n11\nThere is no evidence of any sexual misconduct since 1983, or criminal conduct\nsince 1992, and Applicant has reestablished a good reputation and affectionate\nrelationships within his family and among his friends. This is positive evidence of\nrehabilitation. He is highly regarded by professional acquaintances, coworkers and\nsupervisors as well. Many of these people know he was convicted of statutory rape\nmore than 25 years ago, and his children and wife know what he did to them. However,\nduring treatment he also confessed to a number of additional acts of deviant sexual\nbehavior as specified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d(1) through 1.d(10). Information about these actions\nwould be likely to severely damage the esteem in which he is currently held by these\npeople who have become important in his life. Despite his general assertions during the\nsecurity clearance process, and to the managerial psychologist whose opinion he\noffered in evidence, that he had fully disclosed his past misconduct, no credible\nevidence was presented to show that these people knew the specifics of his deviant\nacts. The two close friends who testified knew very little, in fact. The potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress arising from this potentially humiliating\ninformation continues to date and, if anything, grows in its ability to threaten his\nincreasing reputation as an honorable man. \nThe likelihood of recurrence of deviant sexual conduct has been reduced by the\nongoing efforts of Applicant and his wife to prevent that. However, the potential for\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress from exposure of the [avoid the temptation to\neditorialize] details of his past sexual conduct is certain to continue. Applicant presented\ninsufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns arising from his sexual behavior and\npersonal conduct. The record generates significant doubt as to his present eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 31, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 19, 2008. Applicant filed a\nresponse to the FORM on November 4, 2008. The case was assigned to me on\nDecember 8, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant was born in Italy in 1959. She moved to the United States with her\nparents in 1960. In 1972, she became a naturalized United States citizen.\nOn a trip to Italy in 1981, she became engaged to an Italian citizen. They married\nin 1984. From1981 to the present, applicant has lived in Italy.\nApplicant has worked for an international organization to which the United States\nbelongs for over twenty years.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are United States citizens. They have resided in Italy since\n1981. Applicant\u2019s three siblings are dual citizens of the United States and Italy and\nreside in Italy. At least two of her siblings have lived in Italy since 1981.\nApplicant\u2019s three children are dual citizens of the United States and Italy and\nreside in Italy.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and siblings-in-law are citizens and residents of Italy.\nApplicant and her husband own their home in Italy. In addition, they own two\napartments and vacant land in Italy.\nApplicant has voted in Italian elections since 1984.\nApplicant currently works as an assistant to a high ranking United States official.\nThe official submitted a letter on applicant\u2019s behalf. In it, the official states that the\nofficial has had daily contact with applicant since November 2007, the official \u201csimply\ncannot overemphasize the absolute critical role [applicant] plays\u201d in helping the official\ncarry out the official\u2019s duties, applicant has the official\u2019s \u201cfullest faith, trust and\nconfidence in her fidelity and loyalty to the United States of America,\u201d after reading the\nSOR and applicant\u2019s response to it the official has \u201cabsolutely no security issues with\n[applicant],\u201d and based on the official\u2019s experience, the official firmly believes granting\napplicant a security clearance is clearly consistent with the national interest.\n \n \nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\n\n3\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion\nby any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\n\n4\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.d., \u201csharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d\nLastly, under Paragraph 7.e., \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a\nforeign country . . . which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation\u201d may be disqualifying.\nApplicant\u2019s marriage to an Italian citizen raises obvious concerns under the first\nthree disqualifying conditions. Applicant\u2019s large financial interests in Italy raises\nconcerns under the fourth disqualifying condition.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s relationship\nwith her husband, standing alone, creates a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nApplicant provided insufficient credible evidence that it is unlikely she would be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of Italy and the interests of the\nUnited States, or that she is not vulnerable to a conflict of interest.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10.a., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member, such as (3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare,\nor other such benefits from a foreign country, (5) using foreign citizenship to protect\n\n5\nfinancial or business interests in another country, and (7) voting in a foreign election,\nmay be disqualifying. All three disqualifying conditions apply.\nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. I have considered them\nall and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who,\nafter becoming a naturalized United States citizen, moved back to Italy in 1981, married\nan Italian citizen in 1984, and gave birth to and raised her children in Italy. Except for\nretaining her United States citizenship and registering her children as United States\ncitizens, she has, for all intents and purposes, no current ties to the United States. In\nmost cases, these facts alone would require denial of her clearance request.\nHowever, this case does not fall in the \u201cmost cases\u201d category. This case is\nunique in the sense that a very senior United States official, who has significant\nexperience and knowledge in the security arena, has stated without equivocation that\nbased on the official\u2019s daily interaction with applicant since late 2007, applicant should\nbe granted a security clearance. This opinion, together with the fact that Italy and the\nUnited States are close allies, leads me to conclude that applicant should be granted a\nclearance based on the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nGuideline B: FOR APPLICANT\nGuideline C: FOR APPLICANT\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       \n                                      \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Mardula, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that \nApplicant mitigated security concerns under Guideline G, Alcohol Involvement. \nHowever, she failed to rebut or mitigate security concerns under Guideline E, Personal \nConduct, Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. Her \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on April 27, 2006. On July 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations, Guideline G, Alcohol Involvement, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJune 24, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n On August 12, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to   \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge.1 The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 16, 2009. On January 14, 2010, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling \nApplicant\u2019s hearing for February 3, 2010. On January 29, 2010, Applicant\u2019s counsel \nrequested a continuance because he had a death in his family. Without objection, \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was rescheduled for March 8, 2010. On that date, I convened a \nhearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. As a preliminary matter, the Government \nreported that it had not received the documents that Applicant intended to offer as \nevidence until 3:00 pm on the last business day before the hearing. By mutual \nagreement, the parties requested that the hearing be continued until 9:00 am on March \n29, 2010. I granted their request, and DOHA issued a revised notice of hearing to reflect \nthe new hearing date. \n \nWhen the hearing reconvened, the Government called no witnesses and \nintroduced 12 exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 through 12 and admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and called two witnesses. She \nintroduced 36 exhibits, which were marked as follows: Ex. A through Ex. F; Exs. G-1 \nthrough G-8; Exs. H through Z; and Ex. AA, Ex. BB, and Ex. CC. Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the March 8 hearing \non March 16, 2010 (Tr. 1).  DOHA received the transcript of the March 29 hearing on \nApril 8, 2010 (Tr. 2). \n \n  \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 14 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG E, Personal \nConduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.n); 12 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.l.); two allegations of disqualifying \nconduct under AG G, Alcohol Consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. and 3.b.); and five allegations \nof disqualifying conduct under AG J, Criminal Conduct (\u00b6\u00b6 4.a. through 4.e.). In her \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant denied 11 and admitted three of the Guideline E \nallegations; she denied all 12 of the Guideline F allegations; she denied the two \nGuideline G allegations; and she admitted three and denied two of the Guideline J \nallegations. In total, Applicant admitted the following SOR allegations: \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., \n1.m., 4.a., 4.b., and 4.c. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (SOR; \nAnswer to SOR.) \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and has never been married. She is the mother of two \ndaughters, ages seven and twelve. The father of her older child has been incarcerated \nand has not paid child support. The father of her second child pays Applicant $425 a \nmonth in child support. Applicant is pursuing undergraduate studies and hopes to attain \na degree in Information Assurance in the summer of 2011. (Ex. 1; Ex. 4 at 5; Tr. 140-\n142.) \n \n1By letter dated January 27, 2010, Applicant requested a hearing under \u00b6 4.4.3. of the Directive. Her \nwritten request that her hearing be allowed to proceed is marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant has been unemployed since October 2009. During her unemployment, \nshe received unemployment benefits. Her eligibility for unemployment benefits expired \non April 30, 2010. During her periods of unemployment, Applicant depended upon her \nmother for support. (Tr. 2 at 168, 224-225.) \n \n \nApplicant seeks restoration of her security clearance, which was suspended in \n2005 during a security clearance investigation. At the time of her hearing, she was \nneither sponsored by a government contractor for a security clearance, nor did she \nhave a need for access to classified or confidential information. By letter dated January \n27, 2010, Applicant invoked \u00b6 4.4.3. of the Directive to request that her security \nclearance hearing be permitted to proceed. (Ex. B; Tr. 1 at 7-8; Tr. 2 at 65-66; HE 1.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history begins in about 1998, after she graduated from \nhigh school. From April 1998 until July 1998, she worked as a temporary receptionist for \nan employment agency. From July 1998 until September 1998, she was employed as \nan accounts payable clerk. After two months of unemployment, she took a job as a \ncustomer service representative with a federal contractor, where she worked from \nNovember 1998 until April 2000. She left that job voluntarily, without giving notice, \nbecause she felt overwhelmed by her responsibilities. In April 2000, Applicant took a \nposition as an office assistant. She was dismissed from this job in May 2000 for a \npattern of lateness. The termination is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Ex. 1; Ex. 4 at 4; Tr. 2 at \n161-162,165-166.)   \n \n \nApplicant obtained another job in May 2000. In October 2000, she left the job \nfollowing allegations of unsatisfactory performance. From February 2001 until August \n2001, Applicant was employed as a receptionist by a federal contractor. From August \n2001 until October 2002, Applicant was employed by another federal contractor. In \nOctober 2002, Applicant changed jobs again, and worked for five months for another \ngovernment contractor before she was dismissed for a pattern of lateness. Her \ntermination is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Ex. 1; Ex. 4 at 3-4; Tr. 2 at 152.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s workplace issues were not her only concern: she also faced \nbehavioral issues in her personal life. In March 1999, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with destruction of property. Her case was nolle prossed. This behavior is \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 4.a. (Ex. 7.) \n \n \nIn November 2000, she was served with a protective order for stalking a man \nwith whom she had been romantically involved. From December 2001 to February \n2002, she stalked another ex-boyfriend. The two stalking incidents are alleged at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n. (Ex. B; Ex. 3 at 6-7; Ex. 4 at 6, 12; Ex. 5 at 2; Tr. 2 at 66-68.) \n \n \nIn 2001, when Applicant was employed by a government contractor, she was \nawarded a security clearance. After eight months with the employer, she left her job. \nShe claimed she had a personality conflict with her supervisor; the employer reported \nthat Applicant was frequently late for work, and she was not eligible for rehire. In 2004, \nApplicant accepted employment with another government contractor. In her new job, \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nshe was required to have a security clearance and to be approved for an additional level \nof access. Applicant completed a security clearance application in August 2004. On that \nform, she denied illegal drug use. In June 2005, she underwent a security clearance \ninvestigation conducted by another federal agency. During the investigation, Applicant \nstated that she had used marijuana about three times a month between 2001 and 2004. \nShe also told an authorized investigator that she used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance and after signing her employer\u2019s no-drug use policy. The agency \nthen revoked Applicant\u2019s security clearance and denied her additional access. At her \nhearing, Applicant denied ever using marijuana, and she stated that the authorized \ninvestigator who interviewed her about her drug use in 2005 erred in reporting that she \nhad used marijuana. She provided a signed and notarized statement of intent never to \nuse illegal drugs. In her statement of intent, she consented to automatic revocation of \nher security clearance if she were to use illegal drugs in the future.2 Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement and the agency\u2019s decision to revoke her clearance and deny her additional \naccess are alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.d.  (Ex. A; Ex. B at 2; Ex. 3 at 4, 6-7; Ex. 4 at \n4; Tr. 2 at 62-63, 157-158, 174-175, 183-185, 224.)  \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of the letter she received on November 25, 2005, from \nan adjudicator at the other government agency. The letter read, in pertinent part, as \nfollows:   \n \nDuring your security testing session . . . you stated that you smoked \nmarijuana about three times a month between 2001 and August 2004.You \nadvised that you held a [security] clearance during this timeframe. You \nacknowledged that you knew it was wrong to use marijuana while holding \na security clearance, and added that you had also signed a no-drug policy \nstatement for your employer. \n  \n(Ex. B; Ex. 3 at 6-7.) \n \n \nBy letter dated March 1, 2006, Applicant requested that the agency review its \ndetermination to revoke her security clearance and deny her additional access. The \nagency acknowledged receipt of her request and advised her that she would be notified \nin writing of the outcome of her appeal. Applicant stated that she had not received a \ndecision on her appeal from the agency. She concluded that the agency had reversed \nits initial decision and restored her security clearance. (Ex. C; Ex. D; Tr. 72-74.) \n \n \nIn March 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery. The \ncharge was nolle prossed. In May 2008, she was arrested and charged with driving \nwhile intoxicated. She was found guilty of reckless driving. Her driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended for six months. She was also sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended; \nordered to attend an alcohol safety awareness program; and fined. She completed the \nalcohol safety awareness program in December 2008. In September 2008, Applicant \n \n2 Applicant testified that she had not provided a copy of her signed statement of intent to her employer. \n(Tr. 2 at 216-217.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nwas cited for drinking in public. She attended a Labor Day picnic in a park and was \napprehended by a park ranger as she opened a can of beer. She paid a fine and court \ncosts. In November 2008, a friend of Applicant\u2019s borrowed her car and altered her \nlicense tags. Applicant was charged with possession of forged license tags. She was \nfound not guilty of the offense. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the drinking \nin public and possession of forged license tags charges alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.d. and 4.e. \nAt her hearing, she admitted the underlying conduct, but denied the forged license tag \ncharge because she was found not guilty. She denied the drinking in public charge \nbecause she did not believe she had been arrested. These arrests, charges, and \ncitations are alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.b., 4.c., 4.d., and 4.e. (Ex. W; Ex. X; Ex. Y; Ex. Z; Ex. \nAA; Ex. CC; Ex. 4 at 5-6; Ex. 5 at 1-2; Ex. 8; Tr. 2 at 123-124, 189-196.)     \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant is responsible for 12 delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $31,752. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all 12  \ndelinquencies. However, in her direct testimony and in cross examination, Applicant \nadmitted all 12 delinquent debts. The evidence established that the following debts had \nnot been satisfied: a judgment for $4,150, dating to 2003, for a repossessed vehicle \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a.); a $1,544 debt to an educational institution, charged off in about 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b.); a judgment for $14,272, entered against Applicant in 2007, for a \nrepossessed vehicle (SOR \u00b6 2.c.); a $2,670 debt, in collection status, owed to a creditor \nthat evicted Applicant for failure to pay her rent in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.g.); and a $273 \nmedical debt, placed in collection status in about August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.i.)3 (Ex. I; Ex. \nM; Tr. 2 at 93-96, 101-102, 200-203, 208, 210-211.)  \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant admitted that a $4,141 student loan debt, alleged at SOR \n\u00b6 2.d., had not been satisfied. Her Ex. J established that the student loan creditor had \noffered to settle the debt in November 2009 for $2,210. Her Ex. K established that the \noutstanding principal on her student loans was approximately $16,000, and because \nshe had recently enrolled in higher education, the creditor had deferred payment of her \nstudent loans. (Ex. J; Ex. K; Tr. 2 at 89-92, 203-207.) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged the $1,348 delinquent debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.e. She \nclaimed she had settled the debt for $700 in 2006. However, she reported that the \ncreditor had no record of her payment. She stated she would pay the debt in the future. \n(Ex. I; Tr. 2 at 96-97, 208.) \n \n \nApplicant asserted that the $391 delinquent medical account alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n2.f. was a duplicate of a $388 delinquent medical account alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.h. \nHowever, Applicant failed to provide documentation to establish that the accounts were \nthe same. (Ex. I; Ex. L; Tr. 2 at 97-100, 209-210.) \n \n \n3 Applicant stated she had a payment plan with the creditor identified in SOR \u00b6 2.g. and would pay the \ndebt at a future time. Applicant\u2019s Ex. M indicated that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 2. i. had not been paid. \n(Ex. M; Tr. 2 at 208-210.) \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 2.k. that Applicant was indebted to a state unemployment \ncommission for a $1,029 overpayment of unemployment compensation. Applicant \nprovided documentation establishing that her subsequent unemployment compensation \nhad been garnished to satisfy the overpayment. (Ex. T; Ex. U; Tr. 2 at 109-113, 169-\n172.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 2.j. that Applicant owed a $623 delinquent debt to a \ncreditor on an account placed for collection in January 2007. Applicant provided \ndocumentation establishing that she had made payments which reduced the current \nbalance due to $123. (Ex. I; Ex. P; Ex. Q; Ex. R; Ex. S; Tr. 2 at 104, 108, 211-212.) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged at \u00b6 2.l. that Applicant owed a delinquent medical debt of \n$468 that had not been satisfied. Applicant provided documentation to establish that \nshe had made payments on the debt which reduced the current balance to $218. (Ex. I; \nEx. N; Ex. O; Ex. V; Tr. 2 at 105-107, 212-213.)    \n \n \n \nApplicant completed, signed, and certified an e-QIP on April 27, 2006. She \nsigned the following certification after completion of her e-QIP: \n \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good \nfaith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form \ncan be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title \n18, United States Code). \n \n(Ex. 1 at 44.) \n \n \nSection 24 on the e-QIP seeks information on an applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs \nand drug activity. It contains the following advisory: \n \nThe following questions pertain to the illegal use of drugs or drug activity. \nYou are required to answer the questions fully and truthfully, and your \nfailure to do so could be grounds for an adverse employment decision or \naction against you, but neither your truthful responses nor information \nderived from your responses will be used as evidence against you in any \nsubsequent criminal proceeding.  \n \n(Ex. 1 at  38.) \n \n \nQuestion 24a on the e-QIP reads: \n \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquillizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(Ex. 1 at 38.) \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 24a. She did not acknowledge using \nmarijuana three times a month from about 2001 to 2004. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose \nthe information about her marijuana use is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. (Ex. 1 at 38.) \n \nQuestion 24b on the e-QIP reads: \n \nHave you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a \nlaw enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while \npossessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and \nimmediately affecting the public safety? \n \n (Ex. 1 at 38.) \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 24b. She did not acknowledge using \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance.  Her failure to disclose her marijuana use \nwhile holding a security clearance is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. (Ex. 1 at 38.) \n \n \nQuestion 26b on the e-QIP inquires about an individual\u2019s investigative record and \nreads: \u201cTo your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or access authorization \ndenied, suspended, or revoked, or have you been disbarred from government \nemployment? If \u201cYes,\u201d give date of action and agency.\u201d (Ex. 1 at 39.) \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 26b. She did not acknowledge that she was \ndenied additional access and her security clearance was revoked by another \nGovernment agency in November 2005. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose that she had \nbeen denied additional access and that her security clearance had been revoked by \naction of another Government agency in November 2005 is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g. (Ex. 1 \nat 40.) \n \n \nOn April 23, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator from \nthe U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During her interview, Applicant stated \nthat she had failed a question in her interview with another federal agency regarding her \nuse of marijuana. She stated to the investigator that she had not used marijuana and \ndid not understand why she failed the question. She did not disclose her marijuana use \nbetween 2001 and 2004. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose her marijuana use to the \nauthorized investigator on April 23, 2007 is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h.  (Ex. 4 at 3.) \n \n \nIn the same interview, Applicant stated that she had never been denied a \nsecurity clearance. She failed to disclose to the investigator that she had been denied \nadditional access by another federal agency and that her security clearance had been \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \nrevoked in about November 2005. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose this information is \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i. (Ex. 4 at 3.)4 \n \n \nOn August 27, 2008, Applicant was interviewed again by an OPM investigator. \nDuring this interview, she stated that she had never used any illegal drugs. She did not \ndisclose her use of marijuana from 2001 to 2004. Her failure to disclose her marijuana \nuse to the authorized investigator on August 27, 2008, is alleged in the SOR at \u00b6 1.j. \n(Ex. 4 at 13.) \n \n \nOn September 26, 2008, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to an \nOPM investigator. In that statement, she stated that she never used marijuana or any \nother illegal drug. She failed to disclose her use of the illegal drug marijuana from 2001 \nto 2004.  Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose her marijuana use in her signed, sworn \nstatement is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k. Additionally, Applicant testified at her security \nclearance hearing on March 29, 2010, that she had never used marijuana. (Ex. 5 at 2-4; \nTr. 2 at 224.) \n \n \nIn her September 26, 2008 signed, sworn statement to the authorized OPM \ninvestigator, Applicant disclosed she was arrested in June 2008 and charged with a \ncriminal offense related to alcohol consumption. However, she failed to disclose that \nearlier that month, on September 1, 2008, she had been cited for drinking in public. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose her citation for drinking in public is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.l. At \nher hearing, Applicant testified that she told the investigator about her drinking in public \ncitation, but he did not include it in the statement. (Ex. 2; Ex. 5 at 1-12; Tr. 2 at 126.) \n \n  \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator in April 2007, she \nprovided information about her alcohol use.  In January 2009, in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories, she affirmed that the following information was accurate: \n \nSubject occasionally drinks alcohol to the point of intoxication an average \nof three or four times per year. Subject drinks long island iced teas [a \nmixed drink containing alcohol] when out with her friends at bars \napproximately once or twice a month. When drinking to the point of \nintoxication, this includes three drinks and subject becomes tipsy and \ndances for fun. She does not black [out] or become violent. Subject drinks \nalcohol for celebration. Subject does not consider her alcohol use a \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s statements about the revocation of her security clearance and denial of higher-level access \nare ambiguous and contradictory. In a personal subject interview in August 2008, she stated that she \nappealed the denial of her security clearance and lost the appeal. She reported that she was told she \ncould repeat the security investigation in one or two years. (Ex. 4 at 13.) In response to DOHA \ninterrogatories in January 2009, she stated that she appealed the earlier revocation of her clearance, her \nappeal was granted, and her clearance was granted. However, she also attached the letter from the other \nGovernment agency informing her that she had been disapproved for additional access to classified \ninformation and her existing security clearance had been revoked for drug involvement and personal \nconduct issues. That letter is dated November 25, 2005. (Ex. 3 at 5; Ex. B.)  Applicant provided a signed, \nsworn statement in which she stated that she did not know when she completed and certified her e-QIP in \nApril 2006 that her clearance had been suspended, denied, or revoked. (Ex. 5 at 5.) \n\n \n9 \n \n \nproblem and it has not had any impact on her professional life, home life, \nher physical or emotional health and she has not had any arrests or \ncriminal activity related to her alcohol use. Her alcohol use is not \nsomething that could leave her susceptible to blackmail or coercion. \n \n(Ex. 4 at 5, 18.) \n \n \nIn August 2008, when she was again interviewed by an OPM investigator, \nApplicant discussed her arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol in June 2008, \nand her use of alcohol since about the year 2000. In January 2009, again in response to \nDOHA interrogatories, Applicant affirmed that the information which follows was \naccurate: \n \nSubject first consumed alcohol at age 21 at her 21st birthday party. From \nage 21 to 23 the subject would only drink about once every 6 months and \nwas intoxicated twice. From 23 to 25 the subject would only drink about \nonce every six months and was not intoxicated during this time. From 25 \nto 27 the subject would have some alcohol about once every other week, \nmainly one or two drinks. Subject did not get intoxicated. From age 27 to \npresent the subject will drink about 4 times a year and has not been \nintoxicated. The subject is not addicted to alcohol and has not sought \ncounseling. Subject\u2019s alcohol use has not caused issues with friends, \nfamily finances, school, or work. Subject has not experienced any \nnegative personality changes because of the alcohol.  \n \n(Ex. 4 at 15-16, 18.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges at \u00b6 3.a. that Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess \nand to the point of intoxication, from approximately March 2000 to at least August 2008. \nThe SOR also cross-alleges at \u00b6 3.b. that Applicant\u2019s arrest in May 2008 for driving \nwhile intoxicated and her citation for drinking in public in September 2008 raise security \nconcerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant \ndenied the two alcohol consumption allegations. (SOR; Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant repeated her denials to SOR allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. and \n3.b. She stated that while she was initially charged with driving while intoxicated, she \nwas convicted of reckless driving. She also stated her understanding that she was not \narrested and charged with drinking in public, but, instead, was cited for the offense and \npaid a fine in lieu of a court appearance. She denied consuming alcohol to the point of \nintoxication. She further stated: \u201cI did consume alcohol to relax me and that would \nprobably be a bottle of cheap champagne, Merlot, one bottle every two months. \u201c In \nDecember 2008, Applicant completed an alcohol safety awareness program. She stated \nat her hearing that she no longer consumes alcohol. She stated that she last consumed \nalcohol in September or October 2008.  (Ex. 2 at 8; Tr. 2 at 117-127, 192.) \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor appeared as a character witness on her behalf.  He \nworked with Applicant for about seven or eight months before he left the company. He \ntestified that, in his opinion, Applicant was motivated, conscientious, and exercised \ngood judgment.  (Tr. 2 at 35-42.) \n \n \nA former coworker also appeared as a character witness for Applicant. She \ntestified that she had known Applicant for approximately nine months. She stated that, \nin her opinion, Applicant was diligent, thorough in her work, and followed established \nrules and regulations. (Tr. 2 at 47-52.) \n \n \nIn the first nine months of 2009, Applicant earned approximately $58,000. Since \nlosing her job in October 2009, she receives approximately $414 in unemployment \ncompensation for herself and her two children each week.5 Each month, she also \nreceives $550 in child support and $243 in food stamps. (Tr. 2 at 230-235.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly rent is $1,500 and her monthly car payment is $425. Her \nmother pays her utility bills and car insurance. Applicant\u2019s mother, who is handicapped, \nplans to retire and move in with Applicant and her children. She will pay Applicant $700 \ntoward the monthly rent until Applicant finds a job. Applicant asks her sister to help her \nbuy gasoline. (Tr. 2 at 231-234, 241.) \n \n \n                                                 Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n \n5 At the suggestion of Applicant\u2019s counsel, I multiplied her weekly unemployment compensation by 4.3 to \narrive at a monthly amount of $1,780. (Tr. 2 at 233.)  \n\n \n11 \n \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nIn 2000, Applicant was fired from a job because she was frequently late for work. \nThat same year, a former boyfriend obtained a protective order to prevent Applicant \nfrom stalking him. Applicant stalked another former boyfriend in 2001 and 2002. In \n2003, Applicant was fired from another job for attendance issues. This conduct \nsuggests a pattern of unreliability and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. \n \nIn about November 2001, Applicant was granted a security clearance. In 2004, \nher employer recommended her for additional access, and she completed a security \nclearance application in which she denied illegal drug use.  In 2005, during her security \nclearance investigation, Applicant admitted using marijuana about three times a month \nbetween 2001 and August 2004, while holding a security clearance. In about November \n2005, she was denied additional access and her security clearance was revoked. \n \nIn April 2006, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In response \nto Questions 24a, 24b, and 26b on that SF-86, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d, thereby \ndenying any drug use since the age of 16 or in the last seven years, any drug use while \nholding a security clearance, and any previous revocation, suspension, or denial of her \nsecurity clearance.   \n \nIn interviews with authorized investigators in April 2007 and August 2008, \nApplicant stated that she had never used marijuana, and she failed to disclose her \nmarijuana use from 2001 to 2004. In her April 2007 interview with an authorized \ninvestigator, she also failed to disclose that she was denied additional access and her \nsecurity clearance was revoked by another government agency in November 2005. \n \nOn September 26, 2008, Applicant was again interviewed by an investigator who \nassisted her in the preparation of a signed, sworn statement. In her signed, sworn \nstatement, Applicant stated that she never used marijuana or any other illegal drugs. \nShe failed to disclose her marijuana use between 2001 and 2004. She also failed to \ndisclose that she had been cited for drinking in public on September 1, 2008.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct raises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), \n16(c), and 16(e)(1). AG 16(a) reads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification \nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(b) reads: \u201cdeliberately providing false or \nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security \nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) reads: \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nadjudicative guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole- \nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \n\n \n13 \n \n \nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n16(e)(1), reads in pertinent part as follows: \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of \ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d   \n \n \nThe disqualifying personal conduct alleged in the SOR occurred between 2000 \nand 2008. From 2000 to 2002, Applicant stalked two former boyfriends, and in 2000 and \n2003, she was terminated from two jobs for lateness and attendance issues. These \nevents, which occurred over seven years ago, when viewed as a whole with other more \nrecent personal conduct allegations, raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(c). As a \nwhole, the events indicate, under a whole-person assessment, questionable judgment, \nunreliability, lack of candor, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, \nsuggesting that Applicant may not properly safeguard protected information. \n \nAfter being granted a security clearance in 2001, Applicant used marijuana about \nthree times a month between 2001 and 2004. In November 2005, her security clearance \nwas revoked and she was denied additional access as the result of her personal \nconduct and her drug involvement. These facts raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n16(e)(1).  \n \n \nWhen she completed and signed her e-QIP in April 2006, Applicant falsified her \nresponses to the e-QIP by failing to disclose her marijuana use and her drug use while \nholding a security clearance. She also failed to disclose that another Government \nagency disapproved her request for additional access and revoked her clearance \nbecause of her drug involvement and personal conduct issues. On three separate \noccasions, in April 2007, August 2008, and September 2008, when she was interviewed \nby OPM investigators, Applicant failed to disclose her marijuana use from 2001 to 2004. \nAdditionally, in 2007, she failed to disclose that she had been denied additional access \nand her security clearance had been revoked by another federal agency in November \n2005. In her signed, sworn statement of September 26, 2008,  Applicant again falsified \nher response by denying ever using illegal drugs. Additionally, she failed to disclose that \nshe had been cited for drinking alcohol in public. After a thorough examination of the \nrecord, carefully observing Applicant, and listening to and reading her testimony, I \nconclude that her falsifications of her April 2006 e-QIP were deliberate. I also conclude \nthat she deliberately provided false or misleading information concerning relevant facts \nabout her marijuana use, her drug use while holding a security clearance, and the \nrevocation of her security clearance and denial of additional access to the authorized \ninvestigators who interviewed her on April 23, 2007 and August 27, 2008. Further, I \nconclude that Applicant falsified her signed, sworn statement of September 26, 2008, by \nstating that she never used marijuana or any illegal drugs and by failing to disclose a \ncitation for drinking in public.   \n \nI have carefully reviewed the several mitigating conditions under Guideline E. I \nconclude that none of the mitigating conditions applies in this case. \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18: \n       \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns.   \n \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debt that remained unsatisfied for several \nyears. She was unable or unwilling to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several mitigating conditions could apply to \nthe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. If the financially \ndelinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might apply. If \n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply. If \u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply. If \u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d then \nAG \u00b6 20(d) might apply. Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies date to at least 2003, \nand they have continued to the present. Moreover, Applicant now lacks sufficient \nfinancial resources to meet her family\u2019s basic needs and must rely upon her mother for \nadditional support. Applicant owes over $31,000 in delinquent debts, which she cannot \nsatisfy. To her credit, she provided documentation to establish that she was paying \ndown the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.j. and 2.l. However, the record suggests that her \n\n \n15 \n \n \nfinancial difficulties occurred under circumstances that are likely to recur, and they cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nThe record does not include facts that suggest protracted conditions beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control that would explain her failure over a period of years to meet her \nfinancial obligations. While she experienced periodic unemployment and the challenges \nof raising two children as a single parent, she is also pursuing a college degree.  \n \nApplicant stated that she intends to satisfy several of her creditors in the future. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s intention to satisfy her creditors is laudable, she has failed to \ndemonstrate a track record of financial responsibility. She has not yet demonstrated \npriorities that emphasize paying her existing debts and avoiding additional financial \ndelinquencies in the future. While I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply in part to \nthe facts of Applicant\u2019s case, I also conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), and 20(e) do not \napply to her case.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, applies in this case to a determination of \neligibility for access to classified information. Under Guideline G, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability.\u201d \n \n I have considered all of the Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions.  I \nhave especially considered AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). AG \u00b6  22(a) reads: \u201calcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n22(c) reads: \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent.\u201d   \n \nApplicant began to consume alcohol in about 2000, when she was 21 years old. \nIn April 2007, she reported that she occasionally drank alcohol to intoxication three or \nfour times a year. She drank when she went out with her friends once or twice a month. \nShe did not consider her alcohol use a problem. In August 2008, she reported to an \nauthorized investigator that, since the age of 27, she had consumed alcohol about four \ntimes a year and had not been intoxicated. \n \nIn June 2008, Applicant was arrested for the first and only time for driving under \nthe influence of alcohol. She was found guilty of reckless driving and ordered to take \npart in an alcohol safety awareness education program. In September 2008, she was \ncited for drinking in public at a Labor Day picnic in a park. These facts raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). \n \n\n \n16 \n \n \nThe Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(a) if \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The disqualifying \nconduct could also be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(b) if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d  If \u201cthe individual is a current \nemployee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of \nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress,\u201d then AG \u00b6 23(c) \nmight apply.  Finally, mitigation might be possible under AG \u00b6 23 (d) if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d  \n \n \n \nApplicant is now 31 years old. In June 2008, she was arrested and charged with \ndriving under the influence of alcohol. Three months later, in September 2008, she was \ncited for drinking in public. These alcohol-related incidents are relatively recent. \n \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant successfully completed an alcohol safety \nawareness program. Nothing in the record suggests that Applicant has been diagnosed \nas an abuser of alcohol or as alcohol dependent. She last consumed alcohol in \nSeptember or October 2008. At her hearing, she reported that she no longer drinks \nalcohol. I conclude that AG \u00b6 23 (a) applies in mitigation in this case: Applicant\u2019s alcohol \ninvolvement behavior, while recent, reflected infrequent use, happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \n \nApplicant admits a history of criminal conduct that spans nine years. In 1999, she \nwas arrested and charged with destruction of property. The charge was nolle prossed. \nIn 2006, she was arrested and charged with assault and battery. That charge was also \nnolle prossed.  In May 2008, she was arrested for driving while intoxicated. She was \nfound guilty of reckless driving, was sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended, and \nordered to attend an alcohol education program. Her driver\u2019s license was suspended for \nsix months, and she was fined.  Despite Applicant\u2019s initial denials, the record evidence \n\n \n17 \n \n \nestablished Applicant\u2019s drinking in public charge and the charge that she was in \npossession of forged license plates. This behavior raises concerns under AG \u00b6 31(a) \nand AG \u00b6 31(c). AG \u00b6 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31(c) reads: \u201callegation or admission or criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \n \n \nThe record establishes that Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior began in 1999 and  \ncontinued to at least 2008. Her criminal conduct is, therefore, recent. Two witnesses \noffered character testimony on behalf of Applicant and stated that they thought she was \ntrustworthy and reliable. However, in her answers to the SOR, Applicant denied two \ncriminal conduct allegations for narrow reasons, even though, at her hearing, she \nacknowledged the truth of the underlying conduct alleged. Applicant\u2019s denials suggest \nthat she has not fully acknowledged responsibility for her conduct, which, in turn, raises \ncontinuing security concerns about her lack of remorse and rehabilitation. Applicant\u2019s \nlong-standing pattern of criminal behavior continues to cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  I conclude that neither AG \u00b6 32(a) nor AG \u00b6 32 (d) \napplies. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n\n \n18 \n \n \n    I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I observed Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor closely at her hearing, and I listened carefully to her testimony. My review of \nthe record reveals that Applicant has worked hard to acquire an education and to care \nfor her two daughters. She has had difficulties in maintaining steady employment and in \npaying her creditors. \n \n When she answered the 12 financial allegations in the SOR, Applicant denied all \nof them. However, in direct testimony and in cross-examination, she admitted the \nallegations and acknowledged that the debts were her responsibility. She also denied \nthe criminal conduct allegations alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 4. d. and 4.e., and yet she admitted the \nunderlying allegations. Applicant\u2019s conduct suggested that she is not committed to \nanswering truthfully and uses denial as a tactic. \n \nApplicant completed her e-QIP in April 2006, just five months after receiving a \nletter from another Government agency revoking her security clearance and denying \nher additional access because of drug use and personal conduct issues. However, \nApplicant failed to report her marijuana use between 2001 and 2004, which occurred \nwhile she held a security clearance. She also failed to report that her security clearance \nhad been revoked in November 2005. I conclude that her failure to report this \ninformation on her e-QIP was a deliberate attempt to mislead the Government.  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant provided false and misleading information about her drug \nuse and the revocation of her security clearance to OPM investigators during security \nclearance investigations in April 2007 and in August and September 2008. I conclude \nthat Applicant deliberately failed to give truthful answers to the investigators and was \nnot a credible witness. Moreover, her failure to tell the truth about her drug use and the \nrevocation of her security clearance continued during her security clearance hearing on \nMarch 29, 2010.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to give truthful answers on her e-QIP, during three interviews \nwith authorized investigators, and at her hearing raises serious concerns about her \ncredibility and her vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. It also \nsuggests that she may not know how to respond truthfully in other situations, raising the \nlikelihood that she may continue to be untruthful in the future. Because the Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information, it must be able to rely, with confidence, on their capacity to act \nhonorably and report truthfully. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude, \nafter a careful review of the facts of her case, the adjudicative guidelines, and the \nwhole-person concept, that Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom her personal conduct, financial delinquencies, and criminal conduct. \n \n \n\n \n19 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n           Paragraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a. - 1.n.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n           AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs  2.a. - 2.i.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 2.j. -  2.l.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:   \n           FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n       Subparagraphs 3.a. - 3.b.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 4: Guideline J:                        AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n       Subparagraphs 4. a. - 4.e.:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge:\nOn May 23, 2007, Applicant submitted his Electronic Security Clearance\nApplication (e-QIP or SF 86). On March 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 21, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 5, 2008, and requested his case be decided on the written\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. \nAugust 14, 2008\n\n2\nOn April 24, 2008, Department Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s written case.\nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant.\nHe was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant did not file a response to the FORM within the 30\nday time allowed that would have expired on June 6, 2008. \nI received the case assignment on July 22, 2008.  The Government offered Items\n1 through 7.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f through 1.h of the SOR, with explanations. He denied\nthe factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e of the SOR. He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant is 52 years old.  He has three adult children, and one minor child.  He\nis married, but separated since 2002 from his wife.  A divorce is pending.  Applicant\nworks for a defense contractor, and his gross income every two weeks is $,1323.07.\n(Items 4-6)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes eight delinquent debts.  He admits five of them,\nand denies three.  The denied delinquent debts are to be paid by his wife after the\ndivorce, but there is no divorce finalized and no divorce decree specifically stating the\ndebts are allocated in that manner.  Applicant denies receiving any notices of collection\nor delinquency in the six years he and his wife have been separated.  The delinquent\ndebts listed in the SOR appear on Applicant\u2019s January 14, 2008, credit report. (Items 1,\n4-6)\nThe delinquent debts Applicant admits he owes, and on which he has taken no\naction to pay in whole or in part by installment plan, are as follows:\n1. A credit card debt for $6,370, charged off in March 2004. (\u00b6 1.a)\n2. Another bank credit card debt for $7,722, charged off in December,\n2003. (\u00b6 1.c)\n3. A collection agency for a bank debt of $9,617, placed for collection in\nDecember 2005. (\u00b6 1.f)\n4. The U.S. treasury for overpaid leave, $1,660, over 120 days delinquent\nas of March 2006. (\u00b6 1.g)\n5. The U.S. treasury for overpaid leave, $2,124, placed for collection in\nJune 2004. (\u00b6 1.h) The total amount owed for these debts is $27,503.\n(Items 1, 4-7)\nThe delinquent debts Applicant denies being his responsibility because he claims\nthey were incurred by his wife, even though they appear on his credit record.  They are:\n\n3\n1. A collection service for a cell telephone debt, in the amount of $371,\nplaced for collection in April 2004. (\u00b6 1.b)\n2. A collection service debt for an insurance bill in the amount of $164,\nplaced for collection in December 2003. (\u00b6 1.d)\n3. Another collection agency for another cell telephone bill in the amount\nof $372, placed for collection in November 2005. (\u00b6 1.e) The total amount\nof these three debts is $907.  (Items 1, 4-7)\nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement dated February 9, 2008, submitted with\nhis answers to the DOHA Interrogatories, shows a net monthly remainder of income of\n$280.  Applicant did not include any debt repayments on the financial statement as a\ndeduction, showing he is not repaying any delinquent debts. (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.I) (Item\n6)\nApplicant answered Questions 28 a. (In the last seven years, have you been over\n180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?), and 28.b. (Are you currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?) on the e-QIP  with negative responses.  Applicant certified\non that form that his answers to all questions were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the\nbest of (his) knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.\u201d  In fact, these two\nanswers were false because Applicant owed the debts listed in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. to 1.h.\nApplicant claims any delinquency notice may have gone to his wife\u2019s address, and he\nnever received them.  He admitted he \u201cshould have been more diligent in regards to my\nfinancial affairs. (Items 4 and 5)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an\napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section\n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and took no action\nin the past five years to pay these obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose between 1999 and February 2004. He accumulated substantial\ndelinquent debt due to his spending habits.  I find that because the behavior occurred\nunder normal circumstances it is likely to recur, and  does raise concerns about his\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence does not raise or\nsupport this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Some of these\ndelinquent debts arose before his marital separation in 2002.  Since then Applicant has\ntaken no action to resolve or identify these debts in a responsible manner. I consider his\nexplanation for not paying the $907 of telephone and insurance bills not to be\npersuasive, as these debts are properly his to pay. I find this potentially mitigating\ncondition is not a factor for consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant did not seek or attend counseling.  He has not\nresolved any of the delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. He is not\nfinancially sound and is unprepared for future contingencies. I conclude these\npotentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 16(a), \u201cinvolving deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, or determine\n\n6\ntrustworthiness\u201d, is potentially disqualifying.   Applicant failed to disclose over $28,000 in\ndelinquent debt.  He admitted he failed to keep track of his debts for the past six years.\nThe personal conduct guideline also includes examples of conditions that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct.  Under AG & 17(a), it may be\nmitigating where \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted by the facts.\u201d  Here, there is no\nevidence from Applicant that he took such action.  This mitigating condition does not\napply.  The remaining six mitigating conditions do not apply based on the record\nevidence. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge considers the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant was a mature adult and\nparent, who spent about $28,000 and consistently failed to repay it over the past six\nyears.  He has not changed his behavior in those years, and did not make any attempts\nto repay even the smallest debts.  He admits he has not been diligent in managing his\nfinancial affairs. This lack of responsibility for his finances, and his deliberate failure to\ndisclose his debts to the Government on the e-QIP, raise substantial questions about\nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. While\nthese significant debts remain unpaid, and his veracity is shown to be lacking, they are\nsufficient reasons to raise security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with great questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\nagainst Applicant.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_____________________\nPHILIP S. HOWE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He also admitted being involved in bankruptcy proceedings between June 1992 and June 1993, when he received a complete chapter 7 discharge of his dischargeable debts. Despite his bankruptcy discharge in June 1993, Applicant has continued to have financial problems. He attributes these problems to periods of unemployment, underemployment, and his wife\u2019s unemployment. Additionally, he has been divorced twice and the financial pressures of that process and the concomitant child support orders have inhibited his ability to stay current on his accounts. When he married for the third time in November 2005, both he and his wife brought delinquent debt to the marriage.

He also\nadmitted being involved in bankruptcy proceedings between June 1992 and June 1993,\nwhen he received a complete chapter 7 discharge of his dischargeable debts.\n Despite his bankruptcy discharge in June 1993, Applicant has continued to have\nfinancial problems. He attributes these problems to periods of unemployment,\nunderemployment, and his wife\u2019s unemployment. Additionally, he has been divorced\ntwice and the financial pressures of that process and the concomitant child support\norders have inhibited his ability to stay current on his accounts. When he married for the\nthird time in November 2005, both he and his wife brought delinquent debt to the\nmarriage.\nApplicant has been employed, at varying levels of authority, as a security guard\nfor many years. He generally works two jobs in order to earn sufficient income to\nsupport his family. Security work is a profession that frequently involves high turnover\nrates among personnel, wages that generally require an individual to work two or more\njobs to make ends meet, cycles of layoffs when the employer loses the government\ncontract that employs it, and regular rehiring of former employees\u2014regardless of the\nreason the employee left the company.\nOver the years, Applicant has been subject to the vicissitudes of his profession.\nOn four occasions, he has been fired or removed from the agency work site because of\nrecorded misconduct: September 2000 (removed), October 2002 (fired), March 2004\n(fired), and April 2007 (fired). In each of these instances, Applicant has a version of\nevents that conflicts with the employers\u2019 version, but does not dispute that the adverse\naction was taken by the employer. And while Applicant denies or minimizes the specific\nincident that precipitated each adverse action, the record evidence reflects that each\nadverse action was based in part on other misconduct documented by the employer.3\nWhen Applicant completed a public trust questionnaire in November 2005 and\nMarch 2006 (GE 2), he failed to disclose the adverse employment actions in September\n\n3\n2000, October 2002, and March 2004. He also failed to disclose numerous delinquent\ndebts. When Applicant applied for a security clearance in October 2005 (GE 1),  he\nconcealed the same information. Although he denied any intent to mislead the\ngovernment, he admitted that he knew he was fired from several positions and that he\nwas required to disclose that fact (Tr. 258-260). \nRegarding the October 2005 clearance application, he also claimed to rely on the\nadvice of his facility security officer who allegedly told him to answer \u201cno\u201d to the\npertinent questions (because a \u201cyes\u201d answer required explanation and Applicant did not\nhave the details immediately available to him) and explain it during the later subject\ninterview. However, he also admitted that this was not the first time he had applied for a\nclearance, and he knew he was required to give truthful answers to the questions. In\naddition to his failure to disclose adverse information on his public trust and clearance\ndocuments, Applicant also failed to provide releases required to facilitate his\nbackground investigation between June-August 2006. He explained that he did not\nmean to be uncooperative, but was consumed by the press of other business.\nAt hearing, Applicant provided evidence that he had been making regular\npayments on the child support obligations at SOR 1.e. and 1.q. He was not making\npayments on the large judgment against him in SOR 1.a. The remainder of his debts he\nwas addressing through a credit firm he began working with in December 2007.\nAlthough the program includes some counseling and education on developing good\nfinancial habits, including a budget, the firm advertises itself as a credit repair operation.\nOn the advice of the program representative, he has been advised to make no\npayments on any of his delinquent accounts\u2014not because the debts are not his or he\ndoes not owe the money, but because the program seeks to have the accounts\nremoved from Applicant\u2019s credit reports based on the time the accounts have been\ninactive. In this fashion, Applicant has succeeded in removing some accounts that he\nclaims are not his and a number of accounts that he acknowledges owing. Some\naccounts have not had responses from the credit agency. \nOnce he has had as many accounts removed from his credit report as he can, he\nwill make arrangements to repay the remaining creditors. Several of the accounts that\nno longer appear on his credit report are accounts that the credit reporting agencies\nconfirmed as valid debts in Applicant\u2019s name. However, Applicant confirmed that a\ncurrent credit report would show new delinquencies not alleged in the SOR, at least one\nof which is a default on an instant loan Applicant obtained to deal with short-term cash\nflow issues (Tr. 278).\nApplicants witnesses consider him a reliable and trustworthy individual who\nshould have his clearance. Similarly, his work and character references (AE M)\nrecommend him for his clearance. However, it does not appear that any of them are\naware of the issues in this case.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n5\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . . (e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis;\n4\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\njudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial commonsense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guidelines\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although Applicant obtained a\ncomplete discharge of his dischargeable debt in June 1993, he has been unable to get,\nand keep, his financial house in order.  To some extent, this has been due to\n5\ncircumstances beyond his control with his divorces and periods of unemployment,\nunderemployment, and his wife\u2019s unemployment. However, to the extent that his\nperiods of unemployment or underemployment were due to adverse employment\nactions occasioned by his misconduct, his financial problems were not due to\n\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20.(c)the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n8\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n9\n5\ncircumstances beyond his control. Further, there is one major debt (SOR 1.a.) that\nApplicant acknowledges but has not addressed in any fashion. In addition, he continues\nto acquire new delinquent debt.  Finally, although the credit repair program Applicant\nentered may be lawful, it is not responsible. It remains to be seen what debts are\neventually removed from his credit reports and what debts will be repaid, it is\nincomplete. Unlike an established repayment plan, or a plan to address debts serially,\nthere is no reasonable certainty that Applicant will resolve his delinquent debts, much\nless when that might be accomplished. This is a plan to avoid his debts, not resolve\nthem.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were not entirely due to\n6\ncircumstances beyond his control, and he has not acted responsibly in addressing his\ndebts.  The credit repair program he entered does not really involve credit counseling ,\n7\nand as he is still in the middle of that program he cannot be said to have otherwise\nbrought the problem under control.  As he has not made any payments to his creditors,\n8\nincluding the judgment creditor that falls outside his credit repair program, he has not\nmade a good-faith effort to satisfy his debts.9\nFurther, given his selection of a program that is not designed to address his\ndebts but only to avoid them, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will\nput his financial problems behind him. The government\u2019s documents adequately\nestablish Applicant\u2019s responsibility for most of the debts in the SOR. Despite the denials\nin his answer, he had previously admitted and acknowledged at hearing, his legal\nresponsibility for the debts. Thus, he had the burden to establish that he had resolved\nthe debts or had a legitimate reason to dispute them. He did neither. I conclude\nGuideline F against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s employment adventures\nraise serious security concerns. Distilled to its essence, Applicant\u2019s misconduct\ndemonstrates a consistent pattern of poor judgment. He has been unable or unwilling to\nfollow basic commonsense requirements in the workplace. Compounding these\nexamples of poor judgment is his inability or unwillingness to see that these incidents\ndemonstrate poor judgment\u2014in itself a demonstration of poor judgment or poor\n\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n10\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. . . ;\n\u00b6 16.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n11\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n12\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n6\nperception.  In his mind, none of these incidents are really his fault, even partially. It\n10\nmay be that one or more of these incidents were due to petty jealousies or co-\nworker/supervisor incompetence. But when an individual is removed from a work site or\nfired four times in seven years, the credibility of such claims diminishes. Further,\nApplicant was over 34 years old when this misconduct began, hardly an age where the\nconduct might be attributed to youthful immaturity.\nIn addition to his adverse employment actions, the government also established\na case for disqualification under Guideline E, because of his falsifications on trust\nposition and clearance documents. He deliberately concealed his financial\ndelinquencies and his adverse employment from the government.  He did so knowing\n11\nthat these issues were of security concern to the government. His claim that he relied\non the advice of his FSO is not credible given that Applicant had previously completed\nsimilar documents and knew the requirement for full disclosure. Further, there is no\nevidence that Applicant revealed this adverse information before being confronted with\nit. Finally, he hindered his background investigation by failing to execute required\nreleases in a timely fashion.\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant did not disclose this adverse information\nuntil his subject interview.  Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose this information demonstrates\n12\na lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in\nexamining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant before\nmaking a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose\nthat adverse information in a timely fashion, not when they perceive disclosure to be\nprudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information\nabout himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security\nviolations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on\nto perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate\ngovernment interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\n\n7\nBeyond the specific guidelines alleged by the government, the generally\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions (whole person) lead to the same\nresult. Falsifications and finances are core security concerns [RAG &2(a)(1)]. His\nbehavior was deliberate and not due to circumstances beyond his control [RAG\n&2(a)(2); RAG &2(a)(5)]. His misconduct was both recent and frequent [RAG &2(a)(3)].\nApplicant is a mature adult and although his financial problems began when he was in\nhis twenties, those problems persist and his falsifications and employment issues\ncannot be excused by claims of youthful immaturity [RAG &2(a)(4).)]. Rehabilitation or\nbehavioral changes are difficult to measure under these circumstances [RAG & 2(a)(6)].\nHe clearly sought to mislead the government about his financial and employment\nrecords, or was at least willing to benefit from his misconduct [RAG &2(a)(7)].\nApplicant\u2019s willingness to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government\ninterests increases his potential vulnerability and he has not demonstrated that the\nmisconduct is unlikely to recur [RAG & 2(a)(8); RAG & 2(a)(9)]. The concern is whether\nApplicant would disclose situations or circumstances, whether deliberated or\ninadvertent, that raise security concerns and whether he will be able to exercise\nconsistent control over his finances. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial\ndoubt about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his falsifications\nand financial problems.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

GE 1, Tr. 30. He is a first-time applicant for a security \nclearance. Tr. 56. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1994. Tr. 99. He did not pursue \nhigher education.

GE 1 \u2013 5.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified eight separate line items, which included two \njudgments, four collection accounts, one charged off account, and one federal tax lien \nfor a total of $27,931 (excluding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.g.). Two of the debts are duplicates, \ni.e. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.g.; 1.b. and 1.c., thus reducing the number of valid debts from \neight to six. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.h.) \n \nApplicant provided the following explanation regarding the genesis of his \nfinancial problems and his solution for solving those problems: \n \nThe debts in this SOR were largely accumulated between 2000 and \n2003 when I was young, single and lacking steady, good-paying work. \nBetween 2003 and early 2006, I stabilized my professional career but my \nannual salary did not exceed $30,000 and I was unable to pay off the \ndebts. \n \nSince I joined my current company, [defense contractor], in October \n2006, I have further stabilized my professional, financial, and social life. I \nhave made steady progress at [defense contractor] and continue to play \na more integral role within the company. My annual salary has grown \nconsistent with the rise in my responsibilities, amounting to $57,000 in \n2007 and expected to rise considerably beyond that in 2008. Equally \nimportant, I currently live with my girlfriend of five (5) years, resulting in \nadditional savings by dividing up our living expenses. \n \nWhile I recognize that youthful ignorance is no excuse for my earlier \nfinancial miscues, I believe I have demonstrated that I left behind any \nvestiges of a financially-unsustainable lifestyle long ago. I have taken \ncontrol of all aspects of my life and have put myself on a steady footing \nto advance. In light of that, I believe any concerns surrounding my past \nfinancial issues have been more than sufficiently mitigated and that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States \nthat I be granted a security clearance. Response to SOR \n \nIn response to a question from his counsel about what he had learned with \nrespect to his finances, Applicant said: \n \nWell, I\u2019ve learned that it has a lot to do with my relationship. I never had \na situation where I saw I was interested in having things and I needed a \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfuture, thinking house, family, that sort of portion of life I\u2019d like to possibly \nbe able to live. \n \nAnd so, I\u2019ve learned that, you know, it was just being immature and not \ntaking responsibility for a lot of my actions.

Tr. 23-39. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \n\n \n5 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG 18, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \n\u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \n\n \n6 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant owed the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b61.a. \u2013 1.b., 1.d. \u2013 1.f., and 1.h. Applicant acknowledged he made poor financial \ndecisions earlier in his life, especially at a time when he was underemployed. Not \nearning enough money to meet his day-to-day bills, he fell into a trap many individuals \nhave and that is he lived off of or supplemented his income with credit cards. His lack \nof income also precluded him from paying his income taxes when due.  \n \nHis financial situation has substantially improved as a result of earning more \nincome, maturity, and the realization that his failure to handle his finances responsibly \nmay jeopardize his ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance. Since receiving \nhis SOR in April 2008, he has taken this process quite seriously and taken what \nappears to be all reasonable steps to correct his financial situation. He has settled \nand/or paid all debts alleged in the SOR except his federal tax debt. For that debt, he \nhas contacted the IRS, set up a monthly payment plan, and is current. His monthly \nbudget reflects a net remainder of $1,683 after his bills are paid. What is different now \nas opposed to before is he has the means, tools and resolve to achieve financial \nstability. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 19, two disqualifying conditions raise a security concern: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline F by showing Applicant \nowed the debts as alleged, except as noted, by the evidence presented. At the time \nthe SOR was issued in April 2008, Applicant owed six debts totaling $27,931. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, there are two potentially mitigating conditions: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nI am able to apply partial credit under \u00b6 20(b) because at the time Applicant \nincurred the debts, he was underemployed and experienced a business downturn, but \nquestion the level of responsibility Applicant exercised at the time. I am able to apply \nfull credit under \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. In short, Applicant has turned his \nfinancial situation around. He has established a viable budget, which shows a net \nremainder after he has paid his bills, and is able to save money. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.h.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nB. Daniel Lynch, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 24, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn November 25, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant appeal raises the following issues: whether Department Counsel met his burden\nof production; whether the Judge\u2019s questioning of Applicant at the hearing was appropriate; whether\nthe Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\nconclusions are sustainable in light of the record as a whole.  Finding harmful error the Board\nremands the case to the Hearing Office for a new hearing.\nWhether the record supports  the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  \nApplicant became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 2000.  He was employed as a linguist\nat a U.S. high security installation.  During this period, his employer gave him warnings three times.\nThe first was for attempting to sponsor an unauthorized person into the installation.  The second was\nfor accessing inappropriate web sites on his government computer and for over-reporting the hours\nthat he worked.  The third was for losing two security badges.  Applicant\u2019s job performance is above\naverage, as attested by performance appraisals, certificates of appreciation, and letters of\nrecommendation.  In the Analysis section of her decision, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s case\nraised security concerns under Guideline E and that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of\npersuasion as to mitigation.  She stated that Applicant\u2019s testimony concerning inappropriate web\nsites was neither candid nor forthcoming.  She further stated that Applicant\u2019s conduct, as reflected\nin the record, impugned his trustworthiness, judgement and reliability.\nDiscussion\nAs a threshold issue, Applicant notes the vigor and length with which the Administrative\nJudge questioned him, as well as her citation in the course of that questioning to matters outside the\nrecord.  A careful review of the transcript has the led the Board to conclude that it could cause a\nreasonable person to question the Judge\u2019s impartiality.  In light of that conclusion, we remand the\ncase to the Hearing Office to conduct a new hearing.  We recommend that the case be assigned to\na different Judge.  As a matter of judicial economy, we instruct the new Judge to treat all SOR\nallegations as controverted.  In light of the remand, it is premature to address any other issue at this\ntime.    \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REMANDED.\n\nThe SOR allegations under Guideline E are set forth as follows:\n1\na. You received a written warning on about [date] from your employer for attempting to sponsor\nunauthorized persons into [facility].\nb. You received a verbal warning on about [date] from your employer for accessing inappropriate\npornographic web sites on your government computer, and over reporting the hours you purportedly worked.\nc.

Moody              \nJames E. Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSeparate Opinion of Administrative Judge Jeffrey D. Billett, Dissenting, In Part\nI concur with my colleagues\u2019 assessment of the manner of the Administrative Judge\u2019s\nquestioning of Applicant and her citation to matters outside the record.  I also concur with their\ndecision to remand the case for a new hearing in front of a different administrative Judge.  However,\nI differ with the majority in terms of delineating the scope of the hearing upon remand.  On appeal,\nApplicant squarely raised the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence against Applicant regarding the\nthree allegations brought against him under Guideline E.   Applicant essentially argues that the\n1\ngovernment produced no evidence and failed to prove its case with respect to each of the three SOR\nallegations.  With the exception of evidence relating to the viewing of pornographic materials alleged\nunder subparagraph 1.b., I find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.\n\n4\nIt should be emphasized at the outset that there is an absolute dearth of evidence produced\nby the government in this case.  Other than Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony, we have nothing, other\nthan Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and his answers to a set of interrogatories, constituting the\nrecord in this case.  While Applicant admits to certain historical facts, those admissions fall short\nof establishing, on behalf of the government, a prima facie case of questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, unreliability, and\nuntrustworthiness under Guideline E\u2013again, with the exception of evidence pertaining to Applicant\u2019s\nviewing of pornography on his government computer.  The government\u2019s case is weakened by the\nfact that, notwithstanding the recitation of Applicant\u2019s receipt of written and verbal warnings or\ncounselings in the SOR, the government failed to produce evidence of either a documentary or a\ntestimonial nature regarding the content of those warnings or counselings, or the circumstances under\nwhich they were promulgated.  Absent such evidence, we are left solely with Applicant\u2019s version of\nevents from which we must determine (a) whether or not Applicant has admitted anything of security\nsignificance, and (b) if not, is his version of events plausible and thus worthy of belief.\nI agree with my colleagues\u2019 assessment that all the SOR allegations are controverted in this\ncase.  Therefore, the government was in no way relieved of its obligation to come forward with\nevidence.  Under our Directive, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\nto prove controverted allegations.  Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.  That burden has two components.  First,\nthe government must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR\nindeed took place.  Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the\nestablished facts and events and a legitimate security concern.  See, e.g., Gayer v. Schlesinger, 490\nF.2d 740, 750 (D.C. Cir. 1973); McKeand v. Laird, 490 F.2d 1262, 1263-64 (9  Cir. 1974)(holding\nth\nthat there must be a nexus or rational connection between a person\u2019s conduct or situation and a\ndecision to deny or revoke access to classified information). \nWhether there is sufficient record evidence to support the Judge\u2019s factual findings is a\nquestion of law, not one of fact.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0356 at p. 4 n.7 (App. Bd. Apr. 21,\n1998).  When a challenge to an administrative judge\u2019s rulings or conclusion raises a question of law,\nthe Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary.  See ISCR Case No. 87-2107 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992).\nThe Judge stated, in general terms, that Applicant\u2019s engaged in incidents of misconduct that\ndemonstrate a pattern of poor judgment.  She found that he did not follow the rules and regulations\nof his company.  With the exception of the viewing pornography allegation, there is no record\nevidence to support these findings.\nThe first SOR allegation (1.a) alleges that Applicant received a written warning from his\nemployer for attempting to sponsor unauthorized persons into the facility.  Whether or not the\nlanguage of the warning actually alleged an \u201cattempt\u201d cannot be known, since the document was not\nintroduced by the government.  Regardless of the content of the written warning, a more pertinent\ninquiry is whether Applicant, in fact, engaged in the underlying conduct supposedly alleged in the\nwarning.  Again, the only record evidence available are the statements and testimony of Applicant.\nAccording to the record evidence, Applicant had an idea about sponsoring someone to visit the\nfacility as a favor to a friend who worked for another contractor at the same facility.  From all\nappearances, the person to be sponsored met the qualifications for sponsorship.  Applicant merely\n\n5\nmade a proposal to his supervisor about the sponsorship.  The company objected, not for any\narticulated reasons relating to security but apparently because the sponsorship would have ultimately\nbenefitted an employee of a rival company.  Applicant states he took no further action as a result of\nhis company\u2019s rebuff and there is no evidence to refute him.  Applicant testified at the hearing that\nhe was mystified as to why the company issued a warning to him, stating, \u201cthey held me accountable\nfor asking the question.\u201d  There is no evidence of any company rule violations or disregard of any\ncompany policy on the part of Applicant.\nAs Applicant argues persuasively on appeal, there is evidence of an inquiry about sponsoring\nbut no evidence of any attempt to sponsor any other person.  One can only speculate as to why the\ncompany issued a warning under these circumstances, but in the absence of additional evidence, it\nis absolutely improper to assume misconduct or security significant conduct on the part of Applicant\non the strength of an unseen, undefined allegation.  It cannot seriously be argued that the mere\nmaking of an inquiry about sponsorship under the circumstances described by Applicant represents\nconduct indicative of lack of judgment or untrustworthiness, or constitutes misconduct.  I would rule\nthat the government has not established its case under SOR allegation 1.a.\nPart of the allegation under SOR subparagraph 1.b. involved Applicant\u2019s purported over\nreporting hours that he supposedly worked.  Applicant has categorically denied this allegation and\nthere is nothing in the record beyond his denials.  The Judge makes little mention of this specific\nallegation in her decision, other than to note that he received a verbal warning and counseling for it\nas stated in the SOR.  There is no record evidence that even begins to address this allegation.  I\nwould rule that the government has not established its case under this portion of SOR allegation 1.b..\nThe last SOR allegation (1.c.) States that Applicant received a written warning for losing two\nsecurity badges on one occasion.  Applicant admitted that he lost the badges.  However, there is no\nevidence that the mere losing of badges is a violation of his company\u2019s policies.  Indeed, it is hard\nto imagine how it could be.  Such items are often lost under the best of circumstances.  It is also hard\nto imagine how the Judge could characterize this as misconduct or a failure to follow rules.  There\nis no evidence of negligence on the part of Applicant, and the evidence that does exist indicates that\nApplicant acted prudently and responsibly in reporting the loss and getting the badges back.  If there\nwas evidence of negligent or repeated conduct on the part of Applicant related to losing badges, the\ncase might well be different, but neither of these factors are established by the record.  In their\nabsence, no reasonable argument can be made in support of the proposition there is a nexus between\nApplicant\u2019s losing the badges and legitimate government security concerns.  I would rule that the\ngovernment has not established its case under SOR allegation 1.c.     \n           \nAfter a careful assessment of the evidence in this case, one is left to ponder why Applicant\u2019s\ncompany took the actions that it did for Applicant\u2019s behavior other than the possible viewing of\npornography.  There is certainly no evidence to explain the propriety of the company issuing\nwarnings or counselings, given Applicant\u2019s explanations.  Those explanations are not inherently\nunbelievable.  There is also Applicant\u2019s uncontradicted assertion that the company\u2019s actions may\nhave been the product of a supervisor who was going after Applicant for personal reasons.  Again,\nApplicant\u2019s theory is not inherently implausible.  Such unfortunate scenarios do happen.  In a\n\n6\ncontroverted case, the government cannot satisfy its burden of production merely by establishing that\nthe government issued  the warnings or counselings without producing some evidence of the contents\nof those items, or the circumstances that led to their issuance. In the context of this case, I do not\naccept as adequate the bare proposition that Applicant must have done something of security\nsignificance, otherwise the company would not have taken the actions it did.    \n    \nMy colleagues have ordered that this case be reheard before a different administrative judge.\nThis essentially takes us back to square one.  The government has already had its opportunity to\npresent evidence regarding the sponsorship, the over-reporting of hours and the lost badges.  I am\nnot inclined to grant it another.  Even when the evidence of these matters is viewed in the aggregate\nand even when it is viewed in conjunction with the evidence involving the possible viewing of\npornography, the government has failed produce evidence of security significant conduct other than\nthe viewing of pornography.  Because there is some record evidence of Applicant misconduct\nregarding the viewing of pornographic materials, I am not advocating that the Judge\u2019s decision be\nreversed.\nI would remand the case to a different administrative judge with instructions to limit the\nscope of the rehearing to matters alleged in subparagraph 1.b. relating to the accessing of\npornographic materials on Applicant\u2019s government computer.   \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 29 years old and has attended junior college and received a Certification for Microsoft System Engineer. He is seeking employment by a defense contractor as a Linguist, and is applying for a Top security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of his questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR with some conditions. The Applicant\u2019s family came to the United States in November 1993. The Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen in March 2000. He speaks Arabic and Farsi. He was employed as a Linguist at GITMO from May 31, 2004 through April 17, 2006. During this period, he received three separate complaints for misconduct. (Government Exhibit 2). Applicant explained that there were two subcontractors that provided translation services.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 25, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on September 14, 2006.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On July 24, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline E for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 28, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.   This Administrative Judge was assigned the\nmatter on September 12, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 23, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for November 6, 2008.  The Government offered two exhibits\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted eight exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nNovember 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 29 years old and has attended junior college and received a\nCertification for Microsoft System Engineer.  He is seeking employment by a defense\ncontractor as a Linguist, and is applying for a Top security clearance in connection with\nhis employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because of his questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR with some\nconditions.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s family came to the United States in November 1993.  The\nApplicant became a naturalized United States citizen in March 2000.  He speaks Arabic\nand Farsi.  He was employed as a Linguist at GITMO from May 31, 2004 through April\n17, 2006.  During this period, he received three separate complaints for misconduct.\n(Government Exhibit 2).  \nApplicant explained that there were two subcontractors that provided translation\nservices.  An employee of another subcontractor wanted his brother to visit him at\nGITMO.  In order to have a visitor at GITMO, the visitor had to sponsored by an\nemployee which required a background investigation of the visitor.  The employee\u2019s\ncompany did not allow their employees to sponsor anyone, so the Applicant asked his\nsupervisor if he could sponsor the individual as a favor to the employee of the other\ncompany.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor told him that this was a conflict of interest between the\ntwo companies and was annoyed by the Applicant\u2019s request.  Applicant states that he\ndid not submit any documentation to sponsor the person, and does not understand why\nhis supervisor and project manager were so upset.  Applicant received a written warning\non or about February 16, 2006 from his employer for attempting to sponsor an\nunauthorized person into GITMO.  Applicant does not remember receiving a written\nwarning for this.  (Government Exhibit 2)    \nIn May 2004, the Applicant received a verbal warning and counseling from his\nemployer for accessing inappropriate pornographic web sites on his government\ncomputer and for over reporting the hours he purportedly worked.  The Applicant initially\ndenied ever accessing pornographic websites because it is known that they are\nblocked.  Applicant eventually admitted to viewing pornographic material by accessing\nseveral websites and receiving e-mail from someone that contained a power point\npornographic presentation of naked women.  (Government Exhibit 2).     \nThe Applicant testified that while delivering something to another location, he\napparently dropped his security badges (two security badges attached together) while\nexiting his vehicle.  Applicant filed a police report with the proper authorities regarding\nthis loss.  A soldier found the identification and returned them to the Applicant.  In\n\n3\nDecember 2004, the Applicant received a written warning from his employer for losing\nthe two security badges.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and Government Exhibit 2)\nApplicant believes that his supervisor and project manager are responsible for\nthese complaints and that they were not warranted.  He believes that they were\nthreatened by his linguistic abilities and they did not have the same capabilities.   (Tr. p\n43- 44).  He never received any complaints from the military, his customer.\n    \nLetters of recommendation submitted by high ranking military officers, co-workers\nand friends attest to the Applicant\u2019s talent, tireless work ethic, integrity, diligence and\nprofessionalism as a Linguist and his contributions to the national security.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits B, C, D, E, and F).  \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals for 2004 and 2005 reflect ratings of average\nand above average.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G). \nApplicant received three certificates of appreciation from the Joint Task Force\nGITMO reflect Applicant\u2019s meritorious service to the United States military mission.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n16.(d)(2) disruptive, violent or inappropriate behavior in the workplace;\n16.(d)(3)  pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\n\n4\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in rule violations that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in poor personal conduct (Guideline E).  The totality of this\nevidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline E of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that between May 2004 through February 2006, the\nApplicant engaged in three different incidents of misconduct that demonstrates a pattern\nof poor judgment under Guideline E, (Personal Conduct).  This pattern is fairly recent\nand very troubling.  Although he never received any complaints from the military\nconcerning his linguistic skills, he must still follow the rules and regulations required by\nhis company, which he did not do.  In addition, he was not entirely candid or\nforthcoming in admitting the misconduct regarding his pornographic viewing, and cannot\nbe considered honest or trustworthy.  Under Guideline E, Disqualifying Conditions\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:16(d)(2) disruptive, violent or inappropriate behavior in the workplace,\nand 16(d)(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations also apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable. Consequently, his poor judgment adversely effects his\nsecurity clearance eligibility.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 29 years old, but has\nconducted himself in a very immature and irresponsible manner.  Under the particular\n\n6\nfacts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed\nas a whole, support a whole person assessment of questionable judgement,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.     \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",
