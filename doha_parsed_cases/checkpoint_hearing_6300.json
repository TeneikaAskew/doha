Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 7, 2006. \nOn August 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug \nInvolvement) and E (Personal Conduct). (Item 1)  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 20, 2007.  He admitted the \nallegations under Guideline H.  He denied under Guideline E a deliberate intent to \ndeceive when answering a question on his security clearance application.  He elected to \nhave the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) \n \nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on November 20, \n2007.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on December 6, \n2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions within 30 days.  He has not \nresponded with additional information.  The case was assigned to me on January 28, \n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file and the pleadings, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nThere are six allegations in the SOR of drug use or possession alleged under \nGuideline H.  One of the allegations is based on Applicant\u2019s admission that he will \ncontinue to use marijuana in the future unless required to stop by his employer or to \nobtain a security clearance.  Allegation 2b under Guideline E (subparagraph 2.b) is \nbased on the same factual circumstances as listed in allegation 1.e under Guideline H.  \nThe government notes in the FORM that these acts raise security issues for Personal \nConduct under AG \u00b6 16(d)1.   \n \n \nThe essence of the security concern for Applicant is his use of marijuana.  His \nuse of an illegal drug both in the present and in the future is clearly covered under the \nsecurity concern and disqualifying conditions for Guideline H, Drug Involvement.  The \nplain language of the disqualifying condition cited by the government under Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) is for adverse information not explicitly covered under any other \nguidelines that may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination.  In this case, \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is explicitly covered under Guideline H, and is adequate for \nan adverse determination under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).  Accordingly, the \nsubparagraph 2.b allegation under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) is not appropriate, is \ndismissed, and will not be further considered. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under Guideline H.  He denied a \ndeliberate falsification on his security clearance application concerning his response to \never being charged or convicted of an offense involving illegal drugs.  I thoroughly and \ncarefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings.  I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old college graduate employed by a defense contractor as \nan associate engineer since May 2006.  He is not married.  While in college, Applicant \nwas employed by another defense contractor as a co-op student employee. (Item 3)  He \n                                                          \n1Credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not \nbe  sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information, including disruptive violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior in the workplace.\u201d \n \n\n \n3 \n \nis proud to use his expertise working for the defense contractor in support of national \nsecurity.  (Item 4, at 7) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he first used marijuana in 1993 when he was seventeen.  \nHe admitted to continually using marijuana at least once a month since 1993.  When \ninterviewed on December 1, 2006, he admitted his last use of marijuana was November \n24, 2006.  Applicant admitted to purchasing marijuana every two or three months for \npersonal use.  He denied ever selling or cultivating marijuana.  He denied using any \nother illegal or controlled substance. (Item 4 at 4)  Applicant stated \u201cI will stop using \nmarijuana at any time that I am required to by my employer or in order to obtain a \nsecurity clearance.  While I use marijuana socially and find it relaxing, it does not affect \neither my ability to perform in the workplace or to participate in society.\u201d (Item 4 at 7) \n \n \nApplicant admitted he was issued a ticket for possession of marijuana in July \n1997.  He pled no contest and was told if he had a clean record after one year, the \ncharge would not appear on his record.  He believed the charge was dismissed.  He \nadmitted he was charged with possession of marijuana in April 1998.  He was placed in \na diversion program and required to perform community service and attend Narcotics \nAnonymous.  He completed the required programs and to the best of his knowledge the \ncharge was expunged from his record. (Item 4 at 5)  He did not provide any documents \nshowing the offenses were dismissed or removed from his records. \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23d on his security clearance application \nasking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol \nor drugs.  Applicant admits to the two arrests and charges for possession of marijuana.  \nApplicant appeared in court after each offense and was placed in a type of diversion \nprogram for each offense.  He completed each program.  Applicant did not respond \n\u201cyes\u201d to the question because he thought he only had to list convictions and to the best \nof his knowledge he was never convicted of either offense. (Item 4, at 5)  He interpreted \nthe question as pertaining only to criminal convictions. (Item 2). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised Administrative Guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering \nsubstances, and include those listed on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  \nMarijuana is listed as a drug in the Controlled Substance Act of 1970.  Drug abuse is \nthe illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from \napproved medical direction. (AG \u00b6 24)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admission to using and purchasing marijuana from 1993 until \nNovember 2006 raises Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) \u00b6 25(a) (any \ndrug use), and DI DC \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution).   \n \n \nI have considered the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) and find \nnone apply.  Applicant\u2019s last admitted use was days before his most recent interview \nwhich makes his use recent and frequent, therefore (DI MC) \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \n\n \n5 \n \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  Applicant stated \nhe intends to use marijuana in the future unless requested to stop by his employer or to \nobtain a security clearance.  This clearly shows his intent to use in the future and is not \na demonstrated intent to stop using marijuana.  DI MC \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent \nnot to abuse drugs in the future, such as; (1) disassociation from drug-using associates \nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used: (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence: (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation) does not apply.  Applicant failed to \ndemonstrate that he has no desire to abuse drugs in the future.  He has not even \ndemonstrated that he may be on the road to such a position.  Applicant has established \nthat he is a drug user with no intent to stop using drugs.  Guideline H is decided against \nApplicant. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s failure to list the charges for \nmarijuana possession on his security clearance application raises security concerns \nunder Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate \nomission concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \nto determine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification.  He states he answered the questions \nbecause he thought the question only required a yes answer for criminal convictions.  \nWhile there is a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a \nmaterial fact in any written document or oral statement to the Government when \napplying for a security clearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement \nis not a falsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it \nis done knowingly and willfully.  The wording of the question is very plain that it pertains \nto both charges and convictions.  As an engineer and college graduate, Applicant can \neasily understand the extent of the question.  Applicant\u2019s understanding that the \nquestion pertained only to convictions is not credible.  The available information shows \nhis failure to list the drug charges was knowing and willful.  Applicant failed to establish \nhe did not deliberately provide false information on the security clearance application \nwith intent to deceive.  The false answer with intent to deceive is established.  I find \nagainst Applicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant has \nused drugs for at least thirteen years.  He intends to stop using drugs only if directed to \ndo so by his employer or for security clearance purposes. In addition, he was not \ncompletely truthful in providing information on the security clearance application \nconcerning drug related criminal charges.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s future abuse of drugs and his judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to follow rules and regulations.  He has not \nestablished that he is suitable for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his abuse of \nmarijuana.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nDismissed \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 11, 2007. Applicant filed a response\nto the FORM on November 13, 2008.  The case was assigned to me on December 8,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access\nto classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43 year old employee of a defense contractor who was born and\nraised in the United States.\nApplicant married a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in the PRC in\nDecember 2004. The spouse subsequently obtained an immigrant visa and permanent\nU.S. resident card and moved to the United States, although exactly when she moved\nhere is not clear from the record.

The sister-in-law\u2019s husband is employed by the PRC government.\nAccording to applicant, he and the husband have no contact. Applicant\u2019 wife has a close\nfriend who is a citizen and resident of the PRC. Applicant\u2019s wife talks to her parents and\nfriend through email and occasional phone calls.\nIn his response to the FORM, applicant stated he \u201cwas brought up in a family and\ncommunity that taught us to love our country and my allegiance to the USA has never\nswayed nor could it, regardless of familial ties or outside influence. In fact, my travels\noutside of this country only help to reinforce my beliefs that we live in the greatest\ncountry in the world and that our freedoms are worth protecting and safe-guarding at all\ncosts.\u201d\nThe Government provided six official United States publications with the FORM\nthat describe the economic, political and intelligence activities of the PRC. The\nGovernment requested that these documents be admitted into evidence. I have\nadmitted the documents into evidence, and I take administrative notice of the following\nfacts found therein:\nThe PRC, which has a population of over 1.3 billion people, is ruled by an\nauthoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The PRC\ncontinues to have a poor human rights record. Reported abuses have included arbitrary\nand lengthy incommunicado detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of\nprisoners.\nPRC authorities monitor telephone communications, facsimile transmissions,\nemail, text messaging, and Internet communications. \nThe Intelligence Threat Handbook identifies PRC intelligence activities toward\nthe United States as follows: \u201cThe United States is a primary intelligence target of China\n\n lnteragency OPSEC Support Staff, Intelligence Threat Handbook.\n1\n 2006 Report to Congress, U.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n2\n3\nbecause of the United States role as a global superpower; its substantial military,\npolitical, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim and Asia; its role as a developer of\nadvanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and the large number of\nAmericans of Chinese ancestry, who are considered prime intelligence targets by the\nPRC.\u201d  \n1\nOut of all the foreign intelligence agencies that continuously attempt to penetrate\nUnited States agencies, the PRC\u2019s is one of the most aggressive. Officials from United\nStates consider the PRC\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading threat\nto the security of United States technology.\nIn recent years the United States has convicted and sentenced a number of\nindividuals for espionage and illegally exporting critical technology to the PRC.2\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\n\n4\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.d, \u201csharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d\nmay be disqualifying. Lastly, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct, especially while traveling\noutside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or\ncoercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d may be disqualifying.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a PRC citizen. His parents-in-law, and sister-in-law and her\nhusband, (who is employed by the PRC government) are citizens and residents of the\nPRC. There is a presumption that an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to,\nimmediate family members. Applicant failed to rebut this presumption. These\nrelationships raise concerns under the first three disqualifying conditions. In addition,\napplicant has visited the PRC at least four times. Applicant\u2019s presence in the PRC made\nhim potentially vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by the PRC government.\nThese facts raise concerns under the fourth disqualifying condition.\n\n5\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s relationship\nwith his spouse and in-laws is one of obligation and affection, raising the concern that it\ncreates a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant failed to provide sufficient\ncredible evidence that it is unlikely he would placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of the PRC and the interests of the United States, or that he is not\nvulnerable to a conflict of interest.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant married a citizen of the PRC in the PRC in 2004. Although applicant\nhas stated his wife intends to become a United States citizen, at the present time she is\nstill a PRC citizen. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents and sister, as well as the sister\u2019s\nhusband (an employee of the PRC government), are citizens and residents of the PRC.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse communicates with them and friends through email and occasional\n\n6\nphone calls. These contacts, as well as applicant\u2019s four trips to the PRC, raise legitimate\nsecurity concerns. The targeting of United States citizens by PRC intelligence is not a\ntheoretical threat, as evidenced by the numerous prosecutions of United States citizens\nfor passing sensitive and classified information and technology to the PRC.\nApplicant may very well have been able to overcome the Government\u2019s evidence\nand establish that it is clearly consistent with the national interest for him to have a\nsecurity clearance if he had been able to clear up some basic matters, such as (1) has\nhis spouse actually applied for United States citizenship, and if so, what is the current\nstatus of her application, (2) what is the exact relationship he and his spouse have with\nher parents and sister, (3) has he or his wife traveled to the PRC since 2005, and (4) do\nthey intend to travel there. Unfortunately, by requesting a decision without a hearing,\nand then failing to offer documentary evidence that cleared up these and other issues, I\nhave no choice but to conclude applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s case under\nGuideline B.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 6,\n2005. On January 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 22, 2008. He requested\na hearing before an administrative judge. I received the case assignment on March 5,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 8, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on Tuesday May 6, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1-4, which\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and did not submit\nany exhibits at the hearing. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open until May 16,\nMay 21, 2008\n\nApplicant attached an addendum to his answer to the SOR in which he specifically addressed the allegation\n1\nin 2.b.\n2\n2008 for submission of documents. Applicant timely filed exhibits (AE) A and B.\nDepartment counsel had no objection to their admission into the record. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr) on May 15, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 22, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c of the SOR. He also admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a\nand 2.b of the SOR, but he denied that it was an intentional falsification.  He provided\n1\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1970. He attended college courses from 1971 until 1974. He also\nattended correspondence school until 1977. He completed a program and received a\ncertificate as a machinist. He was married and divorced three times. He has worked for\nhis current employer since July 2004 (GE 1).\nApplicant traveled extensively for his work throughout the years. He worked for\nvarious companies but was steadily employed. He relates that his travels contributed to\nhis marriage difficulties. Applicant has three biological children and six by marriage (Tr.\n16).\nIn 2000, Applicant was going through a divorce. His one son was involved in a\ngang. Applicant\u2019s former wife (mother of his son) called him one evening to tell him that\ntheir son was involved in an altercation. She reported to him that gun shots had been\nfired at the house and she feared for her son and his life (Tr. 19). Applicant quickly left\nhis home and sped to the house. He had been drinking at home prior to the time of the\ncall. He was stopped for speeding. Applicant recalls that there was an altercation\nbetween the police officer and himself. As a result, in November 2000, Applicant was\ncharged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI). He was found guilty (GE 2). He was\nfined approximately $1,100 and placed on probation for six months. He completed 50\nhours of community service (Tr. 33).\nWhen Applicant started working for his current employer, he told them about the\n2000 DUI incident. He also listed the incident on his 2005 security clearance application.\nIn 2002, Applicant was leaving his ex-wife\u2019s home where he had been making\nsome repairs. He stopped at a convenience store and bought two 24-ounce beers. He\ndrank one beer and opened the other (Tr. 23). He was stopped by the police after he\ndrove away. The officer had been sitting near the convenience store and saw Applicant\nleave. Applicant relates that this area is desolate and is considered a \u201cspeed trap.\u201d He\nwas charged with DUI. The court found him guilty on November 9, 2002.  He served\n\n3\nfour days in jail and was fined $2,100 (GE 2). He entered a program of deferred\nadjudication. He did not pay the entire amount of the fine but he was released. On July\n4, 2004, Applicant made a payment of $267 on the fine. In 2004, he reported that he\nwould pay the balance within three months. As of the hearing date, Applicant still owed\napproximately $750 on the fine.\nOn Applicant\u2019s January 6, 2005 security clearance application (SF 86), Applicant\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to a question about his police record. He listed a 1989 felony offense\n(possession of a firearm) and noted the record was sealed (GE 1). He also listed his\nDUI from 2000 and noted the records were sealed. He did not list his 2002 alcohol\nincident (GE 1).\nApplicant related the events of 2000 and 2002 during his security interview with\ninvestigators in 2006. He told them that the 2002 incident was a trumped up charge. He\nalso related that the state court informed him that this 2002 incident would not be listed\non his record. He told the investigators that he did not list the 2002 incident on his 2005\nSF 86 due to an oversight (GE 4).\nIn his 2007 interrogatories, Applicant revealed that the fine ($777) was not paid\nbecause he believed this was \u201chush\u201d money to \u201cseal the record\u201d so that it would not be\nknown to anyone. He intended to pay the rest of the fine but had some financial\ndifficulties due to his divorces and illness in his family (GE 3). He again stated that he\nwould pay the rest as soon as possible.\nAt the hearing, Applicant was adamant that he was not guilty of the 2002 charge.\nHe then stated at the hearing: \u201cso yes [I] falsified my information but it was under the\nintent \u2014 or not really, where it\u2019s when they tell you \u2013 they said well look, you\u2014 these\nthings are sealed.\u201d Applicant further explained that he did not think it was outright lying\nbecause he had been through the parish courts and they said do not worry about it.\nApplicant also made clear that on the application he knew it said \u201cwell tell everything\nthat happened.\u201d (Tr 25). \nWhen questioned, Applicant revealed that he has filled out a number of security\napplications since starting his current employment (Tr. 26). He has worked on sensitive\nmaterial and he states that he has never harmed anyone. He has not done anything on\nhis job that would be considered untrustworthy.\nOn cross-examination, Applicant admitted that he was angry about the amount of\nfine for the 2002 alcohol incident. He blamed the criminal justice system and felt that\nrace was an issue in the case. He stated that he would send them a payment whenever\nhe gets some money (Tr 34). However, he still believes he was \u201crobbed\u201d due to the\nlarge amount of the fine.\nApplicant admitted that he was under the impression that as long as he paid the\nfine under the deferred adjudication program, his records would be sealed. However, he\nstopped making the payments. \n\n4\nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR, he stated that when he initially\ncompleted the security clearance questionnaire he misunderstood the instructions to the\nquestion (Addendum to Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR 2008). He continued that \u201c [I] failed\nto read and understand that these charges should be reported even if the record was\nsealed.\u201d This does not make sense in light of the fact that in answer to other questions\nconcerning his police record, Applicant listed the offense and then put records \u201csealed.\u201d\n(Tr 38). He further argued that he just did not accept the fact that he did something\nwrong in 2002 (Tr.39). I find that Applicant falsified his security application in 2005 by\nintentionally omitting the 2002 DUI.\nApplicant explained that he had not paid more on the outstanding fine due to\nsome other financial problems. He had a knee injury and was receiving a reduced rate\nof income on workers\u2019 compensation in 2007. He also is paying for a daughter in college\nand some other family members who have needs (Tr 47).\nApplicant paid the remaining balance of $750 on his 2002 DUI in two payments\nof $375 by money order. He submitted evidence of two payments to the adjudication\nprogram after the hearing and before the record closed (AE A-B). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n5\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 31(a), an Asingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses@ may be potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 31(c), Aan allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted@ may raise security concerns. As noted above, Applicant admits he committed\na crime in 2000. He was charged and convicted of DUI in 2002. He also falsified his\nJanuary 6, 2005 security clearance application, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.\nThese facts are sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s DUI was in 2002. However, he had not paid the remainder of the\n\n6\nfine as late as the hearing date even though he was on notice that this was an issue for\nthe security clearance. The falsification is more recent (2005). It shows poor judgment\ngiven his record. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 30(d), it may be mitigating where Athere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d As noted above, Applicant\njust paid his outstanding fine from 2002. This is almost six years later. In fact, he does\nnot acknowledge the 2002 incident as his fault. This does not support rehabilitation. He\nprovided no additional information to consider for mitigation. I find this potentially\nmitigating condition is not a factor for consideration in this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16 (a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is a potential disqualifying condition. \n \nApplicant did not disclose his 2002 alcohol incident in his 2005 security clearance\napplication. Although he at first stated that he misunderstood the question, due to the\nfact that it was to be sealed, he listed other offenses that were sealed. Thus, his\nexplanation is not credible. He deliberately omitted the information on the 2002 incident.\nHe did not believe that he was guilty but he knew he was charged and convicted. He\nintentionally omitted the information. \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about\none\u2019s conduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing\u201d is applicable in this case.\nApplicant refused to acknowledge the 2002 incident. He also refused to pay the\nremaining fine. At the hearing, he was adamant that he believed he was robbed and\nthat he would pay sometime when he could. This outstanding balance was from 2002,\n\n7\nalmost six years ago. Moreover, the record was to be sealed if he paid the required fee.\nHe had not done so until after the hearing in May 2008. \nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Specifically, \u00b6\n17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgement\u201d does not apply in this case. Moreover, \u00b617(d) \u201cthe individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur\u201d does not apply. Applicant was unwilling to pay the fine for the 2002 DUI\nbecause he disagreed with the conviction. He has not had any other DUI incidents since\n2002. However, his refusal to pay the fine until after the hearing is not appropriate\nbehavior. He did not perform or comply with the rules and regulations and the\nagreement in his 2002 deferred adjudication program until faced with the issue of a\nsecurity clearance. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a hard-working man\nwho has provided for his family. He received two DUIs. He completed his probation and\ncommunity service for the alcohol incident in 2000. However, with respect to the one in\n2002, he disagreed with the conviction and refused to complete the program fine until\nafter his hearing. He still does not believe that he was guilty.  He was a mature man at\nthe time. His disregard for the rules does not show trustworthiness. His 2005\nfalsification is recent. Although he first stated that he misunderstood the question, when\nApplicant explained the matter at the hearing, his explanation was not credible. He\nlisted other incidents that had been sealed. Thus, his argument that it was sealed is not\npersuasive. Applicant did not comport with the agreement in the 2002 deferred\nadjudication. He has a good employment record but that alone is not sufficient to grant a\n\n8\nsecurity clearance and mitigate the concerns under the criminal conduct and personal\nconduct guidelines.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant was arrested for DUI\ntwice in 1978, once in 2003 and once in 2005 (the latter being the challenged finding on appeal).\nApplicant\u2019s drinking included periods where he would drink for days at a time and suffer blackouts.\nApplicant was treated for substance abuse in 2002 but continued to drink sometimes a 1.75 liter\nbottle in one sitting.  With respect to the  2005 DUI, Applicant was convicted, fined and had his\ndriver\u2019s licence revoked.  He was put on probation conditioned upon his participation in an intensive\noutpatient program, which he completed in 2005.  Applicant attended after-care through most of\n2006.  He continues to attend AA.  Three witnesses credit Applicant with two-and-a-half years\nsustained abstinence.\nAfter reviewing the record,  the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern under Guideline G are based upon substantial record evidence and are sustainable.

DOHA recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 16, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 5, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nApril 8, 2008. A hearing was held on April 8, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of eight exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on April 17, 2008.\nJune 30, 2008\n\n2\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\n       In advance of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to (a)\nadd the arrests covered by sub-paragraphs 1.b,1.c and 1.f to the arrests allegedly\nomitted by Applicant when responding to question 23d of his completed security\nclearance application (e-QIP) of July 2005 and (b) add the arrest covered by\nsubparagraph 1.f when responding to question 23f  of his completed security clearance\napplication (e-QIP) of July 2005.  For good cause shown, Department Counsel\u2019s\namendment request was accepted. \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of his treatment records and character references. For good\ncause shown, Applicant was granted 10 days to supplement the record. The\nGovernment was afforded two days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsupplemented the record with documented FAA medical certifications, 2005 outpatient\nsubstance abuse records, a continuing outpatient care status report, and character\nreferences.  His post-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered.  \nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel requested leave to furnish\ncopies of pertinent state statutes covering Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses.  For\ngood cause shown, Department Counsel was granted 10 days to supplement the record\nwith the state statutes.  Applicant was permitted two days to respond.  Within the time\npermitted, Department Counsel provided copies of pertinent state statutes.  These\nstatutory provisions were accepted for legal guidance purposes.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have (a) consumed alcohol, at times\nto excess and to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1975 to at least August\n2005, (b) been arrested, charged, or cited with four alcohol-related offenses between\nMarch 1978 and June 2005 (in March 1978 for driving under the influence (DuI), in\nDecember 1978 for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor, in February\n2003 for DuI, and in June 2005 for DuI), and (c) been treated as an inpatient for alcohol\ndependence at A facility in October 2002.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance\napplication (e-qip) of July 2005 by omitting his June 2005 DuI arrest when answering\nquestion 23c (any pending charges)..\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alcohol-related\nallegations but denied any intent to falsify his e-qip.  He added an explanation of his e-\nqip omission: reliance on advice of his attorney that (I) his June 2005 DuI arrest was not\na criminal offense and (ii) he was not criminally  charged. \nFindings of Fact\n        Applicant is a 48 year-old avionics engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\n\n3\nincorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol history\nApplicant is married and has two children (R.T., at 48).  He was introduced to\nalcohol in high school.  He began with beer at the age of 15 and expanded his alcohol\nof choice to mixed drinks.  He was a bartender for three years while in college and was\ngenerally around alcohol.  In the late 1980s he progressed to vodka and rum as his\ndrink of choice (sometimes chugging out of a bottle).  He consumed alcohol excessively\n(as much as a liter of rum or vodka a day when he was binging) between 1975 and\nAugust 2005, and often to the point of intoxication (see ex. 2).  He did most of his\ndrinking at home, but occasionally became intoxicated outside of the confines of his\nhome.  \nBeginning in March 1978, Applicant was involved in the first of what was to\ncomprise four alcohol-related incidents spanning March 1978 and June 2005.  He was\narrested in March 1978 and charged with DuI.  He was returning from a party for his\nhigh school baseball team when he was stopped by police and administered a sobriety\ntest at the scene (R.T., at 52-53).  He believed he registered a .12 percent BAC on the\nBreathalyzer administered him back at the police station (R.T., at 54).  He believed he\npaid a fine, but had no recall of ever appearing in court on DuI charges (R.T., at 54-57). \nIn December 1978, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle\nunder the influence of liquor.  He admits to being under the influence at the time he was\nstopped by police but did not think he was intoxicated.  He estimates he blew no more\nthan a .11 or .12 BAC on the Breathalyzer administered him by the arresting officer\n(R.T., at 58).  He believes this DuI arrest was disposed of by a fine without going to\ncourt (R.T., at 57).\n \nApplicant continued to drink heavily between 1978 and 2002. Sometimes he\nwould drink for days at a time and suffer blackouts (R.T., at 68-69).  Concerned about\nhis heavy drinking and how it was affecting his family, Applicant entered an inpatient\nsubstance abuse program with A facility in October 2002 (see ex. 2; R.T., at 69).  Once\nadmitted to A facility, he acknowledged being alcoholic and was diagnosed by Dr. X with\nalcohol dependence (ex. 2; R.T., at 72).  After spending three days in A facility\u2019s\ninpatient program, Applicant transferred to the facility\u2019s outpatient program for the\nremaining two and one-half weeks of his stay at the facility (see ex. 2).  While enrolled\nin A facility\u2019s program, he received prescribed anti-depressant medications and\nparticipated in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. His treatment counselors\nprescribed abstinence and continued AA meetings on his own after he completed his\noutpatient treatment (R.T., at 75).\nApplicant returned to drinking following completion of his A facility outpatient\nprogram.  He reached the point in late 2002 or early 2003 where he would consume a\n1.75 liter bottle in one sitting (see ex. 2; R.T., at 65, 80-81).  In February 2003, he was\narrested and charged with DuI.  He had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol\nearlier and registered a .25 per cent BAC when administered a Breathalyzer test by\narresting police at the scene (R.T., at 60).  He was convicted of DuI on these charges\n\n4\nand ordered to attend driving classes and complete 60 hours of community service\n(R.T., at 63). \nApplicant continued to drink notwithstanding his 2003 DuI arrest (R.T., at 66-69).\nHe recollects at least three to four relapses between 2002 and 2005, which included\nintoxication and blackouts (see exs. C and 2).  His drinking never resulted in any work-\nrelated alcohol incidents; albeit he estimates that there were probably a couple of times\nat work when he could not have passed a Breathalyzer test (R.T., at 143-44).  While he\nbriefly attended an alcohol outpatient program in 2004 (where he was once again\ndiagnosed alcohol dependent by a licensed counselor), he did not cease drinking (R.T.,\nat 86-87). \nIn June 2005, Applicant was arrested again for DuI.  He had taken off early from\nwork that day and consumed considerable amounts of alcohol at a friend\u2019s house in the\nmorning before driving home (R.T., at 61).  After striking a parked car on the side of the\nroad that housed two women occupants, he checked on their status, but does not know\nwhether either of the occupants were injured (ex. 2).  When police arrived at the scene,\nhe was arrested by the investigating police officer (see ex. 2; R.T., at 62).  He declined\na Breathalyzer at the scene (R.T.,at 61) and was later convicted of DuI, fined, and had\nhis driver\u2019s license revoked (see ex. 2; R.T., at 62-63).  As a condition of his probation,\nhe was court-required to attend an intensive outpatient course with B facility. He\ncommitted to an aftercare program sponsored by the same facility.  His aftercare\nprogram included sustained sobriety, positive lifestyle changes, knowledge gained from\nhis treatment, continued contact with the facility, and AA participation (ex. B).  Whether\nor not his probation was lifted by the court overseeing his aftercare program is unclear\nfrom the combined record.\nSince completing his outpatient course with B facility in August 2005, Applicant\nhas maintained his abstinence with the support of his AA chapter (weekly meetings) and\nan additional 62 sessions of aftercare through November 2006 with B facility (see ex.\nB).  Applicant\u2019s treatment counselor attested to Applicant\u2019s maintaining his sobriety\nthrough November 2006. \nApplicant continues to attend AA meetings and work the program\u2019s 12 steps\n(R.T., at 78, 90-93).  He has a sponsor and assures he has (a) maintained his sobriety\nsince August 2005 and (b) has no desire to return to drinking (see ex. D; R.T., at 76-77,\n94-96, 142).  Applicant documents receipt of a chip from AA that commemorates his\nsustained sobriety for two years (see ex. E; R.T., at 137).  In his discharge summary,\nhis outpatient counselor with B facility credited Applicant in February 2006 with\nsuccessful completion of a clinical intervention program in September 2005 that\nincluded his own self assessment of alcohol abuse and gained insight into the dangers\nof alcohol abuse and dependency (see ex. C).  His B facility treatment counselor (in\nNovember 2006) corroborated Applicant\u2019s AA support, acknowledged belief in a higher\npower, and commitment to future abstinence (see ex. C; R.T., at 94-96).  On the\nassumption that Applicant was able to maintain his behavioral changes and thinking\ntowards alcohol consumption, the treatment counselor assigned a good recovery\nprognosis back in November 2006 (see ex. C).  Whether his treatment counselors at B\nfacility ever changed their prognosis of Applicant is not known at this time.\n\n5\nInterested in returning to private flying, Applicant recently filed his application\npapers with the FAA (see ex. A; R.T., at 83).  Included in his post-hearing submission\npackage is his granted third-class airman medical certificate (see ex. A).  By its terms,\nthough, the medical certificate expires in May 2008.  Qualification for issuance of a\nmedical certificate for an additional year is dependent on Applicant\u2019s passing another\nphysical examination that covers his recovering alcohol dependence history (ex. A).\nApplicant\u2019s package of materials does not contain any required physical examination for\nhis extended airman medical certificate, or any updated alcohol prognosis (see ex. A).\nA January 2008 FAA letter in his post-hearing submission asks for additional\ninformation from Applicant: (1) details of his patterns of alcohol use, (2) medications he\nis taking, (3) confirmation of two years of abstinence and supporting letters from\nresponsible persons familiar with his progress, and (4) a current status report from his\ntreating physician that covers his history of alcohol dependence, medications, current\nfunctional/symptomatic state, and prognosis (supported by copies of liver enzymes or\nCBC testing from the last two years or new tests if none are available (see ex. B).\nApplicant does not provide any materials that address the expressed FAA concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, father, and AA sponsor all credit Applicant with sustained\nabstinence over the past two and a half years and a manifest strong commitment to\npursue an alcohol-free life (see ex. D).  Applicant, though, does not include an updated\nalcohol prognosis in his post-hearing submissions.  Lack of an updated prognosis\nmakes it difficult to evaluate his recovery progress and prospects for continued sobriety\nin the future.  Because he has had multiple relapses in the past, gauging his ability to\navoid a relapse in the future is even more difficult without current input from a medical\nprofessional or substance abuse counselor.  \nAs a recovering alcoholic, Applicant can not say he will never return to drinking.\nIn his AA meetings, he simply follows the established custom of one day at a time.  It is\nthe only way he knows of being honest with himself, and credits his sobriety with\ndramatic improvements in the quality of his life (R.T., at 93).  \nApplicant\u2019s e-qip omissions\nAsked to complete an e-qip in July 2005, Applicant omitted three of his four\nalcohol-related arrests (listing only his February 2003 arrest when responding to the\npertinent multi-parts of question 23 of the questionnaire). His explanations for his\nomissions are mixed.  He initially attributed his omission of his June 2005 arrest\ncovered by question 23c (pending charges) and 23f (arrests not covered in any of the\nother subparts) to his answering the questionnaire in June 2005 before the arrest\noccurred (R.T., at 96-97, 101-08). \nIn the approved amendment to the SOR, Applicant\u2019s omissions to questions 23d\nand 23f were added.  When answering question 23d, he listed only his 2003 DuI arrest,\nwhile omitting both his 2005 arrest and his earlier 1978 alcohol-related arrests.  He\nattributes \nthese \ncumulative \nomissions \nto \nboth \nhis \npreviously \ndescribed\nmisunderstanding of the nature of a DuI arrest (based on his lawyer\u2019s advice) and\nmemory lapses associated with his earlier arrests (R.T., at 103-05).  In other words,\nwhen answering 23d, he claims he simply never contemplated his perceived legal\ndistinctions in defining DuI offenses and criminal offenses.\n\n6\nOnly Applicant\u2019s omission of his June 2005 DuI arrest/charges in his responding\nto question 23c (pending charges) of his e-qip was alleged in the initial SOR.  When\nApplicant answered this initial SOR, he claimed he relied on the advice of his attorney\nwho assured him the 2005 DuI was not a criminal offense (see answer; R.T., at 109).\nWhen asked about this explanation by Department Counsel, Applicant confirmed the\nadvice he received and the reliance he placed on this advice (viz., that his June 2005\nDuI was not of a criminal nature) that prompted him to answer \u201cno\u201d to questions 23c and\n23(f) of his e-qip (R.T., at 111-34). This explanation is quite tenuous; since the state\u2019s\nlaw covering DuI offenses treats first time offenses as a class b misdemeanor and\nrepeated offenses as either aggravated or persistent, depending on the number of\nproven prior intoxication-related offenses (see \u00a7\u00a7 577.023(1) and (4) of the state\u2019s\nrevised statutes covering driving while intoxicated and other public safety offenses).\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for omitting his 2005 arrest when answering questions 23c, 23d\nand 23f are not reconcilable either with his memory lapse claims associated with his\nomissions of his earlier DuI arrests.\nWithout more to tie in his mixed omission explanations with his e-qip answers to\nquestions 23c, 23d and 23f covering his alcohol-related arrests, respectively,\nApplicant\u2019s explanations are not convincing.  The questions themselves (questions 23c,\n23d and 23f) are straight forward and ask for details covering any alcohol-related\narrests and/or arrests not previously addressed.  Acceptance of Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations require more corroborative proof of a consistently framed good-faith\nmisapprehension of the questions posed, the timing of his answer preparation, his\nrecollection efforts, and the reliance placed on his attorney\u2019s advice than Applicant was\nable to provide.  \nAfforded an opportunity to disclose his June 2005 DuI arrest in a subject OPM\ninterview conducted in January 2006, Applicant is on record in disclosing the arrest.\nWhat is not clear from the reported interview is whether Applicant was prompted or\nconfronted with the arrest before he disclosed it.  Neither the report itself nor Applicant\u2019s\nhearing testimony provide any clarification to this question.  Where doubts exist on a\npotential affirmative defense available to Applicant, they must be resolved against the\nparty who has the burden of proof.  Where an affirmative defense is involved (as it\nhere), the evidentiary burden rests with Applicant.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, common sense decision.\n\n7\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nAlcohol Consumption\n      \u201cThe Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 21).\nPersonal Conduct\n    \u201cThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 15).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated\nin the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As\nwith all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\n       Applicant comes to these proceedings with a good work record and a history of\nregular alcohol consumption over a 30-year period and four established alcohol-related\nincidents between 1978 and 2005.  Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related incidents,\n\n8\ntreatment, and multiple relapses following treatment for alcohol dependence in 2002\nand 2004,  reflects both a recent pattern of alcohol abuse outside the work place and a\npotential abuse or dependency problem that raise security concerns.  Additional security\nconcerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s omissions of most of his alcohol-related in his\nanswers to a security clearance application in July 2005.\nAlcohol issues\nOn the strength of the evidence presented, three of the available disqualifying\nconditions (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption are clearly\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s situation: DC 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d and 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly\nqualified professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol\nabuse or alcohol dependence.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s drinking history is considerable: It includes\nfour alcohol-related incidents, diagnosed alcohol dependence during inpatient and\noutpatient stays in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and multiple drinking relapses following\neach treatment episode.  His drinking history reflects problem drinking over a very long\nperiod of time, and warrants application of each of the cited disqualifying conditions. \nApplicant acknowledged, too, that he reported to work a couple of times during\nhis period of heavy drinking when he probably could not have passed a Breathalyzer\ntest.  While this is a potential source of security concern, there are reported no work-\nrelated incidents of record.  By itself, Applicant\u2019s  reported information is too attenuated\nand insufficiently developed to apply DC 22(b) of Guideline G (alcohol-related incidents\nat work) in these circumstances. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s A facility program had some positive influence initially on his\ndrinking practices, he soon resumed regular drinking and maintained this drinking\npattern for the most part until August 2005.   During this ensuing three-year stretch, he\nexperienced two additional alcohol-related arrests (i.e., in 2003 and 2005), for which he\nwas convicted, and at times consumed alcohol beyond recognized legal limits. This\ncombination of continuous abusive drinking over a extensive period of time (over 30\nyears) that manifested in a series of alcohol-related offenses (four proven ones\naltogether) and multiple relapses following his dependence diagnoses and completion of\ntreatment programs in 2002 and 2004 warrants application of DC 22(f), \u201crelapse after\ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram,\u201d as well.\nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he returned to outpatient treatment and AA participation\nfollowing his last DuI conviction in June 2005.  His sobriety efforts over the past two\nyears have been earnest and sustained and are underscored as important\nconsiderations in the favorable prognosis he received from his treatment counselor at\nhis B facility in November 2006.  While this prognosis reflects an important milestone for\nApplicant, it is still relatively dated, given Applicant\u2019s abuse history and number of\nrelapses following his 2002 diagnosis and treatment episode.  Without a probative\n\n9\nresponse to the FAA\u2019s January 2008 information request and/or an updated prognosis\nthat assesses Applicant\u2019s ongoing recovery efforts over the past two years, maximum\nweight cannot be accorded his 2006 prognosis.\nApplicant\u2019s efforts do enable him to claim the mitigation benefits of several of the\nmitigating conditions covered by Guideline G: MC 23a), \u201cso much time has passed, or\nthe behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome\nthis problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d\nApplicant may claim some mitigation benefit, too, from MC 23(d), \u201c the individual\nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with\nany required aftercare, his demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has\nreceived a favorable prognosis by duly qualified medical professional or a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d\nFor serious alcohol abuse cases like applicant\u2019s presents, MC 23(d) has the most\npotential benefit for resolving security risks associated with alcohol consumption.\nMaximum benefit of this mitigating condition, though, is not available to Applicant\nwithout a positive response to FAA\u2019s 2008 information request or a supplied updated\nprognosis to fully assess Applicant\u2019s recovery progress. \nWhole person assessment, while equally important to evaluating potential\nsecurity risks, is not sufficient in this case to fully absorb the Government\u2019s security\nconcerns associated with Applicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol-related offenses, alcohol\ndependence diagnoses, and recurrent drinking.  While Applicant\u2019s exhibited abstinence,\nstrong AA investment, and favorable 2006 prognosis from his outpatient care counselor\nare very encouraging, they are not enough at this time to mitigate the Government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  Without responsive FAA data or a positive updated prognosis, it is\nstill too soon to make safe predictive judgments that Applicant is unlikely to relapse\nagain in the foreseeable future. \nTaking into account Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, his dependence\ndiagnoses, his treatment relapses, and the abstinence progress he has demonstrated to\ndate with his continuing aftercare and AA support, the applicable guidelines, and a\nwhole person assessment of his most recent sobriety efforts, conclusions warrant that\nhis overall sobriety efforts to date, while encouraging, reflect insufficient current risk\nassessments by professional evaluators to absolve Applicant of continuing security risks\nassociated with his drinking history. \nConsidering the record as a whole, there is insufficient evidence to warrant safe\nassessments that he is no longer at risk of judgment impairment associated with his\npast alcohol-related conduct. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f of the SOR. \n\n10\nE-qip omission Issues\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list all of his of his alcohol-related arrests in his 2005 e-qip.  So\nmuch trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that the margins\nfor excusing candor lapses are necessarily narrow.\nBy omitting his 1978 and 2005 DuI arrests in his 2005 e-qip, Applicant concealed\nmaterially important background information needed by the government to properly\nprocess and evaluate his security updates.  His conflicting claims of memory lapse, pre-\ncompletion of the form before his June 2005 arrest and later reliance on his attorney\nthat his DuI arrests were not criminal arrests that required listing are too inconsistent to\nsatisfy necessary credibility requirements.  So, weighing all of the circumstances\nsurrounding his e-qip omissions, Applicant\u2019s claims lack the necessary probative\nshowing to avert drawn conclusions he deliberately withheld material background\ninformation about the extent of his arrest history.\nWhat is clear about the alcohol-related questions involved in Applicant\u2019s 2005 e-\nqip (both the ones covered by questions 23c and 23d and those catch-all arrests\ncovered by question 23f) is that they contain no time qualifications and involve alcohol-\nrelated offenses that are manifestly covered by the State\u2019s criminal laws.  Applicant\u2019s\nomissions require application of a disqualifying condition (DC) for personal conduct of\nthe Guidelines: 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, because his omissions are neither\nisolated nor followed by prompt and good faith corrections of his omissions.  Nor is it\nclear from his subject interview in January 2006 that he furnished information about his\nJune 2005 DuI arrest without prompting (see ex. 2).  Under these circumstances, he\ncannot claim the benefit of any of the potentially applicable mitigating conditions.  Not\nonly has the Appeal Board found the use of the predecessor to mitigating condition\n(MC) 17(c) (which is A5.1.3.2) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct (\u201cthe\noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) to be unavailable\nto applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as isolated, but it has denied\napplicants availability of MC 17(a) and its predecessor mitigating condition (\u201cthe\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts\u201d).  Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 1998) with\nDISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January1995).\n \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to sub-paras. 2.a through 2.c of Guideline E.\n\n11\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\n        In light  of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nGina L. Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 1997. In April 1998, she withdrew the\nbankruptcy filing, and resolved the debts on her own.  From 2001 to December 2006, Applicant\nencountered additional financial problems. She assumed responsibility for supporting her mother\nwho has serious health issues but no health insurance. During this period, she incurred 17 delinquent\ndebts with a total balance of $9,666, and her family home was foreclosed.  In December 2006, her\nmother qualified for disability and medicare insurance and no longer depends on Applicant for\nsupport. Applicant accepted a better paying job in another state and has systematically attempted to\nresolve her delinquent accounts. She mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial\nconsiderations. Applicant's eligibility for an assignment to a position of public trust is granted.\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and  Memorandum\n1\nfrom the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled \"Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases,\" dated November 19, 2004.\n Tr. at 6; Gov 1.\n2\n Tr. at 6-7. \n3\n Tr. at 24. \n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn February 21, 2006, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust. The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\"); and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines,\napproved December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006.  On April 9, 2007, DOHA issued\n1\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in\nessence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.\nIn a sworn statement dated May 8, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nelected to have her case decided on the administrative record. At some point, prior to June 21, 2007,\nshe verbally requested a hearing. Her request for a hearing was confirmed in writing on August 23,\n2007.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on June 21, 2007. The case was\ntransferred to me on August 2, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 30, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for September 18, 2007.  The hearing was held as scheduled. The government\noffered four exhibits which were admitted as Government (Gov) Exhibits 1- 4 without objection.\nApplicant offered 14 exhibits which was admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A - N without\nobjection.  The record was held open until October 2, 2007, to allow Applicant the opportunity to\nsubmit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted a 21 page document which was marked\nand admitted as AE O without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m,\n1.n, 1.o, and 1.r and admits to all the remaining SOR allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are\nincorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 31 year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who\nis seeking a position of public trust.  She is single and has a nine-year-old daughter.  She has never\n2\n3\nreceived child support from the father of her child.

She has been\nwith her current employer since February 2006 and is a referral management center liaison.5\nOn February 21, 2006, Applicant completed a public trust position application (SF 85-P).\nIn response to question \"19. Your Financial Record - Bankruptcy, Liens, Judgments. In the last 7\nyears have you, or a company over which you exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy, been\ndeclared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had a legal judgment rendered against you for a\ndebt?\" Applicant listed a home foreclosure in April 2005.  \n6\nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in December 1997.  She listed $750 in assets and $11,717 in liabilities. The bankruptcy\nwas dismissed in April 1998.   Applicant was encouraged to file for bankruptcy by her parents. At\n7\nthe time she was a single parent and they thought it would be best if she started fresh. She voluntarily\nwithdrew the bankruptcy in April 1998 after thinking about the repercussions of filing for\nbankruptcy. She paid most of the debts by contacting creditors and asking for settlements. None of\nthe debts are listed in the current Statement of Reasons.8\nApplicant encountered additional financial difficulties in 2001. Her father passed away\nunexpectedly on March 5, 2001. Her mother has several health issues to include end stage renal\ndisease, diabetes, and congestive heart failure.  She was unable to support and/or take care of herself.\n9\nApplicant supported her mother as well as her young daughter. Her mother had insurance coverage\nthrough COBRA for about a year after her father's death until Applicant could no longer afford the\npremium. Her mother became more ill and had a series of emergency room visits and\nhospitalizations as summarized in AE A. Applicant was employed full-time and spent a  large part\nof her income on medication costs for her mother as referenced in AE B as well as co-payments for\ndoctor visits and diagnostic procedures. Certain bills were neglected because Applicant's priorities\nwere her mother's health and supporting her daughter.   \n10\nA credit report dated February 12, 2007, revealed the following delinquent accounts: a $600\njudgment obtained in February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a $411 judgment obtained in December 2004\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c); a $2,214 judgment obtained in September 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $2,204 judgment\nobtained in January 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); five separate medical debts placed for collection, total balance\n$368 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a $370 check cashing account placed for collection in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); a\n$593 account placed for collection in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); a $503 cable company account placed\nfor collection in April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); a $741 utility bill placed for collection in May 2006 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.j); a $205 account placed for collection in May 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); a $575 account placed for\n\n Gov 2. \n11\n Tr. at 55-56; AE G; Answer to SOR. \n12\n Tr. at 26; AE K at 23. \n13\n AE L. \n14\n AE C. \n15\n AE D. \n16\n AE E. \n17\n Answer to SOR.    \n18\n Tr. at 35, 38-39.\n19\n Tr. at 52-53. \n20\n AE G at 2. \n21\n4\ncollection in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.l); a $40 account placed for collection in July 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.m);\na $46 account charged off in September 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.n); a $283 account charged off in August\n2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.o); a $610 account placed for collection in May 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.p); a $91 cell phone\naccount charged off in May 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.q); a $141 account placed for collection in December\n2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.r).   \n11\nIn May 2005, Applicant's home was foreclosed as a result of not being able to keep up with\nthe mortgage payments. She realized that she needed to find a job in an area where the cost of living\nwas lower and she could earn more money.  In December 2006, her mother was approved for\ndisability and Medicare insurance.   In February 2006, Applicant moved to another state to accept\n12\nthe position with her current employer.  Her previous job paid her an hourly wage of $14.57. Her\ncurrent salary is $21.75 an hour, approximately $42,328 a year.  Pay stubs from her previous\n13\nemployer indicate that her income increased when she accepted her new job.  \n14\nIn October 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator as part of her background\ninvestigation.  The investigator showed her a copy of her credit report which listed the delinquent\naccounts.  After the interview, Applicant obtained a copy of her credit report  and began to dispute\n15\nseveral of the accounts listed.   In April 2007, she enrolled in a debt consolidation program to repay\n16\nher debts.  The consolidation program is assisting her in determining whether several accounts that\n17\nshe disputes are valid. She is formally disputing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.q,\nand 1.r.  If the debts are valid, she will make arrangements to pay the debt.  The accounts alleged\n18\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d are paid.  The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, and 1.o were formally disputed and\n19\nwere taken off her credit report because they were concluded to be fraudulent accounts.  Although\n20\nApplicant included the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.p in her debt consolidation, it appears they\nmight be resolved. Significant payments were made to both creditors during the mortgage\nsettlement.21\nThe current status of the delinquent accounts are:\n\n5\nSOR\nParagraph\nDebt\nStatus\nRecord\n1.b\n$600 judgment related to a\ncheck.\nPaid.\nTr. at 35, AE F; AE O at\n2-4; Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3\nat 2; Gov 4 at 1-2.\n1.c\n$411judgment.\nDebt consolidation. \nTr. at 36; AE E at 3; AE\nO at 15; AE C at 2-3;\nGov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 2;\nGov 4 at 1.\n1.d\n$2,214 judgment.\nPaid.

She has not opened any new credit\ncard accounts. She recently had to purchase a car because her previous car broke down.  She\n26\npurchased a 1999 used car for $6,995. Her car payment is $300 a month.  \n27\nApplicant's friends and co-workers submitted character references attesting to her good\ncharacter and excellent work ethic.   Her performance evaluations are favorable.   Her most recent\n28\n29\nevaluation describes her as an excellent, crisp, communicator. She knows the technical aspects of\nher position very well and interacts effectively with others. Her position is critical to the company's\nsuccess.30\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n31\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines,\neffective September 1, 2006.  The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines sets forth personnel security\nguidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.\nThe adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.32\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n33\n Id.\n34\n Id.\n35\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n36\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n37\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n38\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n39\n8\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n33\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n34\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n35\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n36\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n37\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n38\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n39\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a)\n(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b619(c) (A history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply to Applicant's case. Applicant encountered financial problems around 1997 which resulted in\nher filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  She eventually withdrew from the bankruptcy and resolved the\n\n9\ndebts on her own.  In 2001, she encountered financial difficulties again after the unexpected death of\nher father resulting in her assuming the responsibility for supporting her mother. Her mother's health\nissues caused further expenses due to her lack of health insurance. Applicant incurred approximately\n17 delinquent accounts, an approximate total of $9,666. The family home was foreclosed in 2005 due\nto an inability to pay the mortgage.\nSeveral Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply.  Applicant\nhas a history of financial irresponsibility spanning several years. Although she has made progress, her\nfinancial situation is not completely resolved. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC \u00b6 20 (a) (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment).\nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\napplies with respect to Applicant's most recent financial problems beginning in 2001. In addition to\nbeing the sole provider for her young daughter, Applicant assumed responsibility for the care and\nsupport of her mother. Her mother has significant health issues and had no health insurance until 2006\nwhich was an additional financial burden on Applicant. It appears that the delinquent accounts related\nto daily living expenses as opposed to unnecessary luxury items. Once Applicant's mother was\napproved for disability, Applicant sought out a better paying job in a less expensive area. After she\nwas interviewed by the investigator during her background investigation, she took pro-active steps\nto resolve her accounts.  Several accounts were resolved.  She enrolled in a debt consolidation\nprogram and has made timely and consistent payments towards the program. She encountered\nfinancial problems due to conditions that were beyond her control. Once her mother received health\nand disability benefits, she was able to focus on the delinquent accounts and  has pro-actively\nattempted to resolve her delinquent accounts. She acted responsibly under the circumstances.   \n FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) applies.  Applicant\nreceived financial counseling in conjunction with her debt consolidation program. She has established\na budget and is able to meet her expenses. She is making timely payments towards her debt\nconsolidation program. She has a good understanding of her current financial situation and does not\nlive beyond her means. It appears that her financial situation is likely to be resolved in the near future.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies. In 1997, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy but later withdrew\nher petition and resolved her delinquent debts on her own.  Beginning in 2001, she struggled to\nsupport her ill mother and her young daughter.  Due to her mother's health costs, she was unable to\nresolve her accounts until 2006, when her mother qualified for disability.  When this occurred, she\nwas able to accept a better paying job in another state. She then took the initiative to resolve her\ndelinquent accounts.  Some accounts have been paid. Others are being paid in her debt consolidation\nprogram.  She is formally disputing other accounts but intends to pay them if they are established as\nvalid debts. She has demonstrated that she has made a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent\naccounts.\n\n10\nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concern. Guideline F is\ndecided for Applicant.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. In addition to Applicant's efforts made towards resolving her accounts, I considered\nher favorable performance reviews and reference letters from friends and co-workers. Based on the\nevidence in the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility\nfor assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

On February 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under\nGuideline J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as\namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005 and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on May 14, 2009.

Store security\nstopped them and called the police, who arrested and charged Applicant and her friend\nwith retail theft. At court, Applicant plead no contest to this charge and paid a fine.\nSubsequent to this incident, in 1998, Applicant sought medical help from a psychiatrist\nbecause of urges she felt. The psychiatrist diagnosed her with Obsessive-Compulsive\n\nApplicant met with this psychiatrist once in 1995.

The psychiatrist\n4\nprescribed medication.  \n5\nBy 2002, Applicant had discontinued her medication, as it was ineffective. In May\n2002, the police arrested and charged her with burglary and possession of burglary\ntools after store security reported her and a male friend for taking clothing from retail\nstores. Applicant acknowledged this arrest, but denied being charged with burglary. She\nbelieved the police charged her with retail theft, not burglary. However, the criminal\ncomplaint does not support her belief. Applicant retained counsel to represent her in\nthis matter. Her counsel and the prosecutor agreed that she would plead guilty to Petty\nLarceny, would complete a Petty Larceny course, would complete 50 hours of\ncommunity service, and would stay out of trouble for one year. Her attorney filed the\nplea agreement in court on July 31, 2002. Applicant complied with the terms of the\nagreement and the court closed the case on October 29, 2003.6\nApplicant worked in a local grocery store for 20 years, until it closed in 2003. Her\nsupervisor described her as a valued and trusted employee, to whom he entrusted\nhighly sensitive employee and business information. Applicant told him about her\nshoplifting charges when they occurred. He stated these incidents were out of character\nfor her. Despite these charges, he did not question her honesty. He described her as a\nvery kind, concerned and caring individual, who cares for elderly relatives.7\nIn 2004, Applicant worked one night a week in a shoe store. The store\nexperienced problems with theft of some jewelry items. The store accused Applicant of\ntheft, but never proceeded with criminal charges against her or sought to have her\narrested. Rather, her employment ended. Applicant denies that she stole any items\nfrom the store and the record lacks any clear evidence that she actually stole items\nfrom this store. Applicant acknowledged this accusation in her SF-85P, when she listed\nthis job and disclosed the theft allegation as the reason for her job termination.8\nIn 2006, Applicant again sought medical assistance. She met with her\npsychiatrist and raised the possibility that she suffered from Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Her psychiatrist referred her for an evaluation and\ntesting. The results suggested that Applicant met the criteria for ADHD. Her psychiatrist\nprescribed medication to manage her ADHD. Applicant takes her medication and is\ndoing well. Her psychiatrist indicated that the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder comes\n\nResponse to FORM; Item 11. Item 11 contains an authorization from Applicant to the security investigator\n9\nto ask her psychiatrist three questions. It is unclear from the document if the psychiatrist actually answered\nthe questions as only Applicant\u2019s signature is on the form. In addition, because the second question is not\nanswered, the answer to the third question about prognosis is confusing. Because the information in this\ndocument is unclear and confusing, I give it little weight. \nResponse to FORM.\n10\nId.\n11\n4\nand goes over her lifetime. Her psychiatrist also stated that as long as Applicant\ncontinues with her treatment her progress is good.9\n Applicant provided 12 statements from various individuals who have known her\nfor a long time. These individuals include her supervisor, a former supervisor, unit co-\nordinator, co-worker, daughter, and friends. Many are aware of her problems with theft\nin the past and know about her ADHD diagnosis. Some state that the theft conduct is\nout of character for her. She held positions of trust when employed by the grocery\nstore. All generally agreed that Applicant is trustworthy, reliable and dependable and\nrecommend her for a security clearance.10\nApplicant participates in community service activities. She pays her bills in a\ntimely manner and has an excellent credit score.11\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n12\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge;\nE3.1.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive; or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should not give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations.

Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency\u2019s rules and regulations is required. See\nUnited States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247-\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision.  \n12\n\n248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va. 2003)(explaining\nstandard of review).\n6\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nApplicant twice stole merchandise from local stores and twice plead guilty in\ncourt to this criminal conduct. In 2004, an employer accused her of stealing\nmerchandise from its store and ended her employment. These disqualifying conditions\napply.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n\n7\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nIn 2004, Applicant\u2019s employer accused her of theft, but did not file a criminal\ncomplaint or pursue the matter through the criminal courts. The employer\u2019s failure to\nactively pursue its accusation of retail theft raises questions about the legitimacy of its\naccusation, particularly in light of Applicant\u2019s strenuous denial that she stole anything. In\naddition, this accusation is contrary to the trust both her current and past employers\nhave in her. Throughout many years of working, Applicant has always acted in the best\ninterest of her employer. Except for one employer, all others gave her good evaluations\nfor honesty. I find that this accusation is insufficient to establish criminal conduct by\nApplicant. AG \u00b6 32(c) applies.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply to the remaining criminal conduct issues. Applicant\nhas two criminal convictions related to store theft and a third accusation of theft by a\nformer employer, raising the possibility of a pattern of conduct. Applicant\u2019s last store\ntheft and related criminal conviction occurred in 2002, seven years ago. Her only other\ntheft conviction occurred six years earlier in 1996. Applicant has established that at the\ntime she committed these thefts, she suffered from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,\nwhich was untreated. Her second incident occurred after she stopped her medication,\nwhich had not helped her condition. Since this time, she has been diagnosed with\nADHD and provided medication, which manages her condition. Through medical\nintervention, Applicant has controlled her urge to pilfer store items. \nShe works in the community and cares for three elderly relatives. She also cares\nfor her teenaged granddaughter when her daughter is deployed. She has an excellent\nemployment record and is well respected by her colleagues and customers. Her past\nemployer placed her in a position of trust, which she did not violate. Likewise, she did\nnot violate her daughter\u2019s trust in her to manage her finances and care for her child.\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about her past criminal\nconduct.   \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n8\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct\noccurred later in her life and resulted in two misdemeanor convictions. A false allegation\nof theft resulted in a job loss. After her first criminal conviction, Applicant sought a\npsychiatric consultation. As a result, the psychiatrist diagnosed major depression,\nrecurrent and obsessive compulsive disorder and provided medication. Applicant re-\noffended after stopping her medications. She again sought medical treatment in 2006.\nAfter testing and evaluation, the psychiatrist also diagnosed ADHD. She takes different\nmedication and complies with her medical treatment plan. Her prognosis for continued\nmedical improvement is good as she continues to manage her diagnosed conditions.\nApplicant cares for three elderly relatives in her home and has for some time.\nShe is highly respected at her place of work by her supervisors and co-workers. With\nthe exception of the one part-time job in 2004, Applicant has had a long, steady and\nsuccessful working career. She participates in community activities and maintains\nexcellent finances. She is a responsible individual as shown by all that she does. Her\nformer supervisor\u2019s statement that these theft incidents are out of character is\nsupported by all her actual lifestyle and the confidence of her supervisors in her. Her\nhonesty is also supported by her disclosure of the theft accusation. There is no paper\nrecord of the accusation and but for her honesty in acknowledging the accusation, the\ngovernment is not likely to have known about it. She has been straightforward about her\ncriminal past. There is very little likelihood that she can be pressured, coerced or\nexploited because of it.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her criminal\nconduct. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\n                                              \n                                                                 \nMARY E.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 31, 2007, and again on \nDecember 7, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case \nwas assigned to another Administrative Judge on January 17, 2008, and reassigned to \nme on February 4, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 28, 2008. I \nMarch 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on February 21, 2008. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 7, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf but did not submit any documentary \nevidence. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 3, 2008, to \nsubmit additional matters through Department Counsel. As of March 17, 2008, nothing \nhad been received. I asked Department Counsel to contact Applicant to see if anything \nwas sent. Applicant told him that she thought the record was left open until March 23, \n2008, and she mailed material on Saturday, March 15, 2008. I still had not received \nanything on March 26, 2008. I had a conference call with Applicant and Department \nCounsel on March 26, 2008. Applicant stated she mailed material on Saturday, March \n15, 2008. I told her that we never received the package and I asked her if she could fax \nus a copy of what she mailed. Applicant stated that she did not keep a copy. She stated \nthat she sent her annual Social Security statement and a letter from her company which \ncontained her security clearance status. I asked Applicant if she wanted me to continue \nto hold the record open for her to submit any additional material, but she declined the \noffer.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.f through 1.m, 1.o, 1.p and 1.w through 1.y of the SOR. She denied the remaining \nallegations.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is a high school \ngraduate. She is a widow; her husband passed away in 2001. She has three adult \nchildren.1  \n \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s husband passed away in 2001, he left her with numerous \ndebts. He had a retirement fund but she is unable to collect on it until she turns 65. His \nfuneral cost $25,000. She paid for the funeral by withdrawing money from her retirement \naccount, which triggered tax consequences. She incurred numerous medical debts \nrelated to her medical conditions. She had cancer and other illnesses. She admits she \nhas many unpaid medical debts. She is not totally ignoring her medical debts. She \nsubmitted copies of numerous checks to doctors and hospitals in her response to \nInterrogatories. She stated she pays her medical bills monthly as best she can. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g through 1.k are delinquent medical debts, including a judgment for $2,003, totaling \napproximately $2,856. These debts are listed as delinquent on the credit reports \nsubmitted as evidence. There is no evidence that they have been paid. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, \n1.w, 1.x, and 1.y are medical debts that are based upon medical bills submitted by \nApplicant with her response to Interrogatories.

Applicant does not have a firm grasp on what debts are owed. It is possible that \nat least part of these debts were paid by Applicant or covered by insurance.2   \n \n \nApplicant admitted to her debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1b, and 1.l list debts of $4,859, $4,186, and $2,065 to the IRS for tax years 1996, \n1998, and 2004. Applicant stated that she may never pay the IRS back because of a \nlarge tax debt incurred in about 1974, when the IRS refused to permit her to claim \nchildren that were living with her as dependents. She testified that the IRS states she \nowes about $26,000. Both credit reports show a federal lien filed in August 2000 for \n$11,406. Applicant testified that she sends the IRS $100 whenever she can and at the \nend of the year they keep her tax refund. She submitted IRS documents with her \nresponse to Interrogatories. A letter dated October 9, 2006, stated that the IRS applied \n$2,249 from her refund from tax year 2005, to her debt for tax year 1996, leaving a \nbalance of $4,859. A letter dated May 7, 2007, stated that the IRS applied $1,232 from \nher refund from tax year 2006 to her debt for tax year 1998, leaving a balance of \n$4,186. Another letter dated October 9, 2006, stated the IRS did not accept the figures \non her tax year 2004 return, and that she owed $2,065 for that tax year.3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1q, and 1.r list debts of $2,600, $1,084, and $4,029 to the same \ndepartment store. In her response to Interrogatories, Applicant stated these were not \nher accounts and she stated that her deceased husband had an account with this \ndepartment store. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1q and 1.r are listed on the credit report of \nAugust 17, 2006. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $2,600 is listed on the credit report of \nAugust 17, 2006, but it states the debt was transferred to another office and it does not \nlist a balance. The credit report of March 13, 2007 does not list any of the above debts.4  \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the debt of $147 to a collection company on behalf of an \nenergy utility, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. In her response to Interrogatories, Applicant \nstated she would pay this account because it may have been a bill for the month after \nshe moved. She indicated she would pay the debt on June 1, 2007. No evidence was \nsubmitted that the bill was paid.5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted she owed $2,635 to a collection company on behalf of a \nfinancial institution, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. She testified that she attempted to make \npayment arrangements with the company but they wanted the total amount due.6 \n \n \nApplicant disputed many of the debts listed on her credit report and on the SOR. \nThe credit report of August 17, 2006 lists Applicant\u2019s name, but it also lists another \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 25, 30, 42, 47-48, 51-52, 60-62; GE 2-4. \n \n3 Tr. at 37-41; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n4 Tr. at 26-30; GE 2-4. \n \n5 Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n6 Tr. at 18-19; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nname that Applicant states she has never used. It lists Applicant\u2019s social security \nnumber, but it also lists another social security number that is one digit off of \nApplicant\u2019s. It lists Applicant\u2019s current address and previous address in another state, \nbut it also lists an address in a state where Applicant has never lived. It lists Applicant\u2019s \ncorrect date of birth, but it also lists another birth date. It also lists that she was \nemployed for a company where she has never worked, in a state where she has never \nlived. The credit report of March 13, 2007 does not list the above inaccuracies. It also \ndoes not list the debts disputed by Applicant.7 After considering all the evidence, I find \nthat the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.t. 1.u, and 1.v were not incurred by Applicant.  \n \n \nApplicant has never received financial counseling. She wanted to file bankruptcy \nbut she did not have the money to pay the costs of the bankruptcy.8 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \ncertified as true on August 1, 2006. Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to Question 28a, which \nasked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d \nShe also answered \u201cYes\u201d to Question 28b, which asked, \u201cAre you currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d She listed a debt of $1,851 to a financial institution for \nan installment loan incurred in about March 1999. This is the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. \nShe did not list any additional delinquent debts.9  \n \nApplicant denied the two falsification allegations in the SOR.10 After considering \nall the evidence, including her demeanor and her inclusion of at least one delinquent \ndebt, I find Applicant did not intentionally falsify her Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 17-21, 25; GE 2-4. \n \n8 Tr. at 57. \n \n9 GE 1. \n \n10 Tr. at 65. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay her \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above potentially \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband passed away in 2001, leaving her with many debts. She \nincurred a large number of medical bills related to her cancer and other medical \nproblems. These are conditions that were largely beyond her control. She has not \nignored her medical bills; she has been paying them as best she can. As relates to her \nmedical debts, I find she is acting responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \nand 20(d) are applicable to her medical debts. She has not submitted enough \ninformation for a finding that she acted responsibly under the circumstances as it relates \nto her other debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable to her other debts.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. While Applicant appears to be \ntrying, it is obvious that she does not have a firm grasp on her finances. Her tax issues \nare many years old and are ongoing. Even her medical payments are haphazard and \nnot part of a well conceived plan. Without some kind of reasonable plan to address her \nfinances, I am unable to find that her problems are being resolved or are under control. \nHer financial issues are likely to recur and cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) are not applicable. \n \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.t. 1.u, and 1.v were not incurred by \nApplicant. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those debts. Applicant disputed the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1q, and 1.r. These debts were not listed on the most recent credit report. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is also applicable to those debts. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, including AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant omitted information from her Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions; however, it was not a deliberate omission. No Personal \nConduct disqualifying condition is raised by the evidence. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n8 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has had financial \nproblems for many years. Her tax problems go back at least to 1996. Her husband \npassed away in 2001, leaving her with many debts. She paid for his costly funeral by \nwithdrawing money from her retirement account. She has incurred many medical debts \nfrom her cancer and other illnesses. While sincere, Applicant never gave me reason to \nhave any confidence that she is in control of her finances. She does not seem to know \nexactly who she owes. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence of her financial \nproblems remains high.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.y: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSherry Perry, Personal Representative \n \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant emigrated from Kurdistan, Iraq to the United States in 1962 to \nattend school. He became a U.S. citizen in 1972. His wife is a resident alien of the \nUnited States, awaiting citizenship. They have five children, three of whom were \nborn in the United States. One of the children is a citizen resident of Canada. One of \nthe U.S. born children lives in the United Arab Emirates with her Iraqi husband. \nApplicant\u2019s brother and mother-in-law are citizen residents of Kurdistan, Iraq. \nApplicant worked in Iraq from 1976 until 1994 on a special project for the Iraqi \ngovernment and then worked in Jordan for a short time. In 1995, he returned home to \nthe United States. From 2003 to 2006, he worked in Iraq as a translator for the U.S. \nArmy. He has much stronger ties to the United States than to Iraq. He mitigated \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence. Clearance is granted. \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn February 25, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86).1 On June 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January \n2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns \nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer notarized on July 10, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing.4 On August 21, 2007, \nthe case was assigned to me. On August 24, 2007, DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing, scheduling the hearing for September 11, 2007. At the hearing, Department \nCounsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 into evidence. Applicant \nintroduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through M into evidence. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 20, 2007.   \n \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in GX 3.5 \nDepartment Counsel also provided supporting documents to show the basis for the \nfacts in GX 3.  (GX I to IV and VI to XI\u2014listed in GX 3).  \n \n                                                          \n1GX 1 (Electronic Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application).  \n \n2Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 22, 2007, is the source for the facts in the \nremainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n3On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a \nmemorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and \nother determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. Applicant\u2019s case is resolved under the revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines. \n \n4Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, notarized on July 10, 2007, received at DOHA on July 16, \n2007. \n \n5I marked the pleading \u201cAdministrative Notice\u201d as GX 3, post hearing for purposes of clarity.  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n3\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis \nfor administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well \nknown or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 \n(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). I took \nadministrative notice of various facts derived from GX 3 as indicated under \nsubheadings \u201cIraq\u201d and \u201cUnited Arab Emirates\u201d of this decision. \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nApplicant admitted the underlying facts in the SOR with clarifications of \ncertain facts.6 His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n   \nApplicant is 76 years old.7 He was born in Kurdistan, Iraq. He is a Kurd. (Tr. \n15). In 1952, the Iraqi government sent him to engineering school in England \nbecause he received the second highest grade in the Iraqi high school system. (Tr. \n16). He completed his studies in 1956 and returned to Iraq. (GX 2 at 4). In 1962, the \nIraqi government gave him a scholarship to attend an American University to further \nhis studies in high voltage engineering. (Tr. 30). Shortly after arriving in the United \nStates, he learned that he lost his funding and was notified that he should return to \nIraq. He subsequently met a U.S. Congressman, who found him a job and housing. \nHe remained in the United States and obtained a Bachelor of Science degree. He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1972. (GX 2 at 2). \n \nWhile attending school, Applicant volunteered to work with the U.S. Army \nROTC Counter-guerrilla Unit. From approximately 1963 until 1966, he instructed \nmembers of the ROTC in the area of unconventional warfare, mountain and desert \noperations. (AX G). His learned those military skills during the training he received \nas a young Kurdish man in Iraq. (Tr. 58).     \n \nIn 1976, Applicant returned to Iraq to work for the Iraqi government because \nhe could not obtain sufficient work in the United States in his specialty. (Tr. 17). In \nhis position as an electrical engineer, he was responsible for installing electricity \nthroughout Iraq. While there, he attended the University of Baghdad and obtained a \nmaster\u2019s degree and Ph. D. in electrical engineering. As he was no longer an Iraqi \ncitizen, he paid for his education and did not receive assistance from the Iraqi \n                                                          \n6GX 1, supra n. 4. \n \n7GX. 1, supra n. 1, is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated.  \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n4\ngovernment. (Tr. 31). He and his family returned to the United States many times \nover the course of those years, using his U.S. passport to travel. (Tr. 50). They lived \nin Iraq as U.S. citizens until 1994. (GX 2 at 4). He no longer has connections with \nany of the friends or people he knew during those years in Iraq. (GX 2 at 8). \n \nAfter completing the project for the Iraqi government, Applicant went to \nJordan for two years, where he became the managing director of an engineering \nbusiness, owned by a Jordanian, who was doing business with the United States. (Tr. \n34; 53). While there, he traveled back and forth between Jordan and the United \nStates because his family had returned to their home in the United States. (GX 2 at \n5). Since completing the work in Jordan in 1995, he has lived in the United States. \n(Tr. 18).  \n \nApplicant is married to an Iraqi citizen, who came to the United States in the \n1960\u2019s. (Tr. 27). She has been a resident alien of the United States since 1995, and \nawaits U.S. citizenship. (Tr. 19). They have five children. Two daughters were born \nin Iraq, and the other three children (two daughters and a son) were born in the \nUnited States. Of the two daughters born in Iraq, one is a naturalized citizen resident \nof Canada, and the other (his personal representative) is a naturalized U.S. citizen. \n(Tr. 19). One of the U.S. born daughters currently resides in the United Arab \nEmirates (UAE) with her Iraqi husband and family. She previously lived in Iraq for \nmany years, but left about two years ago because of the hostility towards American \ncitizens. (Tr. 46). The last time he saw her was in 2003 while working in Iraq. He \nspeaks to her about twice a month regarding family matters. (Tr. 28; 43). His U.S. \nborn son and one of his U.S. born daughters recently worked as civilian translators \nfor the U.S. Army in Iraq and have security clearances. (Tr. 67-68). \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, now deceased, were resident citizens of Iraq. They had \nfour sons and a daughter. One of his brothers and his sister are deceased. He does \nnot know the whereabouts of one brother. (Tr. 25). His other brother lives in Iraq \nand works as a teacher. He has monthly telephonic contact with him. (Tr. 24; 38). \nThe last time he saw his brother was in 2003 in Iraq, when he was working with the \nU.S. Army and the Colonel of his training unit requested Applicant contact him or \nother Kurds for assistance. (Tr. 24; 35). Prior to that time, he had not seen his \nbrother since 1995. (Tr. 36). He has strong ties to his brother. (Tr. 38).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is 90-years old. She is a citizen and resident of \nIraq, as are her four elderly siblings. His father-in-law was killed by Saddam \nHussein\u2019s regime. (Tr. 26).  All of these relatives live in the northern part of Iraq, \nthe Kurdish territory. (Tr. 55-56).  Although his wife has consistent contact with her \nrelatives, he does not. (Tr. 40-41). None of his relatives or his wife\u2019s relatives has \nbeen persecuted in Iraq since 2003. (Tr. 54-55). \n \nFrom August 1997 until March 2002, Applicant was retired. (GX 1 at 16; Tr. \n70). He then returned to work as an interpreter/translator for a federal contractor \nfrom March 2002 until June 2003, at which time he began a position with a federal \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n5\ncontractor that performed translation services for the U.S. Army. (GX 2 at 14). He \nsupported the U.S. forces in Iraq from approximately June 2003 to September 2004, \nand from October 2004 to February 2006. (GX 2 at 113-14; Tr. 20-21). He decided \nto work with the U. S. Armed Forces after 9/11 because of his loyalty to the United \nStates. He knew his language skills and cultural background would be valuable to \nthe U.S. troops. (Tr. 23; 70). He held an interim security clearance throughout that \ntime up to 2006. (Tr. 63).  He is currently unemployed, but would like to return to \nwork and use his translation skills with the U.S. Army.  He applied for a position \nwith a federal contractor, contingent upon his obtaining a security clearance. \n \nApplicant submitted two exhibits attesting to his capabilities and contribution \nto the U.S. Armed Forces\u2019 efforts in the war on terror. In June 2004, a retired \nColonel in the U.S. Army, who was the Director of Logistics for the New Iraqi Army \nTraining Team wrote that Applicant \u201chas demonstrated technical expertise in \nplatform translations and written translations. He has consistently exhibited personal \nflexibility, integrity, trustworthiness and a dedication to job accomplishment.\u201d  (AX \nC). In July 2006, a Lieutenant Colonel stated that Applicant has worked \u201cat very \nsenior levels of government and business in both the USA and Iraq that allows him \nto give a very valued and interesting perspective. We respect his opinion and input.\u201d \n(AX E).  \n \nApplicant does not own any property in Iraq nor in the United States, but does \nhave retirement funds in the United States. He belongs to a state engineering society. \n(Tr. 57). There is no derogatory information concerning his police or financial \nrecords. He has never been fired from a job. He has never been arrested. He has \nnever used illegal drugs, or been involved in an alcohol-related incident. (GX 1). \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship at his \nhearing and throughout his interview with a government investigator. The \ninvestigator noted Applicant\u2019s assertions of loyalty \u201cto the U.S. above all other \ncountries . . . and that none of his connections with Iraq and it\u2019s people, including \nhis family members, could ever be used to pressure or coerce him in any way.\u201d (AX \nI at 5). Applicant is a talented linguist, who fluently speaks Kurdish, Arabic, \nTurkish, Turkomani and English. He is also functional in French, German, Persian \nand Urdu. (GX 2 at 5). Currently, he is writing a Kurdish/Arabic/English dictionary. \n(Tr. 20). He is ready to use those talents to assist American troops and protect the \nUnited States. (Tr. 82). \n \nIraq  \n \nIn 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from \npower in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s new government took office. Despite the \nelections and new government, Iraq remains engulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al \nQaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have \ntargeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. \nDespite aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n6\nIraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as \nstate intelligence services.     \n \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) \n \n \nThe UAE is located in the Persian Gulf Region. The UAE\u2019s government is a \nfederation of emirates, each with its own ruler. The federal government is a \nconstitutional republic. The UAE and the United States have had a friendly \nrelationship since the formation of the UAE in 1971. The UAE and the United States \nwork closely together to combat terrorism. The UAE\u2019s respect for human rights is \nproblematic, due to lack of elections, arbitrary and incommunicado detention, lack \nof judicial independence, and restrictions on civil liberties.   \n \n \nPOLICIES \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge \nmust consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access \nto Classified Information\u201d (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for \neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions \n(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is \nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d \n \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, \nthe final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n7\nI have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d8 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to \nestablish a case. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [the applicant] has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 \n \nA person who is granted access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. \nThis relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty \nhours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals \nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Under Executive \nOrder 10865, \u00a7 7, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall \nbe a determination in terms of the national interest, and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n                                                          \n8 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from \nthe evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \nConsolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n9\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions \nof the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n8\n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s security concern about \u201cforeign contacts \nand interests,\u201d which may arise, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign \nfinancial interests, [he or she] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or \nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under [AG \n\u00b6 6] can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States \ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one \nrelative lives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). Applicant has frequent contacts with his brother, who is a resident and citizen \nof Kurdistan, Iraq, and his daughter, who is a resident of UAE. He has limited \ncontact with his elderly mother-in-law and family, who also live in the Kurdish area. \nThis close relationship with two family members, and a causal relationship with \nanother, creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause terrorists in the Middle East seek intelligence and are hostile to United \nStates\u2019 interests. His connections to his brother and daughter also create a potential \nconflict of interest because his relationship is sufficiently close to raise a security \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n9\nconcern about his desire to help them. All of these facts establish a disqualification \nunder Guideline \u00b6 7(a). In addition, his previous 18-year contract with the Iraqi \ngovernment and two-year project with a Jordanian company, after becoming a United \nStates citizen, trigger the application of Guideline \u00b6 7(b). Sharing living quarters \nwith his wife, an Iraqi citizen, who maintains close connections with her family in \nIraq, also raises a disqualification under Guideline \u00b6 7(d). \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence of mitigation. \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the U.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \nand, \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s relationships \nwith his brother and daughter are of sufficient magnitude to negate these two \nmitigating conditions. His contacts with family members in Iraq and UAE are \nrelatively frequent. Although he does not communicate with his in-laws, his \nwife does regularly. All of these contacts tend to negate the applicability of \nthe mitigating conditions. There is a remote possibility that terrorists could \nattempt to coerce or threaten Applicant through his daughter, brother or \nmother-in-law.   \n \nApplicant, however, did establish application of AG \u00b6 8(b). He provided \nevidence of his significant relationship and depth of loyalty to the U.S., such that he \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\u2019s interest. He \nlived in the United States from 1962 until 1976, and since 1995. While out of the \ncountry, he returned to the United States many times, using his U.S. passport. He has \nbeen a U.S. citizen since 1972.  He credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of being \na U.S. citizen and expressed great loyalty. He has a retirement account in the United \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n10\n                                                          \nStates. He belongs to a state engineering organization. His wife resides in the United \nStates and applied for citizenship several years ago. Three of their children were \nborn here. Another child became a naturalized citizen and resident of the United \nStates. In contrast, his Iraqi interests have become minimal over the years. He has no \nproperty in Iraq or UAE. He no longer has any Iraqi friends. He has three family \nmembers living overseas; however, he has spent minimal time physically with them \nin the last ten years. His contacts with the family members in Iraq and UAE are \nprimarily to discuss family issues.  \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \n\u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must not consider \nand weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, \nthe Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d10 The directive lists nine adjudicative \nprocess factors (APF), which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Because foreign \ninfluence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation \nand behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress,\u201d is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.11 \nIn addition to the eighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in \nreaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can \noverall common sense determination.\u201d       \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to \nthe U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties \nwithin the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance. Applicant is a mature person. He has lived in the United States \nfor 26 years, and he has been a naturalized citizen for 35 years. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nhas been living in the United States for approximately the same number of years, and \nis awaiting citizenship.

His ties to the United States are much stronger than his ties to his \nbrother or mother-in-law living in northern Iraq, and possibly his daughter. After \nbecoming a U.S. citizen in 1972, he obtained a U.S. passport and used it exclusively \nto travel between Iraq and the United States. While working in Iraq, he openly lived \nas a U.S. citizen. He came out of retirement at the age of 72, in order to assist the \nUnited States in its mission in Iraq, recognizing how vital his language skills and \ncultural experiences would be to the American troops. He contacted his brother \nwhile in Iraq, whom he had not seen for over ten years, for assistance per his \ncommander\u2019s request. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action that could \ncause potential harm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to the United States \nvery seriously, and he has worked diligently for a defense contractor for several \nyears in an important capacity for the U.S. Army. He held an interim security \nclearance throughout this service with no incidents of security concern. His \nsupervisors assess him as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, and responsible. He is an \nexcellent family member, employee, and U.S. citizen. After leaving Iraq and Jordan \nin 1995, he never returned, until he worked with the U.S. Army in 2003. Two of his \nchildren have also worked in Iraq, supporting the U.S. troops. No witnesses \nrecommended denial of his security clearance. There is not any derogatory \ninformation about him in the record.  \n \n \nFour circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  \nFirst, in Iraq there is a significant risk of terrorism, and there are human rights \nabuses in Iraq and UAE. Terrorists, and even friendly governments, may attempt to \nuse his brother, mother-in-law or daughter, who live in Iraq and/or UAE to obtain \nsuch information. Second, he had significant connections to Iraq before he \nimmigrated to the United States in 1962, and after becoming a U.S. citizen. He was \nborn in Iraq, and spent his formative years there. After becoming a U.S. citizen, he \nreturned there to work in a highly specialized area for almost 18 years. Third, his \nbrother and mother-in-law remain citizens of Iraq. His daughter, a U.S. citizen, lives \nin UAE. Fourth, he has frequent contact with his brother and daughter for whom he \nhas strong affection, which could create a potential risk of coercion, albeit slight \nbased on their geographical locations. \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . . \nit is deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in \nsecurity by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, \n1401 (9th Cir. 1990).  However, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, and all facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign \ninfluence.12 The evidence leaves me without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security \neligibility and suitability.   \n \n12 I conclude the whole person analysis weighs heavily towards approval of his security \nclearance. Assuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating condition \narticulated in AG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply, and after severing any consideration of AG \u00b6 8(b), I \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n12\nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d13 \nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the \nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nGuidelines. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n                      Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.h: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nDECISION \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on September 26, 2007. The SOR is\nequivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action.\nThe issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a\nhistory of financial problems as evidenced by delinquent debts.   \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n3\n Id. \n4\n2\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on October 3, 2007, and indicated he did not wish\nto have a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on the written record in\nlieu of a hearing. \nOn November 21, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of\nall relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called\nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant November 27  and it was\nth\nreceived by him December 5 . Applicant replied to the FORM with a one-page\nth\nresponse on December 27 . The case was assigned to me January 15, 2008. For the\nth\nreasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nProcedural Rulings\nIn its FORM, the government included as an item of documentary evidence a\nsubject interview of Applicant (Exhibit 7). The interview was part of a report of\ninvestigation (ROI) prepared by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The ROI\nindicates that the Applicant\u2019s subject interview was an unsworn declaration made in\nOctober 2006. \nThe general rule is that a background ROI may not be received and considered\nby an administrative judge.  The exception to the general rule is \u201c[a]n ROI may be\n3\nreceived with an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the\nFederal Rules of Evidence.\u201d  \n4\nIn past cases, the government has included an ROI in its FORM without an\nattempt to authenticate it or offer some other method of getting the evidence to the trier\nof fact (for example, stipulation). The ROI was excluded from consideration in those\ncases. Here, to its credit, the government properly authenticated the ROI through\nApplicant. In particular, in July 2007, it issued an interrogatory to Applicant asking if the\nROI accurately reflected the information he provided during the background interview in\nOctober 2006 (Exhibit 7). Applicant indicated it did. In response to additional questions,\nApplicant did not suggest any corrections or additional information to the ROI.\nAccordingly, without objections, the ROI is admitted and it will be considered. \n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges six delinquent debts ranging from $162 to\n$6,993 for nearly $20,000 in total. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the\nindebtedness except for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. Based on the record evidence\nas a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is seeking to\nobtain a security clearance from the Defense Department for the first time. He has\nnever married and his security-clearance application indicates he has no children\n(Exhibit 5). His educational background includes a high-school diploma and an\nassociate\u2019s degree in applied science (AAS) in electronics engineering. He was\nawarded the AAS from a technical institute in 2000.\nIn the background interview in October 2006, Applicant explained that his\nfinancial problems started when he fell behind paying bills sometime after January 2002\n(Exhibit 7). This happened because he was laid off from his job with another employer\nand had difficulty finding another job. He found another job several months later in July\n2002. He did not seek unemployment benefits during this period. He indicated that he\nhad yet to financially recover from this event.  \nApplicant provided additional information when he replied to the FORM. He\nacknowledged that his past financial decisions were less than responsible when he\nstated the following:\nI realize that my past decisions regarding financial matters have not been\nwise. I know that I need to take responsibility for my lack of action and\nintend to do so. I have begun to make payments on some of my accounts\nand I will be using my income tax return to assist. I understand why my\nrequest for clearance is being scrutinized in this way but I can assure you\nmy debts never have been nor will be satisfied by any illegal or immoral\nactions. I hope that you will take this letter into consideration on my behalf\n(Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM).\nThe status of his indebtedness, as alleged in the SOR, is summarized in the\nfollowing table. \nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013collection account for $3,280. \nUnpaid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013collection account for $162. \nPaid. Has current account with same cell\nphone company (Exhibits 6 and 7).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013collection account for $1,817.\nLawsuit to collect this debt resolved in\nDec. 2006 when the case was nonsuited\n(Exhibits 6 and 11). \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n5\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n8\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n9\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013delinquent account for\n$1,232. \nUnpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013delinquent account for\n$6,227.\nUnpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013charged-off account for\n$6,993. \nUnpaid. \nTo sum up, four debts remain outstanding for about $17,732 in total. \nSince the SOR was issued, Applicant has had a judgment entered against him in\nOctober 2007 for $2,784, and there is no indication that it has been satisfied or\notherwise resolved (Exhibit 12). It appears the judgment stems from the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.a. In addition to the judgment, in November 2007, another creditor brought a lawsuit\nfor collection of a debt (Exhibit 13). A hearing was scheduled to take place in December\n2007. The result of that lawsuit is unknown. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.5\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n6\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any\n7\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n8\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n9\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n13\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n14\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n15\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n16\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n17\n5\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n10\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n11\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n12\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.13\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.14\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n15\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n16\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n17\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n18\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n19\n MC 2 is \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g.,\n20\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\n MC 4 is \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n21\n6\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n18\n19\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions, which raise a security concern. The same\nfacts and circumstances support a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. \nThe mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and two\ndeserve discussion. The most pertinent is MC 2, which takes into account conditions\nbeyond a person\u2019s control provided they acted reasonably under the circumstances.20\nNo doubt, Applicant\u2019s period of unemployment in 2002 caused him to experience\nfinancial problems. But at this point, Applicant can no longer use that event as an\nexcuse approximately five years later. Accordingly, MC 2 does not apply in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor. \nThe other pertinent mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to\ninitiate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.21\nApplicant has resolved two of the six debts alleged in the SOR, one by payment and the\nother when the collection lawsuit was nonsuited. Four debts, which account for the vast\nmajority of the delinquent debt, are outstanding. Moreover, he has done little to resolve\nthose four debts. Given these circumstances, MC 4 does not apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAlthough Applicant is relatively youthful at 27, he is old enough to make prudent\ndecisions about his finances. His intent to resolve his financial problems appears to be\ngenuine; however, he has done little so far to demonstrate his intent. What is missing\nhere is (1) a realistic and workable plan to clean up his financial house, (2) documented\nactions taken in furtherance of the plan, and (3) a measurable improvement to the\nsituation. Given the current circumstances, it is likely that the financial problems will\ncontinue or recur. This is especially so considering the recent collection lawsuits taken\nagainst Applicant in late 2007.   \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet his\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis\ndoes not support a favorable decision.\n\n7\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet his\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, & 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b & 1.c:\nFor Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On May 25, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 3, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a\ntimely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nApplicant had knowingly falsified his security clearance application (SCA); and  whether the Judge\nerred in not favorably applying Guideline E mitigating conditions.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings: Applicant was arrested in May 2001, as\nhe was finishing college, for possession and distribution of 100 ecstasy pills.  Pleading guilty,\nApplicant was sentenced to five years probation, a suspended driver\u2019s license, a fine of $3,205.00,\nand 200 hours of community service.  He completed his sentence in 2003 and was released from\nprobation two years early.\nIn 2003 Applicant was arrested for receiving stolen property, having been stopped by the\npolice for riding in a stolen car driven by a friend.  The charge was subsequently dismissed as\nApplicant had not known that the car was stolen.  On February 2, 2006,  when completing his SCA,\n2\nApplicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to a question concerning his having been arrested, charged, or convicted\nwithin the seven years prior.  He listed the 2001 arrest and conviction but did not mention the 2003\narrest.  The Judge noted that, on the SCA, Applicant stated that \u201cthere is no record of trouble\u201d since\nthe 2001 incident.  Decision at 4.\nThe Judge concluded that, in not mentioning the 2003 arrest, Applicant had knowingly\nomitted information that he was legally required to disclose.  He stated, in the Conclusions section\nof his decision, the Applicant \u201cprovided inconsistent explanations for his omission of the 2003 arrest\n. . .  At his hearing he claimed he was so focused on the details of the 2001 arrest he forgot about the\n2003 arrest.  Yet, in providing details about the 2001 arrest . . . he affirmatively stated he had not\nbeen involved since 2001 in any other adverse criminal conduct.\u201d  Decision at 6.  \nThe Judge noted that Applicant did not disclose the second incident until confronted with it\nduring the investigative interview, which precluded a conclusion that he had made a prompt, good-\nfaith effort to correct the omission.  The Board also notes record evidence that Applicant was an\nhonors graduate of a well-known university, thereby evidencing a level of  sophistication consistent\n\n3\nwith the Judge\u2019s view that Applicant intended the plain meaning of his words.  The Board also notes\nthat Applicant\u2019s appeal brief attributes his omission to the haste in which he filled out the SCA,\nwhich appears inconsistent with his testimony that he was simply too focused on the first event to\nrecall the second.  \nViewed in the light of the record as a whole, the Judge has articulated \u201ca satisfactory\nexplanation for [his] conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\u201d and his\nadverse decision, both as to the intentional nature of Applicant\u2019s omission as well as the application\nof Guideline E mitigating conditions.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\nThe record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion that\nit is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u201d for him to have a clearance.  See\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Jean E.

MALONE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nLenore M. Imhof, Esquire\nSYNOPSIS\nSecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s arrests in 2001 and 2003 are mitigated. However,\nhe  was unable to mitigate the security concern about his deliberate omission of information about\nhis arrests from a security clearance application he submitted in January 2006. Clearance is denied.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n This matter was originally set for hearing on October 11, but was continued three times due to a change in\n3\nvenue and schedule conflicts before and after Applicant retained legal counsel. \n Gx. 1; Tr., 49.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nAfter reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s most recent background investigation, adjudicators\nfor the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security\n1\nclearance. On May 25, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging\nfacts that raise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines under Guideline\nF (financial considerations).2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing. However,\nthe government timely requested a hearing and the case was assigned to a DOHA administrative\njudge on September 10, 2007, but transferred to me on September 24, 2007, due to workload\nconsiderations. I convened a hearing on November 6, 2007, at which the parties appeared as\nscheduled.  I admitted five exhibits proffered by the government (Gx. 1- 5). Applicant testified and\n3\noffered seven exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - G.\nI also left the record open to receive additional information from Applicant. On November 11, 2007,\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.). The record closed on November 30, 2007, when I received\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions, which are included in the record as Ax. H and I.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was arrested for and convicted of possession\nof a controlled dangerous substance in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that he was arrested in August 2003\nand charged with receiving stolen property, a charge that was later dismissed (SOR \u00b6 1.b).

Since receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree (with honors) in computer\nscience in 2001, he has worked as a computer programmer. In 2003, he was hired by a company that\nprovides systems development, testing, and installation services for private industry clients and to\nDepartment of Defense customers.

On January 25, 2002, he pleaded guilty\nto possession of a controlled dangerous substance, for which he was placed on probation for five\nyears, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months, he was assessed a $3,205 fine, and he was\nordered to perform 200 hours of community service. His guilty plea was entered in exchange for the\ndismissal of an additional charge of distribution of heroin or cocaine.  Applicant completed all of\n5\nthe terms of his sentence in 2003 and testified he was released from his probation two years early.6\nIn August 2003, Applicant was riding with two friends in a car driven by one of the friends.\nWhen the police attempted to pull the car over for speeding, the driver initially sped up and refused\nto stop. When he did stop, the police arrested the occupants of the vehicle because the car was stolen.\nThey were handcuffed, taken to the police station, and held for overnight. Applicant was released\nwithout bond. He subsequently received a letter in the mail advising him he had been charged with\nreceiving stolen property and ordering him to appear in court on December 8, 2003. He appeared as\nordered and was told the charges against him were dismissed. The driver of the car had given a\nwritten statement stating, inter alia, that Applicant did not know the car was stolen.7\nOn February 2, 2006, Applicant completed and electronically submitted an e-QIP. In response\nto question 23.f (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any\noffense(s) not listed in response to [23]a, b, c, d, or e above?\u201d), he answered \u201cyes\u201d and listed his May\n2001 drug arrest. He did not list his August 2003 arrest.\nIn July 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator regarding the August\n2003 arrest, which Applicant did not disclose on his e-QIP.  In the interview, Applicant did not\n8\ndisclose this arrest until the investigating agent asked him about it.  In October 2006, the agent again\n9\ninterviewed Applicant regarding adverse information about his finances, some of which Applicant\ndid not disclose on his e-QIP.10\nIn response to SOR \u00b6 2.a, which alleged Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his 2003\narrest on his e-QIP, Applicant averred he \u201cdid not remember [the arrest] since [he] never had to make\na court appearance and the charge was dropped that it had even happened (sic) or I would have listed\nit as I did the more serious [May 2001] charge.\u201d  Applicant testified he was aware that disclosure\n11\n\n Tr., 62 - 63.\n12\n Tr., 67 - 68, 87 - 88.\n13\n Gx. 1, at page 28 of 32.\n14\n Tr., 79 - 80, 104.\n15\n Ax. A; Ax. B.\n16\n Directive, 6.3.\n17\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness\n18\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\n4\nof his May 2001 arrest could disqualify him from receiving his clearance.  He explained his\n12\nomission of the 2003 arrest happened because he was focusing on the details of the 2001 arrest, and\nthat he forgot about the arrest.  In addition to providing details about the disposition of the 2001\n13\ncharges, Applicant stated \u201cthere is no record of trouble since then. Probation was completed 100%\nsatisfactory (sic). All urine tests were clean, All (sic) fines were paid, All (sic) community service\nwas completed.\u201d14\n        \nWhen Applicant was arrested in May 2001, he was handcuffed, taken to a police station,\nfingerprinted, and photographed. He was released the following day. When he was arrested in\nAugust 2003, he was arrested, taken to a police station, and released the next day. He told the\ngovernment investigator in July 2006 that he had received a summons and knew before he appeared\nin court that he had been charged with a crime. However, at hearing he testified that he was not\naware he was charged with anything until he appeared in court.15\nApplicant no longer associates with any of the people with whom he was involved during\nboth of his arrests. He has established himself as a valuable employee and has been given increased\nresponsibilities for new work in various locations around the country and abroad. He recently bought\nhis own home as well as the house his grandmother owned until her death in 2006. The executive\nvice president of his company and a former high school teacher regard Applicant as hard working,\nreliable, and honest, although neither referenced any knowledge about the SOR allegations of\nfalsification or criminal conduct.16\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination\nbased on examination of all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.  Decisions must\n17\nalso reflect consideration of the factors listed in the \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or\n18\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n19\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n20\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n21\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 30.\n22\n \u201c a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d\n23\n \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\n24\nprosecuted or convicted;\u201d\n5\nan applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to\nclassified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties at\nhearing require that Revised Adjudicative Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal\nconduct) be applied.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n19\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n20\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.21\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal Conduct. Under Guideline J, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  The government presented sufficient\n22\ninformation to support the allegations that Applicant was arrested and convicted of a 2001 drug\noffense as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Available information further supports the allegation that he was\nalso arrested in 2003 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The record requires consideration Guideline J\ndisqualifying condition (DC) 31(a)  and DC 31(c).  However, as to SOR \u00b6 1.b, available\n23\n24\ninformation shows that Applicant did not engage in criminal conduct on that occasion. Nonetheless,\nhis conduct that resulted in his May 2001 arrest and conviction is sufficient to disqualify him from\nholding a clearance.\n\n \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n25\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n26\n \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\n27\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\u201d\n \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\n28\nbeing confronted with the facts;\u201d\n \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by\n29\nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically\nconcerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the\ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully;\u201d\n6\nBy contrast, the record also requires consideration of Guideline J mitigating conditions\n32(a).  The offense occurred more than six years ago when Applicant was still in college. He\n25\nadhered to the terms of his sentence and has been off probation for at least two years. His personal\ncircumstances have changed for the better as he has been working in his field of expertise the past\nsix years and no longer associates with the persons with whom he engaged in the criminal conduct.\nAvailable information suggests he is unlikely to repeat his involvement in the illegal drug trade.\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns about his criminal conduct.\nPersonal Conduct. Under Guideline E, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Available\n26\ninformation is sufficient to support the government\u2019s allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.a) that Applicant\u2019s\nomission of his 2003 arrest was deliberate. Despite his denial that he did not intentionally falsify his\nanswer to e-QIP question 23.f, the totality of the information probative of this issue supports the\ngovernment\u2019s allegation. Applicant was aware of the potentially negative impact disclosure of his\narrests might have on his suitability for a security clearance. To his credit he disclosed his 2001\narrest and conviction, but he has provided inconsistent explanations for his omission of the 2003\narrest. In his response to the SOR, he said he did not remember because he did not appear in court.\nAt his hearing, he claimed he was so focused on the details of the 2001 arrest, he forgot about the\n2003 arrest. Yet, in providing the details about the 2001 arrest in his e-QIP, he affirmatively stated\nhe had not been involved since 2001 in any other adverse criminal conduct. Based on the foregoing,\nGuideline E disqualifying condition 16(a)  applies here.\n27\nOf the mitigating conditions under this guideline, only 17(a)  and 17(b)  are potentially\n28\n29\napplicable to these facts. I conclude neither applies. Because he did not disclose the arrest until\nconfronted with the information in a July 2006 investigative interview, I cannot conclude Applicant\nmade a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his omission. Nor does the record support a finding his\nanswers resulted from improper advice. \n\n See footnote 18, supra.\n30\n Ax. I.\n31\n See footnote 21, supra.\n32\n See footnote 17, supra.\n33\n7\nThe Applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in requesting a\nsecurity clearance. Because false or incomplete information given in the questionnaire is capable of\naffecting the way in which Department of Defense personnel perform their official functions in\nobtaining complete and accurate information about an applicant, it is material.  Moreover, a false\nanswer is material even if there is no proof that it actually influenced an agency's investigatory\nfunctions. Concealment, misrepresentation, or omission of a material fact in a security clearance\napplication is an act of great security significance. In addition to its interest in a proper security\nclearance decision, the Department of Defense has a significant interest in ensuring that false and\nmisleading information does not interfere with its security clearance investigations. Applicant\u2019s\nomission of a more recent arrest may have affected the adjudicators\u2019 initial decision about\nApplicant\u2019s suitability, and he has not presented sufficient information to overcome negative\nimplications of the available information about his personal conduct. The Guideline E security\nconcerns are resolved against the Applicant.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines E and J. I have also reviewed the\nrecord before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  It is uncontroverted that Applicant was an accomplished student in\n30\ncollege  and that he has been successful in his professional career to date. While his personal\n31\ncircumstances have changed sufficiently to resolve the concerns about his past criminal conduct, his\nfailure to be completely candid about his background sustains the government\u2019s reasonable doubts\nabout his suitability for access to classified information. Such doubts must be resolved in favor of\nthe national security.  A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information before me\n32\n33\nshows that the Applicant has not yet overcome the government\u2019s reasonable doubts about his ability\nto protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected\nof one who holds a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):         \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.

Savarino, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on September 29\n2005. On June 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under drug use (Guideline H),\npersonal conduct (Guideline E), and criminal conduct (Guideline J). The action was\ntaken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on July 6, 2007. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on April 4, 2008, and the hearing was held on May 15, 2008. At the\nhearing, five exhibits (GE 1 through 3) were admitted in evidence without objection to\nsupport the government\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s ten exhibits (AE A through and AE J) were\nreceived in evidence without objection. Five witnesses testified in Applicant\u2019s behalf.\nApplicant testified. DOHA obtained a copy of the hearing transcript on May 27, 2008.\nJuly 16, 2008\n\n On May 12, 2008, Applicant recalled using marijuana in another country during his March 2004 European\n1\ntrip. \n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains one allegation under the drug involvement guideline, three\nallegations under the personal conduct guideline, and one allegation under the criminal\nconduct guideline. Applicant denied all allegations. \nApplicant is 29 years old and married. He achieved his Bachelor of Science\ndegree in May 1999, and Masters of Science degree (computer science) in May 2005.\nHe has been working as Senior Member of the Professional Staff for his current\nemployer since October 2006. In that position, he is a software engineer developing\ncode. He seeks a security clearance. \nDrug Involvement\nApplicant admitted using marijuana one time in the United States (U.S.) in\napproximately February 2004, before an eight-day trip to Europe in March 2004,  where\n1\nhe used marijuana two times in a coffee house of a European city in March 2004, four\ntimes in a coffee house in the same European city in May 2005, once in another\nEuropean city in May 2005, and at least one time in the U.S. in July 2005. (GE 4)\nApplicant is certain he has used no drugs since July 2005.\nPersonal Conduct\nAfter using marijuana on one occasion in July 2005, Applicant signed a security\nclearance application (SCA) (SOR 2.a.) on September 29, 2005, certifying on page 34\nof 35 that, \u201cMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete,\nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith. I\nunderstand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by\nfine or imprisonment or both. (See Section 1001 of Title 18. United States Code) In\nresponse to question 24.a. (since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is\nshorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana,\ncocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics(opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.),\namphetamines, \ndepressants \n(barbiturates, \nmethaqualone, \ntranquilizers, \netc.)\nhallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.) or prescription drugs?), Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d\nthereby denying any illegal use since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years. His claim is\nthat he realizes now the \u201cNo\u201d entry was untruthful. However, in September 2005 (when\nhe certified the security form), he knew marijuana use was legal in the overseas\nlocation, and he contended he did not remember his July 2005 marijuana use at the\nU.S. location. I find he deliberately falsified his answer to question 24.a. of the security\nform by not revealing his U.S. marijuana use. \n\n The year \u201c2003\" referenced in GE 3 is incorrect. (Tr. 118-120)\n2\n3\nWhile disclosing his overseas drug use in 2004  in his July 5, 2006 (SOR 2.b.)\n2\ninterview with a government investigator, he did not disclose his overseas drug use in\n2005 because he was ashamed/disappointed to admit it, and he did not want to\njeopardize his security clearance. (Tr. 94-96) For a second time, he did not disclose his\nmarijuana use in the U.S. in 2004 or 2005 because he contends did not remember it. I\nfind he intentionally provided false information about his drug use in July 2006. \nOn August 30, 2006, Applicant was interviewed and polygraphed by a\ngovernment investigator in connection with a second defense contractor position he was\napplying for. During the interview, he acknowledged his overseas drug use in 2004 and\n2005. After further discussion, he also admitted his marijuana use in the U.S. in 2004\nand 2005. \nOn October 12, 2006, Applicant was interviewed/polygraphed a second time. He\nprovided one additional drug use in May 2005 in a European country, and brief\nexperimentation of marijuana as a youngster. Following a second government\ninterview/polygraph on October 6, 2006, for the second defense contractor position,\nApplicant indicates he passed the polygraph. (Tr. 107) In November 2006, he submitted\nan updated SCA (AE F) reflecting his U.S. drug use to the second defense contractor.\nApplicant believes the position is still pending, but the specifications/characteristics of\nthe offer have changed in some fashion. \nOn December 4, 2006 (SOR 3.c.), Applicant was again interviewed by an\ninvestigator for his current position. While disclosing his overseas use of marijuana in\n2004 and 2005, he did not disclose his U.S. marijuana use. He stated:\nI - - I was afraid of what the - - the - - of the inconsistency with my previous\nstatements. And my second interview with DOD, I - - I put everything on\nthe table and now there were these other - - you know - -instances. And I\nwas just afraid of how it would look. I wasn\u2019t sure of how it would go over.\nSo I - - I know it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. And I decided not to disclose\nit. (Tr. 112) \nEven though he remembered his August 2006 disclosures of his U.S. marijuana\nuse, he did not disclose his U.S. use in his December 2006 interview. I find he\ndeliberately falsified his December 4, 2006 interview. \n\n4\nIn his responses to interrogatories dated June 1, 2007, Applicant affirmed the\nDecember 4, 2006 interview. He also added in the June 1 response the two instances of\ndrug use in the U.S. in 2004 and 2005. He knew his responses would be inconsistent\nwith the other information he had provided to the government about his drug use. In\nemphasizing the truth mattered to him, he stated:\nYes it did. I knew that I - - I wasn\u2019t forthcoming with the - - with the agents.\nAnd I just - - I wanted to clear it up. I didn\u2019t  - - feel good about it. I - - you\nknow - - it\u2019s just - - it\u2019s not - - it\u2019s not me. I don\u2019t - - I\u2019m - - I don\u2019t lie. I\u2019m not\na liar. I just wanted to - - I made a mistake and I - - I wanted to clear it up.\n(Tr. 115)\nCharacter Evidence\nWitness 1, the task order manager, has known Applicant for eight months, and\nwas his supervisor for five months. Witness 1 believes Applicant has produced good\nwork. According to Witness 1, the discrepancies in Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred\nbecause he had trouble remembering when he used marijuana, and with more\ninterviews, Applicant recalled more instances of marijuana use. (Tr. 29) \nWitness 2, also an employee of Applicant\u2019s employer since July 2000, has known\nApplicant for 12 \u00bd years, and is a personal friend. Applicant talked to Witness 2 about\nthe SOR, and Witness 2 interpreted the omissions of information as resulting from not\nremembering certain things. According to Witness 2, the missing information resulted\nmore from forgetfulness as opposed to an intent to conceal. (Tr. 40) \nWitness 3, Applicant\u2019s wife met Applicant in 2004 and married him in May 2008.\nHe talked with her about the SOR and using marijuana in 2004 and 2005. He told her\nhe did not remember some drug use, but there were times he felt ashamed and did not\nwant to reveal some drug use. She believes he has shown remorse and accepted\nresponsibility for omitting the drug information. His wife knows that Applicant currently\nshares her position against drug use. \nWitness 4, worked with Applicant until August 2007, and knows his wife. She\nbelieves he is very honest and reliable. She was surprised to learn he used marijuana in\nthe past because of his organic diet. Witness 4 believes Applicant was nervous during\nthe early interviews and did not recollect when he used marijuana; as he remembered\nmore drug use, he disclosed it. \nWitness 5, the project manager for Applicant\u2019s employer, stated that Applicant\nhas not been with the company long enough for a written performance evaluation.\nHowever, through the manager\u2019s interaction with Applicant on a weekly basis, the\nmanager has seen a very reliable employee produce a good work product. Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations of forgetfulness, nervousness, and deception, during the interviews were\nexplained to the manager\u2019s satisfaction. Based on his 23 years of military experience,\nwhere he has witnessed individuals in similar situations where they omit information, the\n\n5\nmanager does not believe these omissions should preclude Applicant from receiving a\nsecurity clearance. \nEight coworkers/friends provided character statements about Applicant. Witness\n6, a self-employed computer consultant, has known Applicant for 13 years, and\nconsiders him trustworthy and dependable. Witness 7 is a senior director of a company.\nShe met Applicant four years ago when they worked for the same company on different\nprojects. Through professional and social interaction, witness 7 found Applicant to be\ncompetent, and with much integrity. Witness 8 is a project manager for Applicant\u2019s\nemployer. Through daily contact as members at the same health club, witness 8\nconsiders Applicant a team player. \nWitness 9 is employed at another company as a senior consultant. He met\nApplicant on a project (2004). Witness 9 has socialized with him occasionally, and\nrecalled that Applicant attended his wedding in 2007. Witness 9 believes Applicant is a\ngood communicator who follows directions. Witness 10, a senior software engineer, met\nApplicant in December 2007. He is Applicant\u2019s coworker and also his supervisor.\nWitness 10's observations indicate that Applicant is a real team player who has 10\nyears of experience in full cycle-development of software systems. \nWitness 11 is an associate athletic director of community relations for a college\nwhere Applicant\u2019s wife attended. He met Applicant in January 2008. Witness 11 has had\nconversations with Applicant, and attended his wedding. Applicant has helped witness\n11 with his home repair. Based on this interaction, witness 11 believes Applicant is\nhonest and a team player. Witness 12 is a senior member at Applicant\u2019s employer, and\nis Applicant\u2019s coworker. He believes Applicant is honest, and conscientious, requiring\nlittle supervision.\nWitness 13 is an intellectual property associate for a law firm, and has known\nApplicant for 13 years when they were in school together. Witness 13 considers\nApplicant a close friend. Recently, Applicant helped renovate witness 13's basement.\nShe believes Applicant is dependable and consistently faithful to his friends. \nNone of the witnesses who testified have ever seen Applicant use any drugs. All\nwitnesses vouch for Applicant\u2019s honesty. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\n\n6\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nDrug Involvement (DI)\nDrug Involvement casts doubt on a person\u2019s willingness to comply with security\nrules and regulations. \nPersonal Conduct (PC) \nProviding dishonest or incomplete information during a security investigation\ndemonstrates poor judgment. \nCriminal Conduct (CC) \nViolating the law demonstrates poor judgment and generating legitimate\nquestions about a person\u2019s willingness to comply with security rules and regulations. \n\n7\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement (DI) \n24. The Concern. \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules or regulations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement falls within the scope of DI disqualifying condition\n(DC) 25.a. (any drug abuse) While Applicant\u2019s intentional falsifications about his drug\nuse weaken his overall credibility, there is no evidence of marijuana use after July 2005.\nThe passage of almost three years and the infrequency of use affords a sufficient basis\nto apply DI mitigating condition (MC) 26.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) in his\nfavor. Guideline H is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d\nDeliberate as opposed to unintentional omissions of material information are\ncognizable under the PC guideline. Examples of unintentional omissions are those that\noccur through haste, oversight or misunderstanding the question. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his SCA in September 2005, falls within the\nambit of PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire to determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness) Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications of his interviews in July and\nDecember 2006 fall within PC DC 16.b. (deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an investigator or other official government\nrepresentative).\nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances in this case. Those conditions are: PC MC 17.a. (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification, before\nbeing confronted with the facts); PC MC 17.c. (the offense was so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\n\n Even though I have resolved the drug involvement guideline in Applicant\u2019s favor, materiality is not limited only\n3\nto information that would affect a final agency decision, but also information (falsifications) relevant to the\nsecurity clearance investigation. See, ISCR 01-06870 (September 13, 2002) at pp. 5-6. \n8\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur). PC MC 17.a. is not applicable as Applicant did not make efforts to provide the\nfull scope of his drug history until he was confronted with the polygraph. PC MC 17.b. is\ninapplicable because Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications were not isolated, Rather, they\nconstituted a pattern of dishonesty that cannot be credibly reconciled as minor. The\nsecond element of the condition cannot be applied as the most recent falsification\noccurred less than 18 months before the hearing.\nRehabilitation from dishonest behavior begins with accepting full responsibility for\none\u2019s conduct. Given Applicant\u2019s struggles during the hearing to take full responsibility\nfor falsifying a government form and two interviews, residual concerns remain about his\njudgment and reliability that are not completely assuaged by his remedial behavior in\nsubmitting an undated security form in November 2006. Hence, the favorable mitigation\nApplicant receives under the first element of PC MC 17.d. in acknowledging the\nbehavior must be weighed against Applicant\u2019s persistence in trying to rationalize his\ndishonest conduct. His favorable character evidence from the witnesses provides a\ncommendable picture of Applicant\u2019s job performance and his conduct away from the\njob. However, his favorable attributes do not overcome his deliberate efforts to conceal\nhis U.S. drug use. \nCriminal Conduct (CC)\n30. The Concern. \u201cCriminal activity raises doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications under the PC guideline also constitute a\nviolation of Title 18 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 1001, a felony. Applicant\u2019s U.S.\ndrug history was material  to the government investigation into his security clearance\n3\nsuitability. CC DC 31.c. (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) applies.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions under the CC guideline. CC MC\n32.a. (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s\ninitial falsification of his SCA in September 2005 was more than 2 \u00bd years ago.\nHowever, his criminal conduct continued in July 2006 with his incomplete responses\nabout his drug use to an investigator. After he claims he disclosed all drug use in\nAugust and October 2006, he deliberately provided false information in December 2006.\n\n9\nApplicant receives limited mitigation under CC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement) His demonstration of\nremorse, his good employment record, and positive character attributes in non-work\nsituations, have been carefully evaluated. But, given the recency of his falsifications and\ntheir frequency, Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under the CC\nguideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the whole person concept. Nine general policy factors define the WPC.\nThey are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s intentional falsifications of his U.S. drug use in September 2005\n(SCA), July 2006 (interview), and December 2006 (interview) were serious. Each time\nApplicant falsified the SCA and the interviews, I believe he knew what he was doing.\nThe falsifications are aggravated by their repetitive nature. Applicant committed the\ndishonest behavior between ages 26 and 27. Two months before Applicant certified his\nSCA in September 2005, he used marijuana, even though the amount may have been\nsmall. In July 2006, Applicant disclosed an incomplete account of his overseas drug\nuse, but not his drug use in the U.S. Even after he purportedly provided the full history\nof his drug use in August and October 2006, he decided in December 2006 to withhold\nhis U.S. drug use that he had disclosed in August 2006. Applicant\u2019s character evidence\nweighs heavily in his favor, but does not overcome the adverse evidence under the PC\nand CC guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Criminal conduct, Guideline J): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s 2004 and 2005 assault charges led to a criminal conduct security concern. Both\nincidents stemmed from domestic issues involving either his wife or his wife\u2019s ex-husband. For the\npast two years, Applicant has attended marital and anger management counseling. Also, he has\nresolved the issues that caused the confrontation with his wife\u2019s ex-husband. He has mitigated the\nsecurity concern. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nTr. 22.\n1\nExhibit B.\n2\nExhibit C.\n3\nExhibit E.\n4\nSee generally, Exhibits H through L.\n5\nTr. 23.\n6\nTr. 41, Exhibit 2, Police Report, dated September 17, 2004.\n7\nTr. 42.\n8\n2\nOn May 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on May 16, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 22, 2007. On October 1, 2007, DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing scheduling it for October 24, 2007.  During the hearing, I received three\ngovernment exhibits, 14 Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on November 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, and I have incorporated them into the findings of\nfact. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old married man with two teenage children from a prior marriage and\nthree stepchildren. Two of the stepchildren are 14-year-old twins and the youngest is nine. His\nchildren live with his first wife, and his stepchildren live with him. He is active in the community,\ncoaching youth sports and attending practices for each of his five children. He is currently attending\ncollege, and anticipates earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration in December 2008.1\nFor the past 11 years, Applicant has worked as a security administrator. Coworkers describe\nhim as \u201cambitious and hardworking,\u201d  a \u201cman of dignity,\u201d  and \u201cextremely competent.\u201d  He has\n2\n3\n4\nreceived several awards over the years for outstanding performance.5\nApplicant has an anger management problem.  On September 17, 2004, he was arrested and\n6\ncharged with assault on a family member after he head-butted his wife, and dragged her across the\nfloor by her hair during an argument.  In May 2005, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12\n7\nmonths deferred probation. The court imposed no requirements on him other than to report monthly.8\nHe completed probation without incident.\n\nTr. 32.\n9\nTr. 61 - Wife\u2019s Testimony.\n10\nTr. 33.\n11\nTr. 33-34.\n12\nId. He had attended counseling approximately a year earlier for assistance with unrelated issues involving his\n13\nex-wife and visitation with his children.\nTr. 45.\n14\nTr. 56 - Wife\u2019s Testimony.\n15\nExhibit A.\n16\nTr. 47.\n17\nTr. 50.\n18\nTr. 51.\n19\nTr. 58-59.\n20\nTr. 59.\n21\n3\nOn March 12, 2005, while the first charge was pending, Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith assault after an altercation with his wife\u2019s ex-husband. Before the altercation, they had engaged\nin \u201cseveral run-ins and disagreements over the phone.\u201d  The disagreements related to the ex-\n9\nhusband\u2019s lack of steady child support payments and inconsistent visitations with his children.10\nAlso, the ex-husband had earlier challenged him to a fight at a neighborhood gym.  Because of their\n11\nanimosity, Applicant\u2019s wife arranged for pick-up and visitation with the ex-husband\u2019s children to\noccur at places other than Applicant\u2019s home. On this particular occasion, however, the ex-husband\ncame to Applicant\u2019s house to pick up the children. They exchanged words, and Applicant punched\nhim in the mouth.  The ex-husband filed a criminal complaint, leading to Applicant\u2019s arrest. The\n12\noffense was not prosecuted. \nAfter these incidents, Applicant voluntarily began marital and anger management counseling\nwith a licensed, professional counselor.  Initially, he attended approximately once per week.  For\n13\n14\nthe past year, he has attended approximately once every two to three weeks. Approximately 20\nsessions have been joint.  According to his counselor, he \u201chas made a great deal of progress in\n15\nworking on these issues which is evidenced by improvement in both his behaviors and interpersonal\nrelationships.\u201d  Specifically, he has learned techniques for preventing disagreements with his wife\n16\nfrom escalating into heated confrontations.  Also, he and the ex-husband\u2019s relationship has\n17\nimproved. The ex-husband is \u201cmore than welcome\u201d to visit his children in Applicant\u2019s home, and\n18\nhas done so four or five times over the past two years without incident.19\nAccording to Applicant\u2019s wife, he is less argumentative, and \u201cthinks before he speaks\u201d when\nthey have disagreements.  Arguments no longer \u201cdrag out.\u201d\n20\n21\n\nTr. .24.\n22\nId.\n23\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n24\n4\nApplicant is \u201cashamed of\u201d his past problems with controlling his anger.  He attributes it in\n22\npart to being raised in a household with a violent, physically abusive father. \u201cMore than anything,\n[he] want[s] to break this cycle\u201d and does not want it to be passed on to his children.23\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2)the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n24\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness, [and] by its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\n\nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b630.\n25\nA single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\n26\nThere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\n27\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\n5\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s two arrests trigger the application\n25\nof Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 31(a).26\nApplicant has voluntarily attended counseling for two years. The counselor noted that he is\nmaking significant progress. He has resolved his dispute with his wife\u2019s ex-husband, and has\nimproved his spousal relationship by being more willing to compromise and less confrontational.\nHis testimony projected remorse at his past transgressions, and he appeared sincerely committed to\npreventing any future episodes from occurring. Also, he is a good employee and is active in the\ncommunity. I conclude there is ample evidence of successful rehabilitation. Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition 32(d)  applies.\n27\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s 2004 assault of his wife was brutal. The assault of his wife\u2019s ex-husband less\nthan nine months later clearly established a pattern of his anger management problems. The 2005\nincident was mitigated somewhat by the ex-husband\u2019s mutual hostility toward Applicant, and the\nex-husband\u2019s callous attitude displayed toward his children\u2019s well-being. Moreover, these two\nepisodes represent the only times Applicant has ever been charged criminally.\nAt the hearing, Applicant expressed contrition and provided introspective testimony\nregarding the origins of his anger management issues. Also, he testified persuasively about the\nlessons he has learned through the counseling. His testimony was supported by his wife\u2019s testimony.\nEvaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concern. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\n\n6\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn August 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines F, E, and B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant partially answered the SOR in an undated response and subsequently \nprovided a complete answer on October 10, 2007. She elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record.

The FORM was mailed to Applicant \non December 4, 2007, and it was received on December 6, 2007. Applicant was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM. On December 11, 2007, \nDepartment Counsel submitted a supplemental file of relevant material. Applicant was \nafforded another opportunity to file objections and submit material. Applicant did not \nobject to the supplemental material and did not provide any additional information. The \ncase was assigned to me on January 31, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and they are incorporated \nherein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \nstatements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old contracts administrator who has worked for a federal \ncontractor since August 2006. She is a college graduate. She is married, but going \nthrough a divorce.  \n \n \nApplicant signed her security clearance application (SCA) on September 12, \n2006. She listed she had approximately $10,000 in credit card debts over 180 days \ndelinquent. She provided the following statement: \u201cI was out of work and didn\u2019t pay \ncredit card bills, working with debt consolidation to pay off creditors.\u201d1 Applicant does \nnot list any periods of unemployment on her SCA.2 \n \n \nIn response to interrogatories dated April 23, 2007, Applicant responded she was \nverifying all of the allegations in subparagraph 1, except the debts for her student loans \nthat were deferred. She also stated \u201cI was considering contacting a consumer credit \ncounseling service, but have not done so to date.\u201d3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 22 delinquent debts. Applicant admits in her answer dated \nOctober 10, 2007, she owes the debts alleged under subparagraphs \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.j, \n1.m, 1.p, and 1.v, totaling $27,986. She denies the remaining debts totaling $16,883. \nShe also has $55,000 student loan debt that is deferred. In her answer regarding \u00b6 1.a, \nshe stated she was \u201cworking to pay this account,\u201d \u00b61.b, she was \u201ctrying to work out a \npayment plan with this creditor,\u201d \u00b6\u00b61.f and 1.j she was \u201ctrying to work out a payment \nplan,\u201d \u00b61.m \u201cI have been unable to locate this creditor,\u201d \u00b61.p \u201cI am trying to get an \naddress to mail payments to for (sic) this account,\u201d and \u00b61.v \u201cI currently have a payment \nagreement.\u201d  \n \n \n1 Security Clearance Application provided with Supplemental Material.  \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Item 10. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant provided a document dated April 19, 2007, which indicates she paid \nthe debt in \u00b61.f; this debt had been delinquent since 2002.4 Applicant addressed some \nof her debts as follows: She provided an unsigned payment plan from the creditor in \n\u00b61.v.5 She provided a letter from a collection agency in \u00b61. q, indicating it was no longer \nthe owner of the debt and provided Applicant with the name and phone number of the \ncollection agency now holding the debt.6 She provided a letter from the creditor in \u00b61.d \n(who is the same creditor in \u00b6\u00b61.g and 1.h, both debts are judgments) indicating they \ndisagreed with her interpretation of federal law and they have alerted the credit \nreporting agencies that she disputes the account.7 She provided a letter from the \ncreditor listed in \u00b61.p stating that she only provided a partial account number so they \ncould not locate her account. They also explained to her information she needed to \nprovide and the place to send the information to verify the account.8 A similar letter was \nprovided from the creditor in \u00b61.c stating she had provided incomplete account \ninformation and provided her with contact information for assistance.9 No information \nwas provided by Applicant regarding what actions she has taken subsequent to the \nabove mentioned correspondence or regarding all of her other delinquent debts. \nApplicant also stated, \u201cI am currently working on verifying which debts listed on my \ncredit report belong to me as I am a victim of identity theft.\u201d10 She did not provide any \ncorroborating information about this assertion, such as a police report, a dispute with \nthe credit bureaus, or a request to monitor her credit reports.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to disclose on her SCA her marital status. She admitted she \nfalsified the information about her marital status.11 The explanation for why she did not \nlist her marriage on her SCA was: \u201cI am not aware of much of the information requested \nand thought it easier to explain as the form did not leave room for missing \ninformation.\u201d12 The question of ones marital status is uncomplicated. Ample room is \navailable on the SCA under the \u201cAdditional Information\u201d block to provide explanations. \nThat block was empty. Based on the information provided, I find she intentionally \nfalsified her SCA.  \n \n \n4 Item 5 at 6. \n \n5 Item 5 at 7-8. \n \n6 Item 5 at 9. \n \n7 Item 5 at 10. \n \n8 Item 5 at 11. \n \n9 Item 5 at 12. \n \n10 Item 5. \n \n11 Item 5. \n \n12 Item 8.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband is a citizen and resident of Guyana. It is alleged he works for \nthe government of Guyana. Applicant stated: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he still lives there. He is no \nlonger employed by the Guyanese government.\u201d13 Applicant failed to divulge her \nhusband\u2019s citizenship. No information was provided as to what job her husband held in \nthe Guyanan government, what contacts he maintains, or where he is currently \nemployed. On her SCA, she indicated that she took many short trips to Guyana from \nJune 2000 to June 2004. She did not directly answer allegation \u00b63.c which alleged she \ntraveled to Guyana in June 2000 for her marriage, once between 2000 and 2004, and \nonce in 2005.14 I find Applicant\u2019s failures to divulge the above information were \ndeliberate and intentional.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \n13 Item 5.  \n \n14 Item 5. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including \nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 for financial \nconsiderations that could raise a security concern and have especially considered AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d). Applicant has a history of delinquent debts extending from 2000 \nto present. She admitted she owes many of the delinquent debts. Most of them remain \nunpaid and she provided minimal information regarding any substantive actions she has \ntaken to pay or resolve the debts. I find both AG \u00b6 19 (a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered (a) \n(\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d), (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d), (c) (\u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d), (d) (\u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), and \n(e) (\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d).  \nApplicant owes thousands of dollars to numerous creditors and failed to provide \nevidence that she is addressing all of her debts. No information was provided to show \nthe delinquencies were beyond her control. No information was provided to show she \nactually followed through with credit or financial counseling. It appears she paid one \ndebt, but has not initiated a good faith effort to pay her other debts or resolve their \ndelinquent status. Applicant made one statement that she was the victim of identity \ntheft, but failed to provide information as to which debts she believed were not hers. \nShe admitted to over $22,000 in delinquent debt that was not part of an alleged theft. I \nfind none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct. Conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nI have considered all of the personal conduct disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16 and \nespecially considered (a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d). Applicant intentionally and deliberately falsified information \non her SCA by not listing her correct marital status and failing to divulge that her \nhusband was a citizen and resident of Guyana.  \nApplicant is a college graduate working as a contracts administrator. Her \nexplanation as to why she failed to list her marital was that she was \u201cnot aware of much \nof the information requested and thought it easier to explain as the form did not leave \nroom for missing information.\u201d There is a specific block on the form that allows for \nproviding additional information. Applicant chose not to use that block to provide the \nrequested information. Minimally she could have divulged she was married, but she did \nnot. She also chose not to divulge that her husband is a citizen and resident of Guyana. \nHer explanations are disingenuous and I find her omissions were intentional and \ndeliberate.  \nI have considered all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n16. Applicant knew she was married and knew her husband\u2019s citizen status, but failed to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nprovide this important required and requested information. She has not provided any \nmitigating evidence. Therefore, I find none of the mitigating conditions apply.  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: Foreign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7. I have \nespecially considered AG \u00b6 7 (a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d). I have considered all the information provided and \nconclude that Applicant is married to a citizen of Guyana. She deliberately falsified her \nmarital status and her husband\u2019s foreign status. She failed to provide a reasonable \nexplanation for lying on her SCA about this information. Her concealment of this \ninformation, by itself, creates a heightened risk. I have no information about her contact \nwith her husband, whether they live together, whether he provides financial support to \nher or visa versa. It is alleged that he works for the Guyanan government. She stated he \nno longer work there, but failed to provide any other information. The lack of information \nregarding either his former role in the government or present role creates a heightened \nrisk. With additional information that risk might be mitigated, but based on the lack of \ninformation provided, Appellant has failed to meet her burden of mitigation. I conclude \nno mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \n\n \n8 \n \n \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a long history of \nfinancial delinquencies. She has failed to address how she is resolving the debts and \nalmost all of them remain unpaid. Her answers are inconsistent as to what actions she \nwas taking to resolve the debts. She claimed she was a victim of identity theft, but \noffered no evidence to show her actions to resolve that issue. She admitted she lied on \nher SCA about her marital status. She failed to list her husband is a foreign national and \nany specifics about his employment or activities. Applicant deliberately and intentionally \nfalsified her SCA. Overall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nGuidelines F, E, and B. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c-1.v: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Mr. Keith Willeford, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant is a thirty-four-year old Iranian born, naturalized U.S. citizen, who has \nlived in the United States since 1998. She has substantially more connections to the \nUnited States than to Iran. Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iran. In \n2004, she showed her Iranian passport when she traveled to Iran. After a thorough \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and evidence, I conclude Applicant has \nrebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline C, foreign \npreference, and Guideline B, foreign influence. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on July 11, 2007, detailing the security concerns under \nForeign Preference and Foreign Influence. \n  \nOn August 29, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On October 16, 2007, I was assigned the case. On \nOctober 17, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on \nNovember 14, 2007. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted into evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf. The record was kept open \nto allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On November 14, 2007, additional \ndocuments were received. Department Counsel did not object to the material and it was \nadmitted into evidence as Ex. A and Ex. B. On November 26, 2007, the transcript (Tr.) \nwas received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HEx) I\u2500VIII. \n \n Applicant\u2019s counsel argued that the facts administratively noticed must be limited \nto matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. The \nfacts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the \nSOR, with explanations. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the record, case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old software engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since July 2005, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iran in 1973. In 1998 her parents \u2500 now ages 60 and 68 \u2500 \nhelped her and her two siblings leave Iran and move to the U.S. Applicant was 24 years \nold, her brother was 23, and her sister was 18. (Tr. 72) Her parents remained in Iran to \ncare for their parents who were old and sick. (Tr. 35)  Applicant\u2019s grandparents have \nsince died. In December 1997, she obtained an Iranian passport (Ex. A) in order to \nleave the country. She entered the U.S. as a refugee because of her faith. (Tr. 27, Ex. \n \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\n2)The passport initially expired in September 2002, but was renewed in May 2003, and \nexpired in June 2007. The expired passport has been cut up. (Ex. B)  \n \n \n \nApplicant showed her Iranian passport when she entered Iran in 2004. She had \nnot seen her parents since leaving Iran in 1998. When she left Iran, she knew there was \na real possibility she may never have seen her parents again. (Tr.45, 83) She was in \nIran 17 days visiting her parents. Her father was ill suffering from heart problems. She \nused her U.S. passport when she left Iran. (Ex. 2)  \n \nShe became a U.S. citizen in November 2003. Her parents\u2019 applications before \nthe United States Citizenship and Immigration Service have been approved and they \nare awaiting visas to come to the U.S. since 2005. (Tr. 30, 58, Answer to SOR) They \nhave been waiting since 2005. Neither of her parents have ever worked for or been \naffiliated with the current Iranian government. Before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, \nApplicant\u2019s father worked for the city government and her mother was a teacher. (Tr. 28, \n56) Applicant has no intention of ever visiting Iran again. (Ex. 2) She is willing to \ndenounce her Iranian citizenship. (Tr. 39) If someone tried to pressure her through her \nparents she would report it to the company security officer. (Tr. 45, 84)  She talks with \nher parents twice a month for ten minutes. (Tr. 49)  \n \n \nApplicant belongs to a faith that has been persecuted in Iran since 1979. Iran \ndoes not recognize it as a faith and people are not allowed to practice this religion in \nIran. (Tr. 28, 53) People of her faith have been specifically persecuted by the \ngovernment of Iran for practicing their religion. (Hex. 14, 15, 27) The Iranian \ngovernment defines the faith as a political sect linked to the Shah monarchy and Israel, \nand, therefore, counter-revolutionary. (Tr. 91) As a member of her faith she is not \nallowed to have an Iranian National Identification Card.  She believes the Iranian \ngovernment does not consider members of her faith to be Iranian citizens. (Answer to \nSOR) Members of her faith are not allowed higher education, to have a government job, \nto own land, and are not treated well in Iranian society. Applicant has no rights in Iran \ndue to her religion. (Ex. 2) \n \n \nAfter graduating high school in Iran, there was no way for Applicant to improve \nher life. She was not free to practice her religion, and could not get a job. There was no \nway to obtain a better job. (Tr. 34) Since coming to the U.S., Applicant states she has \nexperienced freedom and the \u201cAmerican Dream.\u201d She has obtained her bachelor\u2019s and \nmaster\u2019s degrees. She attended school full time and also worked full time on the night \nshift. (Tr. 73) She is married to a pharmacist and they have bought a house. Her \nhusband is a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 39) \n \nHer brother resides in the U.S., has a master\u2019s degree, and works as a senior \nassociate accountant for an auditing and professional services firm. (Tr. 31) He is \nmarried and has two children. Application could not be made until Applicant\u2019s brother \nhad become a citizen. (Tr. 63) Her sister resides in the U.S., has a master\u2019s degree, and \n\n \n \n \n4\n                                                          \nworks as a civil engineer. Both her brother and sister are U.S. citizens. (Tr. 32) Her \nuncle, his wife, and their son immigrated to the U.S. in 1988. They currently live in the \nU.S. Her uncle is a college professor. In 1984, her aunt, her husband, and their son \nimmigrated to the U.S. (Tr. 67) They live in the U.S. Her aunt owns a beauty salon. In \n2001, another uncle and his wife and two children immigrated to the U.S. All of her \nrelatives living in the U.S. are U.S. citizens. (Tr. 33) \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d  \n \nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n$ \nIran=s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction; \n$ \nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n$ \nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process;  \n$ \nIts dismal human rights record; and \n$ \nIran=s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.2 \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor \nof terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. The government \nof Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against the Iranian \npeople. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary executions, \nincluding of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; severe \nrestrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement and \nprivacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and legal \nand societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens\u2014even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian- \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \n \n2Background Note; Country Reports on Terrorism 2006, U.S. Department of State Office of the \nCoordinator for Counter-Terrorism, dated April 30, 2007 (country Report on Terrorism). . \n\n \n \n \n5\ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personnel possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n \n \n6\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Preference \n \nForeign Preference is a security concern when an individual acts in such a way \nas to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she \nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests \nof the United States. AG & 9. Additionally, the possession or use of a foreign passport is \na condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying. AG & 10(a) (1) \nApplicant did possess a now expired Iranian passport, which she used for identification \nwhen entering Iran in 2004. I find AG 10(a) applies.  \n \nEven individuals without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves \nIranian, are considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not \nrecognize dual citizenship. Because of her religious beliefs, Applicant is unable to hold \nan Iranian National Identification card and she does not believe Iran considers her a \ncitizen. Even individuals holding U.S. citizenship, under Iranian law, must enter and exit \nIran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian government has recognized a formal \nrenunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship.  \n \nApplicant showed her Iranian passport when she entered Iran in 2004. Her \nparents are the only relatives she has in Iran. They have been approved by the United \nStates Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service for entry into the \nU.S. They are awaiting notification from the National Visa Center at the State \nDepartment to have their visas issued.  She has no need of the expired Iranian passport \nand destroyed it by cutting it up. The Iranian passport had expired in June 2007.  \n \nAG & 11(e) sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns if the \npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or \notherwise invalidated. First, the passport is no longer a valid passport. It expired in June \n2007.  Second, the passport was destroyed.  AG & 11(e) applies.  \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, \n\n \n \n \n7\nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the \nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens \nto obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG & 6 \n \nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions. Conditions \nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying are listed under AG & 7. \nAG & 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion and AG & 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup, or country by providing that information, apply. Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens \nand residents of Iran.  \n \n \nIn 1989, Applicant \u2500 then age 25 \u2500 moved to the U.S. She obtained her \nbachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree. She became a U.S. citizen in November 2003. She is \nmarried and a home owner and has no foreign assets. Applicant has significant ties to \nthe U.S. and few ties to Iran.  \n \n\u00b6 8(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.\u201d and \u00b6 8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual=s sense of loyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s parents.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sense of loyalty is exclusively to the U.S. There is little likelihood \nApplicant has any conflict of interest.  If she did it is clear, due to her loyalty to the U.S. \nand the likely minimal nature of the conflict; that she would resolve the issue in favor of \nthe U.S.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n \n8\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is an established, highly regarded \nsoftware engineer, with U.S. ties and assets. Since coming to the U.S., Applicant has \nexperienced freedom and the \u201cAmerican Dream.\u201d  She has obtained her bachelor\u2019s and \nmaster\u2019s degrees. She is married to a pharmacist and they have bought a house. Her \nbrother, sister, aunt, uncles, and cousins resides in the U.S. Applicant stated she is \nloyal to the U.S. and would do nothing to compromise U.S. interests.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran and the heavy burden an \napplicant carries when she has family members in a foreign country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. Iran is the most active state sponsor of \nterrorism and has a dismal human rights record.  \n \nApplicant has strong ties to the U.S. with limited contact with Iran. Her financial \nties are in the U.S., and she and her husband own a home in the U.S. She owns no \nproperty and has no financial or business interests in Iran. All of her relatives, except \nher parents, are citizens and residents of the U.S., including her siblings, aunts, uncles, \nand cousins. Her parents have approved applications before the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Service and are awaiting visas to come to the U.S. Neither \nof her parents have ever worked for or been affiliated with the current Iranian \ngovernment. Applicant has no intention of ever visiting Iran again. Applicant has no \nrights in Iran due to her religion. Applicant\u2019s faith has been persecuted in Iran since \n1979.  As a member of her faith she is not allowed higher education, to have a \ngovernment job, to own land, is not treated as an Iranian citizen, and is treated poorly in \nIranian society. Her sense of loyalty is exclusively to the U.S. She will never return to \nIran. Applicant left Iran nine years ago and returned only once. Her parents are not \nconnected to any foreign government. These facts minimize any potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.  \n \nApplicant was sincere, open, and honest at the hearing. In the unlikely event that \nher parents were subjected to coercion or duress from terrorist groups, I find that with \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationships and loyalties to the U.S., including her uncompromising \ncommitment to this country, Applicant would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the U.S. \n \n\n \n \n \n9\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated or overcome the foreign preference and foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. I have no doubts concerning Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and \nsuitability. I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \n \nApplicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on September\n10, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 24, 2007 and the hearing was\nheld on November 27, 2007. At the hearing, five exhibits (AE 1 through 5) were\nadmitted in evidence without objection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s\nfour exhibits (AE A through AE D) were received in evidence without objection.\nApplicant testified. On January 7, 2008, Applicant submitted 15 pages of additional\nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n The exhibits contains documentation supporting Applicant\u2019s efforts to reduce and/or resolve those debts\n1\nlisted in SOR 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.i., and 1.l., as well as two debts not listed in the SOR. The exhibits also include\ninformation showing two payments in her debt consolidation plan. \n2\nexhibits. Those exhibits,  identified in the first two pages of AE E, were also received in\n1\nthe record without objection. DOHA obtained receipt of the hearing transcript on\nDecember 7, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the 11 allegations listed under the financial considerations\nguideline. She attributed the overdue debt to conditions beyond her control. Applicant is\n34 years old, and has a 10-year-old daughter. She seeks a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems in the early 2000s essentially parallel her job\nhistory (GE 1) when she moved back from State X to the local area in March 2000. The\njobs were of short duration and Applicant had to occasionally work two jobs to make\nends meet. \nFollowing her completion of high school in 1991, Applicant enrolled in a local\ntechnical institute for vocational training. In 1993, she was awarded an associate\ntechnical degree in specialized drafting. Her first drafting job was outside the local area.\nAfter two years, she returned to the local area and performed contract drafting work for\na temporary employment agency. After six months, she found full-time employment as a\ndrafter from 1995 to 1999. In this four-year period of employment, she starting a\nrelationship with her daughter\u2019s father. Though they never married, they built a house.\nApplicant gave birth to their daughter in 1997. Unfortunately, their relationship ended in\n1999. \nIn July 1999, Applicant took a job in State X as a drafter. Though she testified\nshe was employed at that location about 10 months, GE 1 indicates she ended the\nemployment in March 2000, after only seven months. Applicant did not know anybody at\nthis new location, and had difficulty handling the cost of living on a single parent\u2019s\nearnings. She also did not file her state income taxes. (SOR 1.a.) A lien was filed\nagainst Applicant in August 2003, and was satisfied in November 2007. (AE B)\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not filing and paying her taxes was that her father had\nalways prepared and filed her taxes. Her relocation to State X was the first time she was\naway from her father, so, she simply did not prepare and file them. She was unaware of\nthe tax lien until she obtained a copy of her credit report in 2006. Since her failure to file\ntaxes in 1999, she has learned how to file taxes and does every year.\nIn March 2000, Applicant moved back to the local area. She moved in with a\nfriend (single mom) and earned some money as a live-in babysitter. She also began a\ncomputer job that lasted until September 2000. In November 2000, she moved in with\n\n She even worked as a parking attendant for a short time. \n2\n The debts in SOR 1.g. through 1.l, though still past due, do not appear to be as delinquent as the others. \n3\n3\nher second boyfriend. Over the next several years, she recalled continual problems\nmeeting the rent along with other bills.\nShe worked five jobs (in and out of her field)  before she found a drafting job at a\n2\nregional university in September 2003. She was employed there until August 2006,\nwhen she began her current employment. \nIn 2003, Applicant purchased a house as investment property; she planned to\nrehabilitate the house before reselling. After six months however, she moved into the\nproperty. Having to pay a mortgage and other bills associated with raising a child\nwithout a second source of earnings, while driving 110 miles daily to and from work,\nexacerbated Applicant\u2019s already frail, financial situation, even though she was working\ntwo jobs occasionally. She recalled using her credit cards to pay for groceries as well as\nnonessential items.\nAlthough the SOR lists 11 debts, SOR 1.f. is the same as SOR 1.j. (AE 1 G) The\ndebts became delinquent between 1999 and April 2007.  The total indebtedness is\n3\napproximately $14,040.00. Applicant has resolved the debts in SOR 1.a., and 1.c.\nBetween October and December 2007, she was able to successfully restructure her\nmortgage. (SOR 1.e.) She has reduced the debt in SOR 1.l. to approximately 117.00.\nShe still owes the debts identified in 1b., 1.g., and 1.i. In October 2007, Applicant placed\nthe debts in SOR 1.d., 1.f., 1.h. and 1.k. in a 30-month, debt consolidation plan. She has\nmade two payments of $108.44 in the plan. \n\u00f7 1.a. As noted, this debt is a tax lien for $3,246.77 filed in August 2003 for not\npaying income taxes. The lien was satisfied in November 2007. \n\u00ff 1.b. A delinquent medical account ($225.00) was referred for collection in\nAugust 2004. Applicant is unaware of the origin of this account, but acknowledges that it\ndoes exist. \n\u00ff 1.c. The collection account ($167.55), charged off in March 2005, was paid in\nfull. Applicant received verification on December 21, 2007. (GE 2, AE N)\n\u00ff 1.d. This collection account ($774.00), referred for collection in July 2005, has\nbeen included with four other debts in Applicant\u2019s consolidated debt plan. (AE C) \n\u00ff 1.e. The mortgage account showing a deficiency of $1,347.00 as of May 10,\n2007 (GE 3), is now current after Applicant requested in October 2007 that the\nmortgage terms be modified downward. (AE D) After paying a modification fee of\n$500.00, and a late charge fee of approximately 204.00, Applicant\u2019s mortgage is now\ncurrent. (AE O)\n\n4\n\u00ff 1.f. This past due account ($5,835.00) has been included in Applicant\u2019s\nconsolidated plan. This is the same account as in 1.j. (AE C, G)\n\u00ff 1.g. This account is past due, but only by $24.00, not $625.00, according to\nGE 3. The account is still unpaid. \n\u00ff 1.h. This delinquent account ($501.00) is included in Applicant\u2019s consolidation\nplan. (AE C) \n\u00ff 1.i. This account ($609.43) remains delinquent, although the account does not\nappear in GE 3. \n\u00ff 1. k. This account ($462.79) is included in Applicant\u2019s consolidation plan. (AE\nC). Before entering this account in her debt plan, she had been making payments until\nFebruary 2007. \n\u00ff 1.l. The SOR lists this account as overdue in the amount of $1,500.00.\nApplicant had been making payments with the collection agency who purchased the\ndebt. She paid $200.00 to the collection agency in March 2007 (GE 2), and also a\npayment of $216.67 (postdated check) on November 19, 2007 to be cashed on\nNovember 30, 2007. The payment of $216.67 on November 30, 2007 brings Applicant\u2019s\nbalance on SOR 1.l. to approximately $117.00. (AE H)\nIn the last two years, Applicant has changed her spending habits. She has no\ncredit cards as she understands how they drew her into financial trouble. She only\npurchases those items she and her daughter need. The death of her stepfather in early\n2007, her estrangement from other familial members (no further information), as well as\nthe end of her seven-year-long relationship with her boyfriend, made her feel\noverwhelmed for a short time. But, rather than wallow in her depression, the relationship\nissues quickly provided additional incentive for Applicant to get her financial house in\norder. With the help of regular therapy, Applicant is confident she will be able to resolve\nall remaining financial problems. She has received two pay increases since her hire,\nand, an arrangement with her daughter\u2019s father will allow her to be able to work much\nmore overtime to help her expedite plans of resolving the debt. \nThough she has had no formal financial counseling, she has spent productive\ntime on the internet educating herself about various financial tools, such as the value of\ncredit reports and budgeting. She obtained her first credit report in September 2007.\nSince she enrolled in the debt settlement/consolidation plans, she has been trying to\nimplement a budget, but is having problems getting underway because of the lack of\nmoney. \nThree present and former coworkers provided character statements about\nApplicant. The site manager has known Applicant since August 2006, and enjoys her\nteam-player attitude. The production manager considers Applicant a real professional. A\nformer coworker at her previous job praised Applicant\u2019s common sense in getting jobs\n\n5\ndone properly. Three friends for varying lengths of time value Applicant\u2019s honesty and\ndedication. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n6\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, and inability to pay bills on time places the\nindividual debtor at risk of committing illegal acts to generate funds. \nAnalysis\nOn August 13, 2007 (date the SOR), Applicant had 10 delinquent debts totaling\nmore than $14,000.00. She accumulated these debts over the last four years. FC\ndisqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) applies due\nto Applicant\u2019s inability, not unwillingness, to pay those debts as they became due. FC\nDC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations) also applies based on the\nprogression of debts falling delinquent in August 2004 and thereafter. FC DC 19.g.\n(failure to file annual Federal, state, or local tax returns as required or the fraudulent\nfiling of the same) applies because of Applicant\u2019s failure to file and pay state income\ntaxes for the 1999 tax year. \nThe first four mitigating conditions (MC) under the FC guideline may apply to\novercome the adverse financial evidence. FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under the such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) must be removed from consideration as the record shows there were\ndebts falling delinquent as recent as April 2007. \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) has limited application. The record reflects the passing of Applicant\u2019s\nstepfather in early 2007 is the only traumatic and unanticipated event beyond her\ncontrol that could have caused or exacerbated Applicant\u2019s financial bad times. However,\nthe overdue debt that Applicant compiled between 1999 and her father\u2019s death is not\nreconciled completely by matters beyond her control. \nFC MC 20. b. cannot apply to Applicant\u2019s 1999 tax lien. Everyone is obligated to\nfile tax returns and pay taxes. The fact that Applicant was in State X, and could not have\nher father prepare her taxes does not mitigate her poor judgment in simply ignoring her\ntax obligation. \nThe accumulation of Applicant\u2019s remaining past due debt from August 2004 to\nApril 2007 receives some mitigation under FC MC 20.b. During the period from March\n2000 until Applicant landed her current employment in August 2006, she had difficulty\nfinding stable employment in her field, as is evidenced by the six jobs she had during\nthe period. She even worked for a time as a parking attendant. Aggravating her\nunderemployment and unemployment problems was her ill-advised purchase of the\ninvestment property in 2003. Paying a mortgage on only one income, while raising a\nchild and driving 110 miles to and from work every day from July 2003 to August 2006,\ndeserves some mitigation under FC MC 20.b.\n\n7\nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is under control) has\nlimited application to the facts as Applicant has spent time on the internet learning about\na credit report. She is trying to incorporate a budget into her financial practices. She\nenrolled in a debt consolidation plan. The fact she has resolved several debts, brought\nother debts to a current status, and placed other debts in a repayment plan, establishes\npersuasive evidence of a clear indication she is getting the debts under control. The\nSOR debts in 1.a. and 1.c. have been paid, and the debts in 1.d., 1.f., 1.h., and 1.k. are\nin the debt plan. \nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies to support the conclusion Applicant is\ngetting her finances under control. Having weighed and balanced the entire record with\nApplicant\u2019s favorable credibility, she has convinced me she is committed to finishing the\njob she launched in December 2006 when she paid off two unlisted debts. All\nsubparagraphs under the FC guideline are found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have weighed the circumstances of this case under the general factors of the\nwhole person concept. The comments from Applicant\u2019s supervisors indicate that she is\na competent employee. By eliminating her credit cards, by only purchasing items she\nand her daughter need, and by seeking internet help to improve her financial practices,\nshe has made the positive behavioral changes necessary to regain control over her\nfinances. I believe her resolution of most of the debts in the SOR, which she began\neven before she received the SOR, has been a cathartic process, dramatically\nimproving her financial habits as well as her self-esteem. The FC guideline is found in\nher favor.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Lebanon and the United States (U.S.) (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he possesses an identification document issued by the Lebanese government (SOR \u00b6 1.b) that he uses in lieu of a visa when traveling to Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline B, foreign influence, DOHA alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother is a resident citizen of Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that Applicant purchased the home in which his mother resides and surrounding land in Lebanon in 1997 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and that Applicant travels to Lebanon about one to two times per year with last trip of record in July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant admitted his dual citizenship, his possession and use of the Lebanese identification card, his mother\u2019s Lebanese residency and citizenship, and his purchase of his mother\u2019s current residence in 1997. He also admitted traveling to Lebanon, although not every year. Applicant denied any preference for Lebanon or that he could be subjected to foreign influence because of his ties to Lebanon.

On August 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline C and Guideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 21, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. On November 2, 2007, Department Counsel\nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed, but at the same time moved for\nadministrative notice of certain facts pertinent to Lebanon. On November 8, 2007, the\ncase was assigned to me to conduct a hearing on Applicant\u2019s security suitability. On\nNovember 13, 2007, I granted Applicant until December 3, 2007, to file any objections\nMarch 14, 2004\n\nThen assigned Department Counsel Fahryn Hoffman, Esq. filed the request for administrative notice. \n1\n2\nand/or to propose alternative facts for administrative notice. Applicant did not respond\nby the due date. On December 10, 2007, I scheduled a hearing for January 24, 2008.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on January 24, 2008. Four\nGovernment exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and eight Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-H) were admitted\nwithout any objections. Applicant also testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received\nby DOHA on February 5, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, and the facts for administrative notice, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn November 2, 2007, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be\ntaken of certain facts relating to Lebanon.  The request was based on publications from\n1\nthe U.S. State Department and the Congressional Research Service, and on three\npress releases from the U.S. Department of Justice. The government\u2019s formal request\nand the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the\nrecord. \nAt the hearing on January 24, 2008, Applicant presented a written response (Ex.\nC) in which he contested the relevance of the information about Lebanon to his security\nsuitability. After consideration of the source documents provided by the Government\nand of the respective positions of the parties, I agreed to take administrative notice of\nparticular facts, which are set out in the Findings of Fact.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant exercises\ndual citizenship with Lebanon and the United States (U.S.) (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he\npossesses an identification document issued by the Lebanese government (SOR \u00b6 1.b)\nthat he uses in lieu of a visa when traveling to Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline B,\nforeign influence, DOHA alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother is a resident citizen of Lebanon\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a), that Applicant purchased the home in which his mother resides and\nsurrounding land in Lebanon in 1997 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and that Applicant travels to Lebanon\nabout one to two times per year with last trip of record in July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.c).\nApplicant admitted his dual citizenship, his possession and use of the Lebanese\nidentification card, his mother\u2019s Lebanese residency and citizenship, and his purchase\nof his mother\u2019s current residence in 1997. He also admitted traveling to Lebanon,\nalthough not every year. Applicant denied any preference for Lebanon or that he could\nbe subjected to foreign influence because of his ties to Lebanon. After consideration of\nthe evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\n\n3\nApplicant is a 48-year-old program manager who has worked for his present\nemployer, a U.S. defense contracting firm, since January 2006 (Ex. 1). He is seeking a\nsecret-level clearance, having been granted an interim clearance (Tr. 24).\nApplicant was born in Lebanon in January 1960 to a Jordanian father and\nLebanese mother. Under Lebanese law, Applicant acquired the father\u2019s citizenship on\nbirth (Tr. 66). His father left them when he was only one month old, and Applicant was\nraised by his mother in Lebanon (Tr. 59, Ex. 3). He met his father once, when he was\nnine (Ex. 3).\nIn 1980, Applicant was accepted to a university in the U.S. (Ex. 3). Applicant had\nonly a birth certificate, so his mother took him to Jordan where he obtained a Jordanian\npassport that he used to enter the U.S. in 1981 (Tr. 66). On December 21, 1982,\nApplicant acquired Lebanese citizenship by presidential decree (Ex. 3, Tr. 67). Two\ndays later, he was issued a Lebanese passport that he used for foreign travel through\nOctober 1987 (Ex. 2). \nApplicant had two years of college in Lebanon at a private university before\ncoming to the U.S. (Tr. 63, 76). He finished his bachelor\u2019s degree in the U.S. in civil\nengineering and then obtained his master\u2019s degree in the same discipline in June 1984\n(Tr. 63). Applicant married in the U.S. in July 1982, but he and his first wife divorced in\nOctober 1985 (Ex. 1). After he finished his graduate study, Applicant decided to remain\nin the U.S. because of hostilities in Lebanon (Ex. 1, Tr. 63). He began working as\nmanager of product support for a provider of project management software systems\n(Ex. D).\nIn August 1987, Applicant married his current spouse, a native of Puerto Rico\n(Ex. 1). They have three children, daughters born in May 1989 and December 1990,\nand a son born in September 1999 (Ex. 1, Tr. 64). Within a few years of their marriage,\nApplicant\u2019s spouse obtained derivative Lebanese citizenship through Applicant so she\ncould take care of matters in Lebanon if something happened to Applicant (\u201cI mean I\njust have my mother there and I have to take care of her\u201d) and to facilitate his spouse\u2019s\nentry into Lebanon for vacations (Tr. 73-74).\nIn February 1989, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen (Ex. 1, Ex. 4). He\ntook an oath to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S.\nConstitution and its laws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian\nservice on behalf of the U.S. if required.\nFrom March 1994 to August 2001, Applicant worked as a program manager in\nthe semiconductor industry in the U.S. (Ex. 4). He and his spouse bought their home in\nthe U.S. in about August 1995 (Ex. 1, Ex. C). Applicant put a lot of work into his home,\nincluding hardwood floor, painting, and landscaping work (Ex. C). In 1997, Applicant\u2019s\nmother sold him her home in Lebanon and the surrounding 1 1/2 acres for nominal\nconsideration ($1.00) in accord with Lebanese tradition (Ex. 1, Ex. 4, Tr. 88-92). She\ncontinued to reside in the home (Ex. 4), which is located between Beirut and Tripoli in\n\nApplicant testified that someone in the village had to certify in writing personal acquaintance with him and the\n2\ndocument had to be presented along with his picture to some office in Lebanon (Tr. 69). He does not\nremember whether he or his mother applied for the ID card for him (Tr. 69-70). \n4\nthe heart of the Christian section (Tr. 50, 90). Applicant estimated the value of his home\nin Lebanon at about $100,000, but resale value was affected by the political situation\n(Tr. 90-93).\nIn late September 1998, he obtained his U.S. passport (Ex. 2). In October 1998,\nhe began to travel frequently to East Asia for business, and he stopped off in Lebanon\nto see his mother for a few days en route home in March 2000, September 2000, and\nFebruary 2001. He traveled on his U.S. passport (Ex. 2, Ex. C, Tr. 46). While he exited\nand entered Lebanon on his U.S. passport, he also presented a Lebanese identification\ncard that he had obtained in about 1999  so that he could avoid the costs of a visa and\n2\nhe could stay as long as he wanted:\nActually, Americans can get a visa at the airport, American citizens can,\nyou know, they don\u2019t need a visa, they can get it at the airport, so it\u2019s really\nI can pay $50 to get the visa and go in, the only difference is that they may\ngive you a visa for a month, or two or three versus this.\n(Tr. 70). Applicant\u2019s mother visited him and his family in the U.S. for a few weeks each\nsummer until about 2001 (Ex. 4, Tr. 78-79).\nApplicant had stayed on after a corporate acquisition until September 2001 when\nhe became unemployed (Ex. 1). That month, Applicant accompanied his mother back to\nLebanon. She had broken her ankle during a six-week visit with Applicant and his family\nin the U.S. and Applicant wanted to assist her (Tr. 79-80, 102). He stayed in Lebanon\nfor less than a week (Ex. E). That trip was also on his U.S. passport and Lebanese ID\ncard (Ex. 2).\nAfter about nine months of unemployment, Applicant went to work in July 2002\nas a program director for a supplier of secure media with security, identification, and\ndigital content applications (Ex. 1, Ex. D). He managed a program to supply a secure\nidentification system to Latvia (Ex. D), and traveled there on business in February 2004.\nBefore returning home, he went to Lebanon to see his mother for a few days (Ex. 2, Ex.\nE). In October 2004, Applicant traveled to Jordan on business. He stopped off in\nLebanon for about four days en route to Jordan (Ex. 4, Ex. E). In December 2004,\nApplicant and his family went to Lebanon for vacation since his wife and children had\nnever been there (Ex. E, Tr. 46, 86-87). He coordinated it with a business trip to\nAlbania, and spent another four days in Lebanon before returning to the U.S. in January\n2005 (Ex. E, Tr. 46). While in Lebanon, he had a two hour meeting with Lebanese\ngovernment officials regarding his employer creating driver\u2019s licenses for a new\nidentification program in Lebanon. The business meeting was arranged by his\nemployer\u2019s sales department (Ex. 4). All his trips were on his U.S. passport and he\npresented his Lebanese identification at the Lebanese border (Ex. 2, Ex. E).\n\n5\nApplicant was devoted to his work and he consistently met his commitments (Ex.\nG). Yet in September 2005, Applicant was again unemployed (Ex. 1). Applicant took a\nseven-day vacation to Lebanon to see his mother in late October/early November 2005\n(Ex. E). \nIn January 2006, Applicant took his present job as a transportation security\nagency program manager with an imaging technology company (Ex. 1). On February 7,\n2006, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) in application\nfor a secret-level security clearance (Ex. 1, Tr. 24). Applicant indicated that he and his\nspouse had dual citizenship with the U.S. and Lebanon, but that his children had only\nU.S. citizenship. He disclosed his mother\u2019s Lebanese residency and citizenship, as well\nas his ownership of his mother\u2019s residence and surrounding land in Lebanon. Applicant\nreported the two hour sales presentation to Lebanese officials in January 2005\nregarding their driver\u2019s license program, and contact with Latvian road and safety\ndirectorate officials from February to May 2004. He also reported his foreign business\nand pleasure travel since October 1998 with the exception of the business trip to Jordan\nin October 2004. Applicant did not report his Jordanian citizenship, but he disclosed his\nfather had been a native Jordanian citizen until his death. (Ex. 1) Applicant was granted\nan interim secret clearance for his duties.\nOn August 2, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for\nthe Department of Defense. Applicant admitted he was a Lebanese citizen, and\nindicated that any citizen born in Lebanon is a citizen of Lebanon for life, even if another\ncitizenship is acquired. He denied any voting in Lebanese elections, serving in\nLebanon\u2019s military, or exercising privileges/benefits of Lebanese citizenship, and\nasserted that his loyalties lie with the U.S. He added that his mother had worked for the\nLebanese government as a teacher until she retired. Applicant related that he visits her\nwhenever he can, about once or twice a year, and speaks with her about once a month.\nHe indicated that his mother used to visit him in the U.S. annually but that her health no\nlonger permitted it. Applicant explained his purchase of her home for $1.00 but averred\nthis foreign asset was insignificant in relation to his net worth. He denied any plan to\nreturn to Lebanon to live and was not sure what he was going to do with the home on\nhis mother\u2019s death. Applicant also explained his business contacts with foreign nationals\nduring his previous jobs, but the investigator\u2019s report does not mention Applicant\u2019s\nbusiness meeting in Jordan in October 2004. (Ex. 2) Asked whether he was willing to\nrenounce his Lebanese citizenship, Applicant told the investigator he would rather\nanswer the question later if he had to (Tr. 58).\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant on May 8, 2007, forwarded to\nDOHA copies of his current U.S. and expired Lebanese passports, which confirm he\nhad used his U.S. passport for all his foreign travel since acquiring U.S. citizenship.\nApplicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether he had obtained a visa to travel to Lebanon and\nindicated, \u201cA visa is not required for Lebanese citizens entering Lebanon on an\nAmerican passport.\u201d (Ex. 2)\n\nDuring his closing argument, Applicant offered to surrender possession of his Lebanese ID card to the\n3\nDepartment of Defense and asserted he can obtain the visa needed to see his mother (Tr. 135).\nAccording to the birth date reported on his SF 86, his mother turned 82 in January 2008 (Ex. 1). Applicant\n4\ntestified she was 83, however (Tr. 75).\nApplicant testified his mother was granted permanent residency several years after he became a citizen (Tr.\n5\n81). Since he did not obtain his U.S. citizenship until 1989, she was likely given her green card in the 1990s.\n6\nApplicant traveled to Lebanon for four days in July 2007 to attend an uncle\u2019s\nfuneral (Ex. 2, Tr. 48-49, 87). Applicant went to provide moral support for his mother (Tr.\n49). He entered and exited Lebanon with his Lebanese ID card and U.S. passport (Ex.\nE, Tr. 112-13).\nIn July 2007, Applicant was asked to authenticate the investigator\u2019s report of his\nAugust 2006 subject interview. Applicant indicated on July 19, 2007, that the report did\nnot reflect accurately all the information he had provided during his interview. He added\nthat he and a coworker had traveled to Jordan in October 2004 where they met with a\ncorporate partner from Iraq concerning providing driver\u2019s licenses in Iraq. (Ex. 4) In\nresponse to separate interrogatories about his travel to Jordan recorded in this U.S.\npassport but not listed on his SF 86 or disclosed during his August 2006 interview,\nApplicant indicated that if he had omitted the business trip from his SF 86, it was a\nmistake. He reiterated it had been discussed during his subject interview. Asked about\nrelatives in Jordan, Applicant indicated that his father had died 15 years before, and that\none uncle still lived in Jordan. In response to what documentation he presented to enter\nLebanon on his U.S. passport, Applicant provided a copy of his \u201c\u2018Ikraj Quide\u2019\u201d\n(identification card). Applicant reported recent travel to Lebanon in July 2007 on the\ndeath of his uncle. (Ex. 3)\nApplicant has never taken any action to renounce his Jordanian or Lebanese\ncitizenship. He has not used a Jordanian passport since he came to the U.S. in 1981,\nand does not think of himself as a Jordanian citizen (Tr. 67-68). He is willing to\nrenounce his Lebanese citizenship if it means he would maintain his clearance (Tr. 58,\n60, 71-72).3\nApplicant\u2019s mother is in her early 80's (Ex. 1, Tr. 75).  She lives by herself in the\n4\nhome she conveyed to Applicant for $1.00 consideration in 1997. She pays someone to\ntake care of her (Tr. 74-75). Her small village is located about 20 miles from the site of a\nbomb blast in June 2007 (Tr. 115). Applicant is not concerned because his mother is not\nin a group targeted by what he regards as \u201clower level, mafia type activity\u201d (Tr. 116-17).\nApplicant\u2019s mother had been a teacher of education at a government-owned\nLebanese university for 30 years before she retired (Tr. 75-76). She obtained her\nmaster\u2019s degree in the U.S. in 1952 (Tr. 81), and returned to Lebanon to finish her\nteacher\u2019s training (Tr. 75). She had legal U.S. permanent residency status in the 1990s5\n(Tr. 80), but \u201cbecause she was coming here every year they took it back\u201d and gave her\na five-year visa (Tr. 81-82). Applicant\u2019s mother has elected to stay in Lebanon because\n\nHizballah has been designated by the U.S. Department of State as a foreign terrorist organization. See State\n6\nDepartment\u2019s Fact Sheet, Foreign Terrorist Organizations, dated October 11. 2005.\n7\nof her health insurance benefit in Lebanon and friends/neighbors in Lebanon (Tr. 82-\n83). Even with health insurance, she spends about $150 a month on medication (Tr.\n110). She supports herself on her pension of about $300 to $400 a month and\nApplicant\u2019s financial assistance, which averages out to about $3,000 to $4,000 per year\n(Tr. 109-11). Two years ago, he had heat installed in the home for her (Tr. 96). He gives\nher checks for the year when he goes to Lebanon or sends the checks over with\nsomeone (Tr. 97). His mother handles paying any taxes or fees on the home (Tr. 98).\nApplicant is on his mother\u2019s bank account in Lebanon but he does not use her account\n(Tr. 98).\nApplicant now calls his mother every other Sunday and more frequently if\nnecessary to check on her (Tr. 76-77). She reports to him what is going on in Lebanon\n(Tr. 77). When Applicant travels to Lebanon to visit her, he also sees other maternal\nfamily members (his mother\u2019s brother and sister and cousins present) who reside in the\nsame small village (Tr. 78, 84). As of January 2008, Applicant had three cousins\nworking outside of Lebanon (two in Abu Dhabi and one in Saudi Arabia) because of the\nlack of work in Lebanon (Tr. 117). Applicant has gotten together with friends from the\nvillage on occasion when in Lebanon but he does not have regular contact with them\n(Tr. 85-86).\nApplicant is not sure what he will do with the property he owns in Lebanon on his\nmother\u2019s death. He regards it as \u201cnothing more than a summer vacation home at best,\u201d\nand denies he could be influenced even if the home were to be seized  (Tr. 94).\nAs of January 2008, the Lebanese government had issued a new identification\ncard which Applicant does not have (Tr. 112). When he went to Lebanon for his uncle\u2019s\nfuneral in July 2007, he entered on the ID card in his possession (Tr. 113). During his\nclosing argument at his January 24, 2008 hearing, Applicant was prepared to present\nDOHA with his Lebanese papers for destruction, not knowing whether his clearance\nwould be continued (Tr. 133). To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, no one in Lebanon knows he\nhas a security clearance (Tr. 114). \n*     *     *\nFollowing review of official publications of the U.S. government that address the\nhistory, economic and political activities in Lebanon, and its relationship to the U.S., I\ntake administrative notice of the following facts:\nLebanon is a parliamentary republic at the eastern end of the Mediterranean\nSea. From 1975 to 1991, it was convulsed in a religious and ethnically-driven civil war.\nRegional tensions persisted, with the terrorist organization Hizballah  targeting Israel\n6\nfrom within Lebanon and Israel retaliating. Israeli troops withdrew from Lebanon in May\n2000 after 22 years of Israeli occupation. The level of violence along the Israeli-\n\nApplicant testified the town is located about 20 miles from his mother\u2019s village (Tr.115). \n7\n8\nLebanon front decreased dramatically until a month-long war between Hizballah and\nIsrael in July/August 2006. The conflict ended in a cease-fire imposed by a United\nNations Security Council resolution and enforced by the presence of international\npeacekeeping forces in Lebanon.\nSyria, which views Lebanon as part of its territory, maintained a military presence\nin Lebanon from March 1976 until April 2005, when it withdrew under international\npressure. Syrian intelligence assets remain in Lebanon, and Syria continues to have a\nstrong influence in Lebanese politics. Influential persons in Lebanon critical of Syrian\ninterference in Lebanon have been targeted for assassination, and more than 32 have\ndied since October 2004. The U.S. considers Syria to be a state sponsor of terrorism.\nPro-Syrian forces, led by Hizballah, began months of massive demonstrations and\noccasional violence in November 2006 with the aim of bringing down Lebanon\u2019s\ndemocratically elected government.\n        \nLebanon has a mixed record with respect to human rights. The government had\ntaken significant steps to increase freedom of assembly and association and to prevent\nunauthorized eavesdropping of private citizens until the conflict between Israel and\nHizballah in 2006. There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances caused\nby government forces, but security forces abused detainees and in some instances\nused torture in 2006. There were instances of arbitrary arrest, government corruption\nand lack of transparency, restrictions on freedom of the press, limitations on freedom of\nmovement for unregistered refugees, violence against women and children.  \nLebanon does not have a history of targeting U.S. citizens to obtain protected or\nsensitive information. The U.S. seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties to Lebanon,\nand to help preserve Lebanon\u2019s independence, sovereignty, national unity, and\nterritorial integrity. The U.S. supports the full implementation of UN Security Council\nResolution 1559 that required all remaining foreign forces withdraw from Lebanon and\nthe disarming of all militias, including Hizballah and several Palestinian groups in\nLebanon. The Lebanese government has not taken the necessary steps to disarm\nextralegal armed groups, including Hizballah. Hizballah has a strong bloc of supporters\nin Lebanon\u2019s parliament, who continue to view it as a legitimate resistence group and\npolitical party. The Lebanese government has taken action against extremists linked to\nal-Qaida, but threats of attacks against western and Lebanese government interests by\nterrorist extremist groups, the assassinations in June 2007 and September 2007 of two\nanti-Syrian members of Lebanon\u2019s parliament, and bomb explosions in a town north of\nBeirut  and in Beirut neighborhoods since May 2007, led the U.S. State Department in\n7\nOctober 2007 to strongly urge American citizens to defer travel to Lebanon.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n9\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n\nIn its Consular Information Sheet, dated October 20, 2006, the State Department reports that American\n8\ncitizens entering Lebanon for tourism can purchase a short-term visa at the border.\nAG \u00b6 10(a) includes a list of actions considered as an exercise of a right, privilege, or obligation of foreign\n9\ncitizenship. Although the use of a foreign ID card is not specifically enumerated, the list is not all-inclusive.\n10\nAnalysis\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). Although\nborn in Lebanon, Applicant was solely a citizen of Jordan until after he came to the U.S.\nto continue his education in 1981. He acquired his Lebanese citizenship in late 1982,\nand his U.S. citizenship in February 1989. Applicant has not exercised his Jordanian\ncitizenship after entering the U.S. on a Jordanian passport, and did not travel on his\nLebanese passport after obtaining his U.S. passport. However, in 1999 he obtained a\nLebanese identification card and used it in lieu of a visa to enter Lebanon on his U.S.\npassport on about nine occasions between March 2000 and July 2007. As Applicant\ntestified (Tr. 70) and confirmed by the U.S. State Department,  Applicant could have\n8\npurchased a short-term visa at the border. With the Lebanese ID, he was not subject to\nthe time restriction or the cost associated with a visa. His active exercise of this benefit\nof foreign citizenship raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 10(a) (\u201cexercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member\u201d).  In the absence of  evidence showing he could\n9\ngain entry to Lebanon solely on this ID card without a valid passport, the risk is not of\nunverifiable travel, but Applicant could be prone to make decisions to protect this foreign\nbenefit.\nApplicant submits he is willing to renounce his Lebanese citizenship. Although\nthe Directive does not require that foreign citizenship be revoked for mitigation under\nAG \u00b6 11(b) (\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship\u201d),\nan expressed willingness is entitled to less weight if it is conditional. At his hearing,\nApplicant initially indicated that he was willing to renounce his Lebanese citizenship only\non assurances that he would retain his clearance if he did so (\u201cif that is the only issue,\nyou know, then I\u2019ll surrender it but if I surrender it and it\u2019s still going to be denied, then\nwhat\u2019s the purpose?\u201d Tr. 71).  However, during his closing argument, Applicant wanted\nto present me with his Lebanese papers for destruction, not knowing whether his\nclearance would be continued (Tr. 133).\nWhile the U.S. Government does not encourage its citizens to remain dual\nnationals because of the complications that might ensue from obligations owed to the\ncountry of second nationality, the Department of Defense does not require the\nrenunciation of foreign citizenship in order to gain access. Yet there must be adequate\n\n11\nassurances that a dual citizen will not actively exercise or seek rights, benefits, or\nprivileges of that foreign citizenship.\nApplicant could have renewed his Lebanese passport after he became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen but chose not to. By traveling on his U.S. passport even to\nLebanon, Applicant showed his preference for the U.S. While he presented a Lebanese\nID card at the border, it was for convenience in travel and not reflective of an affinity for\nLebanon. There is no evidence that he understood the concerns raised by his\nacceptance of this benefit of his foreign citizenship before the SOR was issued.\nAlthough at the eleventh-hour, his willingness to provide his Lebanese papers to the\nDepartment of Defense for destruction shows he can be counted on to not exercise any\nbenefit of his foreign citizenship in the future, which includes refraining from the use of\nthe foreign ID card. Applicant testified, with no rebuttal evidence from the Government,\nthat the Lebanese government issued a new ID card that he has not acquired (Tr. 112-\n13). The acquisition of derivative Lebanese citizenship for his spouse shortly after their\nmarriage was out of concern that his mother be taken care of rather than out of a\npreference for Lebanon. It is noted that his children are citizens of the U.S. only, and he\nis not likely to jeopardize his life in the U.S. or their safety by acting in preference for\nLebanon over the U.S. \nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant is close to his mother, who is a resident citizen of Lebanon (SOR \u00b6\n2.a). He provides her financial support, owns the home she lives in, and calls her\nregularly to check on her. While Applicant also has maternal relatives (an aunt, an\nuncle, cousins) and some longtime friends from the village whom he has visited in\nLebanon, the nature of his relationships with them is more casual and not likely to raise\na heightened risk. Although Lebanon and the U.S. have strong ties, Lebanon is a\nturbulent nation plagued by violence, and it is heavily influenced by Syria, a state\nsponsor of terrorism. The security concerns underlying AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\n\n12\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) are implicated\nbecause of his close ties to his mother in Lebanon.\nHowever, the Government did not establish its case for consideration of AG \u00b6\n7(b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation of technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information\u201d). Given Applicant\u2019s mother is an 82-year-old\nretiree living in a small village in the middle of Lebanon\u2019s Christian sector, there is\nnothing about her situation that presents a conflict of interest with his obligation to\nprotect classified information. While she benefits from health care and a pension in\nLebanon, it is not clear that these interests present a conflict of interest with Applicant\u2019s\nobligation to protect classified information. Applicant certainly wants to help his mother,\nbut that alone is not enough to fall within AG \u00b6 7(b). The concern is with the heightened\nrisk of exploitation, coercion, pressure, or influence because of his close relationship\nwith his mother, and that is covered more appropriately under AG \u00b6 7(a).\nApplicant owns the home his mother lives in and its surrounding acreage in\nLebanon (SOR \u00b6 2.b). He estimated the value of the house at about \u201c$100,000 maybe\u201d\n(Tr. 93), which is considerably less than the value of his U.S. assets (home ownership,\ncareer, other financial investments). Applicant testified credibly that \u201cthe house itself,\nassuming [his] mother is not there, they can do whatever they want, whoever they are, it\nwon\u2019t effect him\u201d (Tr. 94). While Applicant cares little for the house itself, this foreign\nproperty asset presents the potential for foreign influence as long as his mother is alive\nand living in the home. AG \u00b6 7(e) (\u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest\nin a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could\nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\u201d) applies.\nThe Government alleged separate foreign influence concerns about Applicant\u2019s\ntravel to Lebanon once or twice a year to as recently as July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.c).\nApplicant traveled to Lebanon on nine occasions since March 2000. Most of the trips\nwere of short duration to see his mother. AG \u00b6 7(i) applies where there is \u201cconduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country.\u201d\nThere is no evidence of conduct that would implicate AG \u00b6 7(i) with the possible\nexception of the use of the Lebanese ID card which was a legal exercise of his\nLebanese citizenship. The primary relevance of his foreign travel is that it confirms the\nclose relationship with his mother in Lebanon. \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d) is difficult to satisfy, given\nthe country involved is Lebanon. In October 2007, the U.S. State Department issued an\nupdated travel warning strongly advising U.S. citizens to defer travel to Lebanon due to\n\n13\nthe threat of terrorist attacks in Lebanon, relying in part on a June 2007 explosion in a\ncity that is located only about 20 miles from Applicant\u2019s mother. Applicant recognizes\nthe risk to physical security that exists in an unstable environment, but submits this \u201clow\nlevel mafia-type activity\u201d is targeted at politicians (Tr. 116-18) rather than at his elderly\nmother in a small village. Terrorism is not limited to indiscriminate acts of violence\nintended to incite fear. It often has political aims, and where it is allowed to operate\nunchecked or is condoned, one has to question the ability and/or willingness of a\ngovernment to protect its citizens against interference, coercion, or other abuses.\nHizballah\u2019s involvement in the Lebanese government and Syrian interference in\nLebanese affairs raise considerable concerns in this regard. Applicant\u2019s mother had\nbeen a professor at a public university in Lebanon for some 30 years and she now relies\nat least in part on her government pension. It is difficult to completely discount the risk\nof undue foreign influence, especially in light of Applicant\u2019s strong bonds of affection\nand obligation toward his mother.\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to undue foreign influence may nonetheless be mitigated\nby deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere\nis no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to\nthe foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d)).\nApplicant\u2019s actions show a primary loyalty to the U.S., where he has established roots\nsince 1981. On earning his master\u2019s degree, Applicant elected to remain in the U.S. In\n1987, he married a U.S. citizen and since raised three children, who are solely citizens\nof the U.S. In February 1989, he voluntarily acquired U.S. citizenship. All his\nsubsequent foreign travel has been with his U.S. passport in hand. But for the house in\nLebanon, which his mother essentially gave to him, his financial assets are all in the\nU.S. He exhibited pride in his ownership of his house in the U.S., and while he is listed\non his mother\u2019s bank account in Lebanon, he testified credibly to it being her account.\nApplicant showed some understanding of the concerns presented by his mother being\nin Lebanon by not informing others, including his mother, that he has a security\nclearance (Tr. 113). The  risk of undue foreign influence is not eliminated, but Applicant\nhas shown he is likely to recognize a potential conflict should one arise. AG \u00b6 8(b)\napplies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\n\n14\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty\nor allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet\nbe in an untenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family\nmember and the interests of the U.S. There is no indication that Applicant has ever\nintentionally acted in violation of his employers\u2019 or U.S. interests. By all accounts,\nApplicant is an ethical person who has a strong sense of obligation, not only to his\nmother in Lebanon, but also to his immediate family in the U.S. and to his employer.  I\nam persuaded that Applicant can be counted on to refrain from exercising any benefit of\nhis Lebanese citizenship in the future and to act consistent with the U.S. interests in the\nevent of any undue foreign influence.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n15\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated September 17, 2007, Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 60-year-old Senior Design Engineer. In 1972, he completed two bachelors\u2019 degrees, one in electrical engineering and computer science, the other in philosophy of science (epistemology). He has completed two masters\u2019 degrees. In 1984, he completed a master\u2019s in business administration, and in 1987, he completed a master\u2019s in computer science. Around 1989, he also participated in a PhD. program; however, he was unable to complete the program because of his job commitments (Tr. 5-6). Applicant married his first wife in June 1970, and they were divorced in December 1973. He married his present wife in May 1974, and they have two adult children, ages 28 and 21. He has held the same job for the same defense contractor (albeit under different names) since 1993. He has had access to classified information at the top secret level since 1993 (Tr. 6). There is no evidence that Applicant has ever compromised classified information or that he has failed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the protection of classified information.

On July 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).1  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 17, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nNovember 1, 2007, and I received the case assignment on November 6, 2007. That \nsame day, I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a scheduling delay pending his receipt of \nthe Government\u2019s investigation file which he had timely requested. After receipt of the \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJanuary 18, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ninvestigation file, on November 14, 2007, Applicant and Department Counsel agreed to \na hearing date of December 5, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November \n26, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 5, 2007. The \ngovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted exhibits (AE) 1 through 6, which \nwere received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 17, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nOn November 14, 2007, Applicant agreed to a hearing date on December 5, \n2007. The hearing notice was issued on November 26, 2007. At the hearing, I advised \nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the \nhearing. Applicant stated he was ready to proceed, that he had sufficient time to \nprepare for his hearing, and affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. at 18.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 17, 2007, Applicant denied all the \nSOR allegations. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his \ndemeanor and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old Senior Design Engineer. In 1972, he completed two \nbachelors\u2019 degrees, one in electrical engineering and computer science, the other in \nphilosophy of science (epistemology). He has completed two masters\u2019 degrees. In 1984, \nhe completed a master\u2019s in business administration, and in 1987, he completed a \nmaster\u2019s in computer science. Around 1989, he also participated in a PhD. program; \nhowever, he was unable to complete the program because of his job commitments (Tr. \n5-6).  \n \nApplicant married his first wife in June 1970, and they were divorced in \nDecember 1973. He married his present wife in May 1974, and they have two adult \nchildren, ages 28 and 21. He has held the same job for the same defense contractor \n(albeit under different names) since 1993. He has had access to classified information \nat the top secret level since 1993 (Tr. 6). There is no evidence that Applicant has ever \ncompromised classified information or that he has failed to comply with rules and \nregulations concerning the protection of classified information. \n \nIn 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application requesting an \nupgrade of his top secret security clearance to have access to secret compartmented \ninformation (SCI). His employer wanted Applicant qualified to handle possible future \ngovernment contracts requiring SCI access. In June 2005, as part of the security \nclearance upgrade investigation process, Applicant underwent a lifestyle polygraph \n\n \n3 \n \n \nexamination and interview. During the interview, consistent with his answers to the \nDOHA interrogatories (GE 2), Applicant admitted that: \n \n(1) Around 2002, he visited a store to have a duplicate key made. Irritated \nbecause of the time he had to wait for someone to cut the key and the long checkout \nlines, Applicant lost his patience and walked out of the store with the key without paying \n$1.25 for it (GE 2).  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant modified his answer to the DOHA interrogatory. He \ntestified he walked out of the store without paying for the key; however, he added that \nhe did not keep the key, that he threw it in a garbage can located outside of the store \n(Tr. 75). He admitted he exercised bad judgment by losing his temper, leaving the store \nwithout paying for the key, and throwing the key in the garbage can (Tr. 44-45, 79). \n \n(2) Around 2003, he visited a scuba diving shop. While shopping, he placed \nsome of the smaller items he selected, including a set of scuba mask lenses, inside of \nhis motorcycle helmet along with his gloves. Applicant claimed he paid for all the \nselected items, except for the scuba mask lenses (valued at approximately $29). He \nclaimed that, unintentionally, he failed to notice the lenses underneath of his gloves in \nthe helmet, and did not pay for the lenses. He noticed the lenses when he tried to put on \nthe gloves outside of the store. In his answer to the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant \nstated that rather than return to the store, \u201cand more than a little embarrassed,\u201d he \nsimply left without paying for the lenses (GE 2). \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant modified his answer to the DOHA interrogatory. He \ntestified that he was too embarrassed to go back into the store to return or to pay for the \nlenses.  Instead, he claimed he left the lenses on a ledge in the outside window of the \nstore (Tr. 52). Applicant explained he is not a thief. He admitted he exercised bad \njudgment when he failed to return the lenses to the store. \n \n(3) In 2004, Applicant purchased a set of patio furniture with a value around \n$800. He also purchased one additional piece of matching furniture with a value around \n$100 to go with the set of patio furniture. During the June 2005 interview, Applicant \nstated he reviewed the receipt at the store and immediately noticed he was not charged \nfor the additional item (Tr. 86-87).  \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated he did not review the \nreceipt until he got home, and then it became clear to him that he had not been charged \nfor the additional piece of furniture. He thought about driving back to the store to correct \nthe cashier\u2019s mistake, however, he failed to do so and kept the furniture (GE 2). \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified he was never sure whether he had been \ncharged for the additional piece of patio furniture. He said his wife believed he had paid \nfor it. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n(4) During his 2005 interview, Applicant told the polygraph interviewer that he \nhad shoplifted approximately 20 times in the past 15 years. At his hearing, he explained \nthat he had exaggerated the number of times he had shoplifted, and that he was pretty \nsure it was only about eight times (Tr. 150). He claimed he exaggerated his behavior \nduring the interview for several reasons, i.e., to shock the interviewer, because he was \nangry with the interview process, and because he wanted to embellish his statements to \nplease the interviewer (Tr. 102-107). He further told the interviewer he shoplifted \nbecause he did not want to waste his time waiting in line to pay for small items (Tr. 110).  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained that what he meant to say to the interviewer \nwas that because he was buying small items in bulk (nuts, bolt, and washers), he could \nnot guarantee that he had accurately reported to the cashiers all of the items he had \nselected for purchase. \n \n(5) At his hearing, Applicant also admitted he had told the 2005 interviewer that \nhe had shoplifted a $1 part from a motorcycle shop\u2019s display. He testified, however, that \nhe had not taken the part from the motorcycle shop display, but that he found the part in \nthe ground outside of the motorcycle shop, and he took it knowing it was not his. \n \nApplicant was questioned at his hearing about the contradictions between his \nhearing testimony and his answers to the DOHA interrogatories (which were consistent \nwith the statements he made to the 2005 interviewer). He explained that when he \nanswered the interrogatories he made sure his answers were consistent with the \nanswers he provided to the 2005 interviewer. He further explained that during the 2005 \ninterview, he was under a lot of stress, collapsed emotionally, and felt he could not \nexplain his answers. \n \nDuring the 2005 interview, the interviewer kept telling Applicant he was indicating \ndeception. Applicant testified he felt compelled to continue searching his past behavior \nfor incidents that could have been causing his deception. As a result, Applicant \ndisclosed all the incidents alleged in the SOR. He believed it would not have been in his \nbest interest to explain or mitigate his past questionable behavior. He averred he \nexaggerated his past behavior to please the interviewer (Tr. 64-70).  \n \nApplicant testified he has had an impeccable work record since 1993. He is a \nvalued employee, and his excellent work performance and significant contributions have \nbeen recognized via excellence awards and letters of recognition (AE 1). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide \ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. AG & 15.  \n \n \nDuring the last 15 years, Applicant shoplifted at least eight times. These incidents \nincluded the taking of a duplicate key with an approximate value of $1.25 in 2002; a set \nof scuba lenses with an approximate value of $29 in 2003; and, his failure to accurately \nreport to cashiers all the items he had selected for purchase. Additionally, he received \nand kept furniture he had not paid for. His actions show poor judgment, unreliability, \ndishonesty, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant provided a statement to a government interviewer describing \nthe circumstance of his shoplifting and lack of judgment. In his April 2007 response to \nDOHA interrogatories, Applicant made certain his answers were consistent with the \nstatements provided in 2005. At the hearing, Applicant recanted his answers to the \ninterrogatories, and provided exculpatory information not provided either during his \n2005 interview or in his answers to the DOHA interrogatories. Specifically, he claimed \nfor the first time that he threw the key in a garbage can outside of the store; that he was \ntoo embarrassed to go back into the scuba shop to return or to pay for the lenses, but \nhe left the lenses in a window ledge outside of the store; that he never reviewed his \nreceipt his patio furniture receipt while in the store, and that he was now not certain \nwhether he paid for the extra piece of furniture. I find Applicant\u2019s recantation and \ntestimony not credible. He tried to deny responsibility for his past behavior and \nminimized his past questionable behavior.  \n \n \nDisqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 16(c): \u201ccredible adverse information in several \nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any \nother single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information;\u201d and DC \u00b6 \n16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct , or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding . . .\u201d, apply. \n \n \n \nApplicant has held a top secret security clearance for approximately 14 years. \nExcept for the alleged misconduct, there is no evidence that he has engaged in any \nother misconduct or questionable behavior. Based on the available evidence, except for \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe shoplifting incidents, Applicant has been an upstanding husband, employee, and \ncitizen. Moreover, there is also no evidence to suggest Applicant does not follow rules \nand regulations pertaining to the handling of classified information.  \n \n \n \nAG & 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that none of the mitigating \nconditions apply to this case. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17(c), and find that although \nApplicant\u2019s offenses are indeed minor, his shoplifting forms a pattern of frequent \nbehavior that is likely to recur, and it casts doubts on his reliability and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is not applicable because Applicant has failed to take responsibility for his \nquestionable behavior. At his hearing, Applicant recanted prior statements and \nminimized his behavior. His lack of candor, honesty, and credibility weigh against a \nfinding that he has acknowledged his questionable behavior, and that he has taken \npositive steps to prevent its recurrence.  \n \n \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 17(e), Applicant failed to provide any evidence to show he has \ntaken steps to reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. He presented no evidence to show his family, supervisors, co-workers, and \nfriends are aware of his past questionable behavior. Applicant\u2019s recantation of his prior \nstatements and his efforts to minimize his past behavior, coupled with his demeanor \nand testimony, convince me he is highly embarrassed and ashamed of his past \nbehavior. As such, he is vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress to prevent \nembarrassment and ridicule. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well educated \nman. He has been successful as a husband and father. He is considered a valued \nemployee who has made significant contributions working for a defense contractor. He \nhas held access to classified information at the top secret level for approximately 14 \n\n \n8 \n \n \nyears. There is no evidence to show Applicant has ever compromised or caused others \nto compromise classified information. \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in his case, Applicant\u2019s pattern of \nquestionable behavior, coupled with his recantation, and his failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers at his hearing create doubts as to his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. I find that Applicant\u2019s recent lack of candor, honesty, and credibility \nundercut his claims of successful rehabilitation. Moreover, it shows Applicant is still \npotentially susceptible to pressure or coercion in order to cover his past questionable \njudgment and his embarrassing behavior.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

However, the Judge also took into account his strong ties to his\nTaiwanese family members, his voluntary trips to visit them, and a paucity of record evidence\nconcerning the relative strength of his obligations to the U.S. and his obligations to his family\nmembers in Taiwan.  Balancing evidence of the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, the Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  Id. at 7.\n\nApplicant stated, for example, that his wife was not born in the U.S., as the Judge had found, and that his\n1\nprevious employment in Taiwan was in a scientific, rather than a defense-related, field.   \n3\nApplicant submitted new evidence in support of his appeal.  The Board cannot consider new\nevidence in performing appellate review.  See Directive E3.1.29.  We have examined the Judge\u2019s\nfindings in light of the record as a whole.  The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are\nbased upon substantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)   To the extent that the Judge\u2019s findings may contain\nerror, such error is harmless in that it would not likely affect the outcome of the case.   A review of\n1\nthe entire record demonstrates that the Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts\nfound and his ultimate adverse security clearance decision, both as regards to the pertinent mitigating\nconditions and the whole-person analysis.   See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national security to grant\n[A]pplicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n May 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn October 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn October 23, 2007, applicant answered the SOR in writing, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 26, 2007. Applicant submitted\na response to the FORM on January 29, 2008. The case was assigned to me on March\n4, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\n\nExhibits 4 and 5 indicate applicant has a third sibling who is a citizen of Taiwan. Since the SOR did not\n1\nmention this sibling, she will not be discussed.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was born and raised in Taiwan. In the 1980s, after graduating from a\nTaiwanese university, he served a little less than two years in the Taiwanese military.\nThis service was mandatory. At some point he moved to the United States to pursue an\nadvanced degree. After receiving a Ph.D. degree from an American university in 1992,\nhe returned to Taiwan. According to applicant, he returned to Taiwan because he could\nnot find a job in the United States. After working for about four years for the Taiwanese\ngovernment in a national defense related position, he returned to the United States. He\nwent to work for his current employer in 1996. He became a United States citizen in\nMay 2002, and was issued a United States passport in June 2002.\nApplicant had a Taiwanese passport issued to him in 2001. When he traveled to\nTaiwan in December 2002, he used both his United States and Taiwanese passports. A\nJanuary 22, 2008 letter from applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s Facility Security Officer (FSO)\nindicates applicant surrendered the Taiwanese passport to him and it will be destroyed.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, to whom he has been married since 1991, is a native born\nAmerican. Their two minor children were born in the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and two siblings  are citizens and residents of Taiwan. In\n1\naddition to his above referenced 2002 trip to Taiwan, applicant visited Taiwan in 2000.\nBoth trips were for the purpose of visiting his parents and siblings. Applicant described\nhis relationships with these family members as \u201cclose,\u201d notwithstanding the large\ngeographical distance between them. Applicant speaks with his parents about once a\nmonth. He last saw them when they visited him in the United States in 2005. He speaks\nwith his siblings once every other month. \nIn his response to the SOR, applicant stated the following:\nBy law, the Taiwan government is not allowed to force a U.S. citizen to\nprovide protected information. I don\u2019t have any properties or money in\nTaiwan. Taiwan\u2019s human rights conditions have improved greatly in the\npast years . . . . The Taiwan government will not and could not use\nfinancial or my relatives in Taiwan to force me to provide any protected\ninformation. If there is such a situation occurs, I will immediately report to\nthe U.S. official or my company officer, even though I don\u2019t think this\nsituation would ever happen.\nThe Government provided 12 official United States publications with the FORM\nthat describe the political and intelligence activities of Taiwan. The Government\nrequested that these documents be admitted into evidence. I have admitted the\n\n3\ndocuments into evidence, and I take administrative notice of the following facts found\ntherein:\nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy with a population of about 23 million. It is one\nof the most active collectors of sensitive United States information and technology.\nNumerous individuals and companies have been subjected to civil penalties and or\nprosecuted for illegally exporting, or attempting to illegally export, sensitive United\nStates technology to Taiwan. One United States official was recently convicted of\ncrimes related to his improper relationship with a Taiwanese intelligence official.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Lastly, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d\nmay be disqualifying.\nApplicant has monthly contact with his parents, and less frequent but regular\ncontact with his siblings, all of whom are citizens and residents of Taiwan. In addition,\nsince moving back to the United States in 1996, he has visited Taiwan twice. Applicant\u2019s\npresence in Taiwan during these trips made him and his family members potentially\nvulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by the Taiwanese government. These\nfacts raise concerns under all three disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\n\n5\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s contacts\nwith his parents and siblings in Taiwan are frequent and ongoing. His relationship with\nthem is \u201cclose,\u201d raising the concern that these relationships create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation. Applicant failed to provide sufficient credible evidence that it is\nunlikely he would be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of\nTaiwan, one of the most active collectors of United States information and technology,\nand the interests of the United States, or that he is not vulnerable to a conflict of\ninterest.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10 a.1., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member, such as possession of a current foreign passport, may be disqualifying.\nApplicant possessed and used a Taiwanese passport after becoming a United States\ncitizen. Accordingly, this disqualifying condition applies. Under Paragraph 10.c.,\n\u201cperforming or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve the\ninterests of a foreign person, group, organization, or government in conflict with the\nnational security interest\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 10.d, \u201cany\nstatement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States\u201d\nmay be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s service in the Taiwanese military, and his return to\nTaiwan to work for the Taiwanese government after completing his graduate studies in\nthe United States, requires application of these two disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. Under Paragraph 11.c.,\nit may be mitigating if the \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign\ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual\nwas a minor.\u201d Applicant\u2019s military service and his employment with the Taiwanese\ngovernment occurred before he became a United States citizen. On the other hand, he\npossessed and used a Taiwanese passport after he became a United States citizen.\nThis mitigating condition applies in part. Under Paragraph 11.e., it may be mitigating if\n\n6\nthe \u201c[foreign] passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d Applicant surrendered his Taiwanese passport to\nhis employer\u2019s FSO, who indicated it will be destroyed. Accordingly, this mitigating\ncondition is applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2.a:\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2.c., the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant was born and raised in Taiwan. After performing his mandatory service\nin the Taiwanese military, he moved to the United States to continue his education,\neventually receiving a Ph.D. degree in 1992. He then moved back to Taiwan,\npresumably with his wife, to work for the Taiwanese government in a defense-related\nfield. He moved back to the United States in 1996 and has worked for his current\nemployer since then. Applicant\u2019s conduct since 1996 has, for the most part, indicated a\npreference for the United States over Taiwan. Although there is some evidence that\nindicates this preference is permanent (e.g., he obtained United States citizenship, his\nwife and two children are United States citizens), he has made no definitive statement\nconcerning his plans for the future, and has offered little to no evidence indicating he\nhas any significant ties to his community or to any United States citizens other than his\nwife and children. Given these facts, and the fact he has previously moved back to\nTaiwan, it is reasonable to believe he may again move back to Taiwan. This is\nparticularly so in light of the fact his parents and siblings reside in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s\nstrong ties with these immediate family members, as evidenced by his voluntary\nmonthly contacts with his parents and his less frequent but regular contact with his\nsiblings, and his voluntary trips to Taiwan to visit them, are not only relevant to the issue\nof the permanency of his preference for the United States, but also raise concerns\nabout his vulnerability. In view of Taiwan\u2019s status as one of the most active collectors of\nsensitive United States information and technology, these voluntary actions could leave\nhim vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure and could cause the future\ncompromise of classified information.\n\n7\nI have carefully reviewed the administrative record, applicant*s submissions, and\nthe allegations in the SOR. I have weighed the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nGuidelines B and C, and I have evaluated applicant*s conduct in light of the whole\nperson concept identified at Paragraph E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive. After doing\nso, I conclude that applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s case under Guidelines B\nand C.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He denied all other allegations under subparagraph 1 because he paid the accounts. In 1 addition, after a thorough and careful review of the evidence and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old and works for a defense contractor. He earned a Bachelor of 2 Science degree in 1995. He is married with two young children.

He accrued delinquent debts,\nsome resulting in judgments and a garnishment to enforce the judgment in 2004. He has paid the\nmajority of his debts. He has a repayment plan for the remaining two accounts. He has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concerns. Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 25, 2001, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On April 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)  of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nrevised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the\nSOR on April 27, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on June 18, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for July 9, 2007. Counsel for Applicant\nrequested a postponement. Department Counsel had no objection. By agreement, the case was\nrescheduled for August 21, 2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on August 21, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-8) were admitted. Applicant's exhibits (AE A-L) were admitted into the\nrecord without objection. Testimony was taken from Applicant. At Applicant's request, I held the\nrecord open for post hearing submissions until September 4, 2007. Applicant timely forwarded a\npacket of material, marked as AE M. Department Counsel had no objection. The hearing transcript\n(Tr.) was  received on September 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nApplicant's response to the SOR, dated April 27, 2007.\n1\nId. at 2.\n2\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated April 25, 2001).\n3\nTr. 25.\n4\nTr. 26-27.\n5\nGE 2 (Process of Garnishment, dated September 10, 2004); GE 3 (Writ of Garnishment, dated October 20,\n6\n2004).\nGE 4 ( Letter from Attorney, dated July 11, 2005 concerning foreclosure sale for mortgage).\n7\n4\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b, 1.c,  and 1.k are incorporated\nherein. He denied all other allegations under subparagraph 1 because he paid the accounts.  In\n1\naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the evidence and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 38 years old and works for a defense contractor.  He earned a Bachelor of\n2\nScience degree in 1995. He is married with two young children. He completed a security clearance\napplication on April 25, 2001.3\nApplicant and his wife decided to build an addition to their family home in 2001 to provide\nmore living space for their first child. Their first son was born in 2002. Applicant did the work for\nthe home improvement on his own and incurred some debt for the materials. He and his wife also\npurchased furniture for the baby and other related items. The debt was reasonable for the family\nincome of $150,000. At that time Applicant's credit was good, and he had no history of late\npayments. He and his wife had been married since 1994, and always paid their bills on time.4\nApplicant was traveling for his work extensively from 2002 until 2005. He was out of the\ncountry for six weeks at a time. During that time, a second son was born in 2004. Applicant was not\ninvolved with the family finances during this time. He was working six days a week and some of his\ndeployments were almost two months. His wife, who is highly educated, was handling the financial\nmatters. She was not working at the time, but she did not attend to the bills in a timely manner.5\nIn 2004,Applicant's pay was garnished because a judgment was placed against him for non-\npayment of an account. The account was charged off in the amount of $7,641.  When Applicant\n6\nreturned home and learned from his employer that his wages were garnished, he discussed the matter\nwith his wife. He understood from his wife that the account just slipped through the cracks and\neverything else was fine. He did not realize there were other instances of financial mishandling until\n2005.  At that time, Applicant received a letter from his attorney advising him that his home was\n7\nto be foreclosed. He immediately contacted the mortgage company. He learned that despite what his\nwife told him, there were missed payments on the mortgage. He withdrew an amount from his 401(k)\n\nTr. 28-30.\n8\n5\nto make payments and get the home out of foreclosure status. He also obtained a loan to take care\nof the fees and back payments.  \n8\nApplicant realized there was a serious problem that his wife was having in not attending to\nthe financial matters and not paying bills in 2005. They sat down and he told his wife how the\nfinances were to be handled in the future. He instructed his wife that the bills needed to be paid.\nHowever, his wife denied that there was any problem.\nIn January 2006, Applicant returned from his many travels. He again spoke to his wife and\ndecided to review all his financial records and call creditors to obtain a clear picture. He did\nspreadsheets and listed his accounts and balances. He called creditors who led him to collection\nagencies. He located the delinquent debt. As soon as Applicant learned the debts were delinquent,\nhe either paid them or entered into an arrangement to pay them monthly. He produced documentation\n\nTr. 29\n9\nTR. 61; 82.\n10\nTr. 64.\n11\nTr. 57; AE L (Credit Summary 2007).\n12\nThis amount increased from $7,641 due to interest and fees. This is also the same as allegation 1.j.\n13\nAE M (Letter from former employer)\n14\n6\nto support the status of the debts. He has two accounts that are not paid in full.  At the hearing, he\n9\nacknowledged that he had not focused on his own finances due to the extensive traveling.  He will\n10\nnot have to travel for his work since the mission is completed.11\nAt no time did he consider bankruptcy. His intent was to clear his credit and pay all\ndelinquent debt. He and his wife now have a family budget. The delinquent debt was contained in\nthe period from 2002 until 2005. He contacted three credit bureau reporters, and has identified\nnumerous errors.  He contacted a counselor regarding the delinquent debts.\n12\nThe current status of Applicant's alleged debts listed in the SOR is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\njudgment           $10,919\nPAID (2005)\nAE B.\n13\n1.b\ncredit card           $  2,811\npayment plan $300\nAE C and E\n1.c\ncredit card           $17,309\nPAID (2007)\nAE D\n1.d\ncredit card            $   368\nPAID (2007)\nTr. 37\n1.e\njudgment             $3,852\nPAID (2006)\nAE E and F \n1.f\ncollection             $4,169\nPAID (2006)\nAE G \n1.g\nsame as above\nPAID (2006)\nsame as above\n1.h\nconsumer debt      $3,580\nsettled (2006) \nAE.

This includes his wife's income. After\n18\nmonthly expenses, including $2,000 in debt repayment, Applicant has approximately $1,045 net\nremainder.  He lives a modest life style. They own both vehicles debt free. He does not use a credit\n19\ncard for personal use. However, he does use a  credit card for travel.  He and his wife are in solid\n20\nfinancial shape. They have a budget and financial plan. His savings have increased. His disposable\nincome is allocated to savings and his repayment plan. \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth set forth both disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts\nand circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct, (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes. (7) the motivation for the conduct, (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance.\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 11, 1997).\n21\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n22\n Department of the Navy v.

The government\n21\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n22\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n23\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n24\ndecision.25\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n26\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n27\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n28\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n29\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F of the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case. That guideline reads in pertinent part:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.30\n\n\"Even ifApplicant's financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his\n31\nor her control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with\nthose financial difficulties.\" ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4\n(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).\n9\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued delinquent\ndebts from 2003 until 2005. He had a garnishment in 2004 as a result of a judgment. He did not\ndispute the delinquent debts. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC\nDC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC, \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply. \nApplicant is an educated individual married to an educated woman. He was willing to pay his\ndebts, but due to his extensive work travel, he had no knowledge that his bills were not being paid.\nHe acknowledged that he was not focusing on his finances due to his work out of the country.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.   Therefore, FC MC, AG\n\u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant\nis not absolved from his financial responsibility even though his wife did not carry out her delegated\nresponsibility. His extensive travels may have been beyond his control but that is not sufficient for\nfull mitigation. However, he did act very responsibly when he learned that there were major  financial\nproblems.\nThe majority of bills are resolved. They were taken care of in 2004, 2005 and 2006. This\nperiod of time from 2003 until 2005 was  unique for Applicant and his wife. Applicant will not be\ntraveling for his work at this point. He and his wife have a budget and a good income. Applicant\nnever had any problems before or after this period while he was away from home. Therefore,\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC), \u00b6 AG 20(a), (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) partially\napplies.\nApplicant has  received financial counseling. He never ignored his creditors. He did not know\nthat the mortgage was not paid and going into foreclosure until he returned from his travels and\nreceived a letter from his attorney. He had not received notices before the 2004 judgment for the\ncharged off account until he received a letter sent to his employer. At the time Applicant learned his\nfinancial affairs were not in order, he took action.  He has a plan and a budget. He paid off his debts\nin accelerated payments. The remaining two accounts will be paid by 2008. There are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. He worked diligently to contact\ncreditors and credit bureau reporters. He accelerated payments and has two accounts that are in\nrepayment plans.  FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/ or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\napplies.31\n\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \"good faith\" effort to repay overdue creditors\n32\nor otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgo o d  faith\u201d mitigating condition], an\napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving theApplicant's debts. T he\nD irective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 H owever, the B oard has indicated that\nthe concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows\nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly,\nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available\noption (such as bankruptcy) in o rder to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating\ncondition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR C ase N o. 02-30304 at 3 (App. B d. Apr. 20, 2004)\n(quoting ISCR Case N o. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. B d. June 4, 2001)). \n10\nUntil 2004, Applicant had no financial difficulties. He paid his delinquent accounts, except\nfor two accounts left that are in repayment status. The other alleged debts are all satisfied. Some have\nbeen satisfied since 2005.  Therefore, FC MC, \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.32\nThe issue is whether Applicant acted conscientiously and with sufficient diligence to resolve\nhis debts, and whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed\ncircumstances to warrant a favorable security clearance decision. His two  remaining unpaid debts\ndo not constitute a security risk. He is not in a vulnerable position. He has a professional position with\na good income and has no other delinquent debt. \nWhole Person\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. He\nis an earnest, mature individual who was working very hard and traveling extensively out of the\ncountry. His focus on his mission, and reliance on his wife to keep all accounts current resulted in the\nfinancial delinquencies. His reasonable expectation was that his wife would attend to the financial\nmatters. She did not.  He accelerated payments and paid off the majority of the debts. By next year\nall of the debt will be paid. He took actions as soon as he learned about his situation. Prior to 2003,\nApplicant had a fine credit history. After 2005, he has had no new delinquent debt.\nApplicant is highly regarded in his profession. He is regarded as a man of integrity and\ncharacter. He took reasonable action to resolve the financial problems before the SOR was issued.\nMost of the debts have been paid, and the remaining debts do not raise security concerns. Under\nApplicant's current circumstances the likelihood of a recurrence of his previous financial problems\nis remote.\nApplicant has regained control of his finances. In sum, the likelihood of new debt problems\nis low. Applicant and his wife have been married for many years and until the incident in 2004 and\n2005,Applicant's bills were timely paid and his  credit history was fine. He used good judgment in\ndealing with the financial issues that arose. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has\nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n33\n11\nSubstantial evidence supports Applicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\nI take this position based on the law, my \"careful consideration of the whole person factors\"  and\n33\nsupporting evidence, as well as my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process\nand my interpretation of my responsibilities. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible\nfor his security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):       FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs1.a.- 1.k:                                           For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Department\nCounsel prepared a notice to proceed on December 18, 2007, and I received the case\nassignment on December 27, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 22,\n2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 11, 2007. The government\nMarch 26, 2008\n\nResponse to SOR, dated October 31, 2007.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SF-86)) at 1-2; Tr. at 18-20.\n2\nGE1, supra note 2, at 4; Tr. at 23-24.\n3\n2\noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted one exhibit (AE), which was received without objection. Applicant and four\nwitnesses testified on his behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nFebruary 27, 2008. I held the record open for the submission of additional matters.  He\ntimely submitted two exhibits AE B and C, which were admitted without objection. The\nrecord closed on February 25, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nCorrespondence in the file indicates that Applicant received the hearing notice on\nFebruary 4, 2008. At the hearing, he indicated that he received the hearing notice at\nhome within a week of January 22, 2008, the date of the notice. I advised Applicant of\nhis right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to receive the hearing notice 15 days before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. at 8-9.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 31, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c, 1.e, 3.a and 3.b of the SOR, with explanation. He denied the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 2.a, and 3.c of the SOR.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 33 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor.\nThe contractor hired him as procurement coordinator and has promoted him two levels\nsince he started working in June 2005. Prior to this employment, Applicant worked in\nmanufacturing companies where he rose to managerial positions.2\nApplicant married in November 1999. He and his wife divorced in March 2002.\nAfter his divorce, his life \u201crolled downhill\u201d for several years. More recently, he has\nbecome involved in his church and in bowling. His current girlfriend gave birth to his\ndaughter in December 2007.3\nApplicant began drinking at age 18, towards the end of high school. He initially\ndrank once a month. His drinking accelerated when he began dating his former wife. He\nand former wife partied frequently before and after they married. They often went to\nclubs on Fridays and Saturdays, where they drank and danced for an evening. In July\n1999, he, his future wife, and his future brother-in-law entered a nightclub, planning to\n\nResponse to SOR at 2; GE 4 (Answers to Interrogatories) at 3; Tr. at 26-29, 57-58.\n4\nGE 2 (United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation records) at 2; GE 3 (Answers\n5\nto Interrogatories) at 8; Tr. at 24-25, 31-33, 62-63.\n3\ncelebrate the future brother-in-law\u2019s birthday. His future brother-in-law got into a fight\nwhen they were at the club. He pulled his future wife out of the way of the fight. He tried\nto pull his future brother-in-law out of the fight. The bouncers threw all three out of the\nclub. He felt unfairly treated by the bouncers and tried to explain his side of the story to\nthe police. The police declined to listen to his story and told him to walk away. The\npolice officer then said \u201cIf you say one more word, I will arrest you.\u201d Applicant\nresponded \u201cFor what?\u201d The police arrested and charged him with disorderly conduct\nand refusal to obey a lawful order. He drank four beers before going to the club, but\nnone at the club. He denies any misconduct at the club. The court convicted him of\ndisorderly conduct and placed him on probation for one year.4\nAfter he married, he and his former wife continued to drink and party on a regular\nbasis, particularly on Friday and Saturday evenings. In March 2001, he started drinking\nin the afternoon at a pub with the husband of a friend of his former wife while waiting for\nthe wives. His former wife and her friend arrived at the pub around 7:00 p.m. They\nwanted to go out to a night club. He acknowledges that because of his alcohol\nconsumption, he was in no condition to go out. However, because his former wife\nwanted to go out dancing and drinking, he went. Later that evening, he and his former\nwife got in an argument. They left the nightclub and returned to their car. She refused to\ndrive. They argued more, then she jumped out of the car and ran down the street. He\nsped out of the parking garage and started looking for her. The police observed his\ndriving and stopped him. He failed a sobriety check and the police charged him with\ndriving while intoxicated (DWI). The court convicted him of DWI, fined him, placed him\non one year of unsupervised probation, and directed him to attend the first offenders\nprogram. He attended the first offenders program, paid the fines, and successfully\ncompleted probation. No professional diagnosed him as alcohol dependent or as an\nalcohol abuser at this time. He also attended four or five alcoholics anonymous (AA)\nmeetings, but stopped going to the meetings because he did not find the program\nbeneficial.5\nIn late 2002, Applicant called the police and requested a police officer come to\nthe marital home because his former wife, who was not living in the marital home,\nwanted to take items from their house. The police arrived, provided advice to both, then\nleft without making an arrest. In the incident report, the police noted that this incident did\nnot involve physical violence or threats. In February 2003, while trying to resolve issues\nrelated to selling this house, Applicant returned to the marital home where his former\nwife now lived and he did not. He knocked on the front door several times, but she\nrefused to answer the door. He called her on the phone, but did not speak to her. He\nhad keys to the house, but did not use the keys to enter the house. Instead, after five\nminutes, he left. His former wife called the police, alleging threatening phone calls. The\npolice did not talk with him, but filed a criminal complaint and asked the court to issue a\n\nResponse to SOR at 3, 10-11; GE 4, supra note 4, at 4; Tr. at 42-46, 79.\n6\nGE 4, supra note 4, at 4-6; Tr. at 49-53.\n7\nId.\n8\nGE 1, supra note 2; SOR.\n9\n4\ncriminal summons. The police never served Applicant with the summons. He never\nheard the telephone message. He denies making threats when he called his former\nwife.6\nA short time after the above incident, while offering condolences to his former\nwife and her family over the death of a close family member, his former wife started\ndiscussing some of the issues related to the sale of the house. Applicant declined to go\nto a financing company the next day as his former wife requested. Instead, a few days\nlater, he finally agreed to met his former wife at a financing company and to sign the\ndeed to house, which he did. As he left the financing company, his former wife\u2019s\nboyfriend attacked him and beat him up.  He received treatment for his injuries at the\nhospital. The investigating police officer refused to take any action against his attacker.7\nApplicant called a friend in the police department, and asked for assistance in\narresting his former wife\u2019s boyfriend for the attack on him. During this conversation,\nApplicant\u2019s friend determined that a warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest existed. The court\nissued a warrant for failure to appear at a hearing on the threatening calls charge.\nApplicant hired an attorney, who had the warrant quashed. He appeared for a hearing in\nMay 2003. Although his former wife never called the police to report threats or violence\nagainst her and the police never arrested him for domestic violence during his marriage,\nbased on her evidence asserting violence during their marriage, the court issued a\nprotective order, effective for five years, directing Applicant to remain at least 25 feet\nfrom his former wife. The order ends in two months. Applicant has not violated this\norder. He stays away from his former wife. By so doing, he avoids trouble.8\nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SF-86) in June 2005. He\nlisted the DWI in 2001 and the 2003 protective order. He also acknowledged unpaid\ndebts and an employment termination. He did not list his 1999 arrest because he forgot.\nHis failure to list this arrest is not an issue in this case because it is not alleged as a\nsecurity concern in the SOR. Moreover, his statement about forgetting to list the 1999\narrest is credible.9\nIn March 2006, spring volleyball began. Prior to a 9:00 p.m. game, Applicant\ndrank a couple of beers with friends, then attended the game. After the game, he drank\na couple of more beers with friends. He decided to drive home, a decision he now\nacknowledges was a poor decision. He sped through a yellow light. The police observed\nthis action and pulled him over for speeding. Because the officer smelled alcohol, he\n\nGE 5 (Court record on March 2006 DW I); Tr. at 34-37.\n10\nAE A (Report of Licensed Social W orker, dated February 11, 2008) at 1; GE 3, supra note 5, at 5, 15; Tr.\n11\nat 38-40, 58, 63-65, 67, 70-71, 85-88.\nApplicant purchased a house next door to his parents. His father is an alcoholic. Tr. at 70.\n12\nGE 6 (Adverse Information report, dated April 4, 2007; Tr. at 107-117.\n13\n5\nconducted field sobriety tests, which Applicant failed. The police officer issued a DWI\ncitation.10\nImmediately after his arrest, Applicant contacted a licensed independent social\nworker about counseling. He realized that alcohol was controlling his life. He began\ncounseling with the social worker shortly after his first contact. Initially, he met with her\nonce a week. After several weeks, he started meeting with her less frequently unless he\nneeded additional counseling time. He grew up with alcohol in the house. He thought it\nwas normal to drink and have problems because of alcohol consumption. He considers\nhimself an alcoholic. The March 2006 DWI opened his eyes about the effects alcohol\nwas having on his life. He no longer goes to clubs or bars. He has not consumed any\nalcohol since that date as he does not want alcohol to interfere with his life. He has no\nneed to drink. When he drank, he made bad decisions.11\nThe social worker testified on behalf of Applicant. She confirmed that he\ncontacted her in early April 2006 on his own initiative, and not at the direction of the\ncourt. From the beginning of their meetings, Applicant viewed their counseling sessions\nas an opportunity to change his views on alcohol use. She described him as forthright in\nhis discussions about his drinking habits and as taking responsibility for his drinking.\nShe later provided monthly reports to his probation officer, advising that Applicant was\nmaintaining his sobriety. She considers Applicant an alcohol abuser. She focuses on\nrelapse prevention by dealing with the underlying issues that relate to alcohol abuse and\nlooks at triggers. She does not believe that Applicant is at risk for a relapse as he does\nnot crave alcohol and because he lives with a family member who drinks, he solidified\nhis view on sobriety.  She describes Applicant as a social drinker, who changed the\n12\nhis social situations from clubbing and drinking to church and bowling.  This change is a\npositive for no relapse. \nApplicant reported his DWI arrest to his facility security officer (FSO) and his\nhuman resource contact within a week of his March 2006 arrest. The FSO testified that\nshe filed the adverse information report in September 2007 after she received all the\ndocumentation regarding Applicant\u2019s arrest, court hearing, conviction, counseling, and a\nfinal determination from the court on all issues related to his March 2006 arrest. She\nadvised Applicant to be honest during the interview with the investigator and answer\nexactly what was asked of him. She did not recall telling him not to disclose his arrest\nand didn\u2019t say anything to him about not volunteering information. Applicant provided\nher with all information she requested about his arrest.13\n\nTr. at 131-132, 134, 136, 138, 143.\n14\nGE 4, supra 4, at 3; Tr. at 41-42, 73-75, 77. \n15\nGE 5, supra 10; Tr. at 37.\n16\nAE B (Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation, dated December 20, 2007); Tr. at 96-103.\n17\n6\nThe human resource contact testified that the adverse information report was not\nfiled immediately because they were waiting for all the documents related to his arrest\nand court proceedings. She met with Applicant and discussed the investigative interview\nprocess. She could not remember if she told Applicant not to disclose his DWI arrest to\nthe investigator. She told him if the arrest was brought up he should disclose it. Her\nreason for providing this guidance to Applicant was that they did not have all the\ninformation and papers related to his arrest and court proceedings. Applicant complied\nwith her request for information about his arrest.14\nIn September 2006, Applicant met with the security investigator. At this time, he\ndiscussed the negative incidents report in his SF-86 and volunteered information about\nhis 1999 arrest for disorderly conduct. He did not volunteer any information about his\nMarch 2006 DWI arrest. He denies telling the investigator that he had no other incidents\nwith law enforcement and that the investigator asked if he had any other incidents or\ncharges not already discussed. The investigator\u2019s report states \u201c[Applicant] has no other\nincidences with law enforcement. Whatsoever.\u201d The statement in the investigative report\ndoes not make clear whether Applicant made this statement or the investigator\nassumed this fact from Applicant\u2019s failure to mention the 2006 DWI.15\nApplicant appeared in court in December 2006 for a hearing on his March 2006\nDWI. Applicant pled guilty to an amended charge of DWI first offense and to reckless\ndriving. The court sentenced him to 90 days in jail, which it suspended, 24 hours of\ncommunity service, one year of supervised probation, participation in a victim impact\npanel program, and directed the installation of an interlocking device on his car (if it\ndetects alcohol, the car won\u2019t start). Applicant completed all the terms of his sentence.\nThus, he did not serve any jail time.16\nApplicant\u2019s manager testified on his behalf. He described Applicant as very\ncompetent in his job. Applicant works very hard, has a strong work ethic, is very\nresponsive, and is very goal oriented. He finds Applicant reliable and trustworthy.\nApplicant has not used alcohol at work nor has he missed time from work because of\nalcohol. Since March 2006, Applicant\u2019s performance has improved as he is more\nproficient and knowledgeable. He has been promoted two levels.17\nThe FSO describes Applicant as a good employee, who puts in additional hours\nto get the work done. They have become good friends outside of work. She describes\nhim as a gentle, kind and friendly person with high morals. She has never seen him\nloose his temper. The human resource contact describes him as a hard worker, willing\nto take on extra duties. He is honest and sincere. He has not lost his temper at work,\n\nAE C (Letter, dated February 9, 2008); Tr. at 106-107, 130.\n18\n7\ndespite a tense work environment. Management has not advised her of any work-\nrelated stress issues. His law enforcement friend states that he is a person of high\nmoral values and h e is trustworthy. He is an asset to his employer.18\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n8\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 22, the following disqualifying conditions could raise a security\nconcern in this case:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent; and\n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program;\nApplicant received two DWIs for driving after drinking. After his first DWI, he\ncontinued to drink and drive. His alcohol consumption significantly increased when he\nstarted dating his former wife. He continued to consume significant amounts alcohol\nafter they married and after their divorce. Although he attended several alcohol\nprogram, he has never been formally diagnosed as an alcohol dependent. He considers\nhimself an alcoholic and his counselor, a licensed independent social worker, believes\nhim to be an alcohol abuser. The government has established that the above\ndisqualifying conditions raise a security concern.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n\n9\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\n \nApplicant last consumed alcohol two years ago. After he received his second\nDWI in 2006, he realized that alcohol was controlling his life and he wanted to change\nthe direction of his life. He sought counseling from a qualified professional. Because he\nviewed his counseling as an opportunity to change his life, he actively participated in his\ncounseling sessions. He has benefitted from his one-on-one sessions with his\ncounselor. He changed his social life from one of clubbing and drinking to church\nactivities and bowling. With this change, he developed new friends and a new way of\nlife. He continues with his decision not to drink alcohol. His counselor believes he is at\nlow risk for relapse because he does not crave alcohol and lives with or near his father,\nwho continues to drink. He recognizes the detrimental effects alcohol has had on his\nfather and does not want re replicate these problems in his own life. He does not drink\nwhen he is around alcohol. He has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his\nalcohol consumption.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(b) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n\n10\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\nApplicant met with the security clearance investigator in September 2006. He\nrevealed the 1999 arrest that he had not included on his SF-86. In completing the SF-\n86, Applicant listed several negative events in his life, including the protective order and\nhis first DWI. His second DWI occurred after he completed his SF-86, but before his\nmeeting with the investigator. He discussed the interview process with his FSO and\nhuman resources contact before meeting with the investigator. Since he had told them\nabout his DWI and he seemed to understand that the adverse information report had\nnot been filed, he asked how he should handle this information. Both told him to answer\nall questions asked. The FSO told him to answer the specific question asked by the\ninvestigator. At the hearing, both had memory lapses on the issue of volunteering\ninformation about his second DWI. When reviewing the interview process with\nApplicant, both knew the adverse information report had not been filed and most likely\nthe issue of the second DWI would not come up. From his discussions with both,\nApplicant believed that he did not have to reveal anything about the second DWI\nbecause his case had not yet been resolved in the court system. While Applicant denies\ndeliberately failing to provide the investigator with information regarding his 2006 DWI,\nhe knew that he had received a DWI six months before his interview. The government\nhas established its case.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to tell the investigator about his 2006 DWI occurred because\nthe FSO and human resources contact provided him with incorrect guidance about\nrevealing the 2006 DWI. The FSO knew the adverse information report had not been\nfiled, and thus, knew that the investigator probably did not know about the 2006 DWI.\nApplicant became aware of his need to provide information about his 2006 DWI when\nhe received the SOR. As he had done previously with the FSO and human resource\ncontact, he cooperated in providing information regarding the 2006 DWI. Given his\nopenness about his other incidents with law enforcement and his job termination, there\nis little likelihood that he can be coerced, pressured or exploited because he failed to\nreveal his second DWI to the investigator. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E, which is found in favor of Applicant.\n\n11\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern. The following\nconditions may be disqualifying:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nThe police arrested and charged Applicant with disorderly conduct and failure to\nobey a lawful order in 1999. In 2003, the police sought an arrest warrant based on\nallegations of domestic violence. Although the police never arrested him on the warrant,\nhe eventually appeared at a court hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court\nentered a protective order in his former wife\u2019s favor. These disqualifying conditions\napply.\nUnder AG \u00b6 32, the following conditions could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement. \nHis arrest for disorderly conduct is more than eight years old. The protective\norder is nearly five years old. Applicant has not violated the order, which expires in two\nmonths. Both of these incidents involved activities with his former wife and the 1999\narrest also involved alcohol use. He stays away from his former wife. By so doing, he\nhas little chance of getting involved in any altercations with her. His decision not to drink\nhas impacted his life positively. His social patterns do not involve the use of alcohol and\nhis new friends do not drink. He chose a new lifestyle which does not involve alcohol.\nHe changed his life because he understood his alcohol consumption was causing him\ntoo many problems. He made bad decisions after drinking and wanted to change, which\nhe has. He works steadily and is well-respected at his job. \n\n12\nConcerning the allegation of domestic violence and based on his demeanor at\nthe hearing, Applicant credibly testified that he did not threaten his former wife. The\nrecord is devoid of any evidence of domestic violence during his marriage or any prior\nallegations or charges of domestic violence. For Title 18 United States Code, Section\n1001 to apply, the government must prove that Applicant lied to the investigator. To\nmeet its burden of proof, the government must show that Applicant was asked a specific\nquestion and that his answer to the question was a lie. This proof is lacking in this case\nbecause the investigator did not testify and the statement  \u201c[Applicant] has no other\nincidences with law enforcement. Whatsoever\u201d is ambiguous. Applicant has mitigated\nthe government\u2019s security concerns regarding his criminal conduct.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant began drinking\nsporadically while in high school When he met his former wife, his drinking increased\nsignificantly and was a major part of their relationship. He continued to drink to excess\nfor another four years after his divorce. From 1999 t0 2006, the police arrested him on\nthree separate occasions for disorderly conduct or DWI. In addition, the court issued a\nprotective order directing that he stay away from his former wife. After his last DWI,\nApplicant realized that his alcohol consumption was causing too many problems. He\naccepted responsibility for his drinking habits and the ensuing problems. He sought and\nreceived counseling to help resolve his drinking issues. He changed his lifestyle. He has\nabstained from drinking alcohol for two years and has not interest in drinking alcohol in\nthe future. He has new friends who do not drink and participates in activities which do\nnot involve alcohol consumption. Since he stopped consuming alcohol, he has not been\ninvolved with the police. With his change in attitude about alcohol consumption and his\nchange in lifestyle, there is little likelihood that he will repeat his past misconduct. His\nstays away from his former wife because he does not want any new problems. He has\nmatured and become a more responsible adult.\n\n13\nApplicant is considered a reliable, dependable and trustworthy employee. He\nworks hard and as a result, he has been promoted. His company and co-workers like\nand respect him as an individual. He has a new daughter and looks forward to his\nparental responsibilities. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or\ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol\nconsumption, personal conduct and criminal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a technical writer/engineer with the same company since January 2002. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegation in \u00b6 1.a regarding a 1999 altercation, but denied the allegation set forth in \u00b6 1.b of the SOR regarding an arrest and guilty plea to a charge of Assault & Battery-Family Member. The scant narration he provided indicates, however, that while Applicant denies the substance of the charge, he concedes that he was arrested and pled guilty to the charge raised. Other than brief narratives regarding the two incidents, Applicant has declined to add additional information or submit exhibits supplementing the limited facts of record. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1982 through 2002. In the Navy, he served as a Chief Petty Officer [E-7]. He served on five nuclear powered submarines during his service and has maintained a security clearance for over 30 years. In October 1991, he remarried a former spouse, to whom he had been married from 1982 through 1987. In 1992, he attended college for a semester. By early 1999, his marriage was facing difficulties and he was estranged from his wife. On April 16, 1999, he was informed by a neighbor that his wife was seeing another man.

On July 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) regarding Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 23, 2007. He answered the\nSOR allegations in writing with brief narrative comments through a letter dated August\n5, 2007. In a supplement to that answer, notarized on August 6, 2007, Applicant\nexplicitly admitted the first allegation and denied the second allegation raised in the\nSOR. No written indication was given as to whether Applicant wished to have a hearing\nFebruary 14, 2008\n\n See File of Relevant Material (FORM) Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR, notarized on August 6,\n1\n2007, and supplementary letter of explanation, dated August 5, 2007).\n See FORM Item 2, supra footnote 1; DOHA legal assistant\u2019s cover letter of October 25, 2007, and DOHA\n2\nmanagement\u2019s letter of case assignment, dated January 31, 2008. \n DOHA\u2019s letter of October 25, 2007, advised Applicant of his opportunity to review the FORM and \u201csubmit\n3\nany material\u201d for the administrative judge\u2019s consideration or \u201cmake any objections\u201d as to the information set\nforth in the FORM.\n2\non the record or whether he desired to have the matter resolved through administrative\ndetermination.  \n1\nIn response to Applicant\u2019s answer, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM), which included a Motion to Amend the SOR to include three\nallegations arising under a second guideline, Guideline E (Personal Conduct). That\nFORM, dated October 24, 2007, advised Applicant of his opportunity to respond to the\nFORM within 30 days after receipt of the FORM. Further information as to how\nApplicant could respond to the FORM, its argument and contents, was included in a\ncover letter to the FORM, dated October 25, 3007, from a DOHA legal assistant. It also\nstated in its opening paragraph: \u201cYou requested that a determination be made in your\ncase without a hearing.\u201d \nApplicant received a copy of the FORM on October 31, 2007. Applicant did not\nsubmit any information or materials in response to the FORM within 30 days of its\nreceipt. Applicant similarly declined to address the motion to amend the SOR.\nDOHA received the case for assignment to an Administrative Judge for\nadministrative determination on January 31, 2008. I was assigned the case that same\nday. I reviewed the entire case file upon assignment and noted inconsistencies as to\nwhether Applicant actually waived his opportunity to have the matter decided\nadministratively. Specifically, I noted the lack of written indication that Applicant waived\nhis right to a hearing in his response to the SOR conflicted with DOHA representations\nthat Applicant had requested a determination without a hearing.  On February 4, 2008,\n2\nDepartment Counsel was contacted to ascertain the basis for the conclusion that\nApplicant had waived the opportunity for a hearing in favor of an administrative\ndetermination. Department Counsel acted expeditiously and, on that same date, a\nDOHA legal assistant delivered a copy of an August 8, 2007, facsimile transmission\ncover sheet which had accompanied Applicant\u2019s August 6, 2007, answer to the SOR.\nThat cover sheets states, in part: \u201cI do not wish to have a hearing. . . .\u201d I accept that\nsheet into the record as part of the FORM and the case file is now closed.\nFinally, I have reviewed Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR with\nthree allegations under a new guideline, Guideline E (Personal Conduct). That motion\nwas part of Department Counsel\u2019s FORM. I note that Applicant was given adequate\nnotice of the government\u2019s concerns. I also note that he had 30 days to respond to both\nthe FORM and the motion, and had the opportunity to proffer evidence in response to\nthe issues raised in the motion, but declined to do so.  I further note that the facts cited\n3\n\n Regarding the 2004 incident, Applicant\u2019s wife and her daughter told police officers that Applicant had\n4\nexposed himself in a lewd manner. There is no indication, however, if these statements were ever repeated,\nestablished, or known to Applicant in such a way that he had a duty to disclose them. \n U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Report, dated April 26, 1999.\n5\n Response to the SOR, dated August 5, 2007.\n6\n3\nin the amended SOR concern facts noted in the allegations arising under Guideline J.\nInasmuch as Applicant has declined to object to Department Counsel\u2019s motion, I grant\nthat motion and include the new guideline and allegations in my consideration of the\nSOR subject to the deletion of one sub-allegation, which the record does not\nadequately substantiate.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\n4\ntestimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a\ntechnical writer/engineer with the same company since January 2002. In his Answer to\nthe SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegation in \u00b6 1.a regarding a 1999 altercation,\nbut denied the allegation set forth in \u00b6 1.b of the SOR regarding an arrest and guilty\nplea to a charge of Assault & Battery-Family Member. The scant narration he provided\nindicates, however, that while Applicant denies the substance of the charge, he\nconcedes that he was arrested and pled guilty to the charge raised.  Other than brief\nnarratives regarding the two incidents, Applicant has declined to add additional\ninformation or submit exhibits supplementing the limited facts of record.\nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1982 through 2002. In the Navy, he\nserved as a Chief Petty Officer [E-7]. He served on five nuclear powered submarines\nduring his service and has maintained a security clearance for over 30 years. \nIn October 1991, he remarried a former spouse, to whom he had been married\nfrom 1982 through 1987. In 1992, he attended college for a semester. By early 1999,\nhis marriage was facing difficulties and he was estranged from his wife. On April 16,\n1999, he was informed by a neighbor that his wife was seeing another man.  He\n5\nbecame upset as more details about the affair were revealed. He confronted his wife by\ntelephone, then later when she arrived at his residence. The argument continued, the\ntwo fought physically, and Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault in the 3rd\ndegree. His wife incurred a concussion in the fracas. Applicant was eventually ordered\nto attend an eight-week Family Violence course in lieu of prosecution. Applicant\nconcedes he \u201clost [his] cool\u201d and apologizes for the incident.6\nOn March 12, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by the Defense Security Service\n(DSS). During the interview, Applicant stated that no one was injured during the April\n16, 1999, altercation and that this was the first altercation involving his first wife.\nOn December 24, 2004, Applicant and his next wife had been bickering and the\ntwo were drinking alcohol. At one point she fell and hit her head. Applicant helped her\n\n Id.\n7\n Item 5 (County Police Narrative Information, dated December 27, 2004).\n8\n Item 5, supra, note 6.\n9\n4\nto bed, but she eventually reemerged from her bedroom to join Applicant and her\nchildren from a prior marriage. Tensions remained high and alcohol flowed through\nDecember 25, 2004, and into December 26, 2004, during which time the bickering\ncontinued. On December 26, 2007, an altercation took place between the spouses. The\npolice were called and Applicant was arrested.   He was intoxicated at the time.  The\n7\n8\naltercation took place in the presence of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s children, including a 20 year\nold daughter. Applicant\u2019s wife and children were interviewed by the police. Although\nApplicant\u2019s wife stated she had received a head injury at the hands of Applicant, the\npolice noted that no injuries were observed.  \n9\nA magistrate issued a protective order and both husband and wife were served.\nApplicant was given a domestic violence brochure which also gave him a number for\nhis case. In court, he pled guilty to the charge(s) of Assault & Battery-Family Member\nbecause he did not have the funds to hire a defense attorney. Consequently, the\nvarious allegations and accusations were not adjudicated. Applicant was directed to\ncomplete a domestic violence course. Upon completion of the course and a two year\nsentence in suspension period, the charges were scheduled to be dismissed. A few\nmonths after the incident, Applicant transferred to an office in another state.\nOn January 5, 2005, in response to question from his security officer, Applicant\ndid not disclose he was intoxicated, as observed by the police, at the time of his 2004\narrest. He did not discuss how or if he threatened his wife. Applicant signed his\nexplanation as to the events of December 24 through December 26, 2004. As of\nJanuary 2005, Applicant was preparing to divorce his wife after a state imposed\nmandatory separation period. \nDuring an October 28, 2006, interview with an Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator, Applicant said he never became physical during the 2004\naltercation with his wife. He also stated he had never previously had adverse\ninvolvement with the police. He failed to disclose he was intoxicated when he was\narrested in 2004. He did not discuss how or if he threatened his wife during the\naltercation in 2004.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n10\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n11\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n12\n Id.\n13\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n10\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n11\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n12\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n13\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\n\n Id.\n14\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n15\n For the purposes of the disqualifying factors noted below, the allegation is sufficient to raise security\n16\nconcerns. Consequently, it is immaterial whether Applicant pled guilty for financial reasons.\n6\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n14\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n15\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct. The Concern: Criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.  \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct. The Concern: Conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate\nsecurity concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Criminal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), the Government has established\nits case. Applicant admits that he \u201clost his cool,\u201d was arrested in April 1999, charged\nwith Assault in the 3  degree, and ordered to attend an eight-week Family Violence\nrd\nclass. Applicant concedes he was arrested in December 2004 following an argument\nwith his wife and admits to pleading guilty to the charge of Assault & Battery-Family\nMember.  Such conduct and admissions are sufficient to raise security concerns, and\n16\ninvoke Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) 1, AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and CC DC 3, AG \u00b631(c) (allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted, or convicted), and initiate inquiry.\n\n7\nBecause so few facts have been presented by Applicant, and because he chose\nto have a determination on the record, the available facts lack context. What is clear is\nthat he was charged with assault in a marital context in April 1999. It is also clear that,\nfive and a half years later, a similar domestic incident occurred. Rather than seek a\npublic defender or otherwise fight the charge(s) pending, he pled guilty without\ndefending himself against a serious charge and scandalous accusations. This second\nincident occurred a little over three years ago. Consequently, it echoes an allegation\nfrom the past, and his reluctance to clear his name, if not from the actual charge, than\nfrom the accusation of exposing himself in front of a minor, demonstrates poor\njudgment. Therefore, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) 1, AG \u00b6 32(a) (so\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant was intending to divorce his wife as of 2005, potentially\nending any further marital conflicts, there are insufficient facts as to the circumstances\nsurrounding their disagreement and the altercation that occurred in 1999 to discern\nwhether CC MC 2, AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was pressured or coerced into committing\nthe act and those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life) applies.\nApplicant admits to the 1999 allegation, concedes a spousal altercation transpired in\n2004, and admits he pled guilty to the resulting 2004 charge. Therefore, CC MC 3, AG\n\u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense) does not apply. \nApplicant expressed his remorse for the 1999 incident and the incident is nearly\na decade old. He pled guilty, however to a similar charge in December 2004. The\npassage of three years since that most recent incident does not establish successful\nrehabilitation. This is particularly true when he introduced no facts which might\notherwise give rise to CC MC 4, AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement) and there is no assertion\nof meritorious circumstances of governmental waiver. As a result, the scant facts of\nrecord do not tend to mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns raised.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an one\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Special attention\nmust be given to any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant chose not to oppose the amendments to the SOR proposed by\nDepartment Counsel and which were ultimately accepted into the record in the absence\nof opposition to their inclusion. The record supports the facts that in mid-March 2002,\nApplicant was interviewed by the DSS. During the interview Applicant stated that no one\nwas injured during the April 16, 1999, altercation and further stated that this was the\n\n8\nfirst altercation involving his first wife. On January 5, 2005, Applicant did not inform his\nsecurity officer that he was intoxicated, as observed by the police at the time of his\n2004 arrest. He also did not elaborate on any specific threats waged against his wife. In\n2006, Applicant failed to inform an OPM investigator that he had been physical with his\nsecond wife on December 26, 2004, that he was intoxicated at the time of his 2004\narrest, and that he had made a threat against his wife during their fracas.  Such facts\ngive rise to Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 1, AG \u00b6 16(b)\n(deliberately providing false or misleading information regarding relevant facts to an\nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other\ngovernment representative) \nThe facts show that those allegations are correct. While allegations waged\nbetween spouses in a domestic violence context often amount to \u201che said, she said\u201d\nincidents, the cited incidents have a sound base in the record and Applicant has chosen\nnot to refute them. Consequently, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) 6\n(the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability) does\nnot apply. Although PC MC 3, AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) could, in some respects, apply, Applicant\nhas provided too few facts upon which a favorable application might be drawn. None of\nthe other mitigating conditions apply. Consequently, Applicant has failed to mitigated\npersonal conduct security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Here, little is known about the Applicant because he has declined\nto expand the record beyond the documents contained in the FORM and he chosen to\nonly address the Guideline J allegations. This is particularly troublesome given the \u201che\nsaid, she said\u201d nature of incidents like those described in the FORM which have not\n\n The facts of record include statements from his wives and his second wife\u2019s children, conflicting statements\n17\nand narrative from Applicant, and the more concise, abbreviated notes of attending officers.\n9\nbeen prosecuted and judicially reviewed.  What is known is that he is a mature man\n17\nwith 20 years of service to the U.S. Navy. He has considerable military and life\nexperience, and has been with his current employer for several years. The\ncircumstances surrounding the 1999 and 2004 incidents have been described outside\nthe context of Applicant\u2019s entire life and, indeed, of his marriage. The facts, however,\nshow that Applicant was a mature man when the first incident occurred, and that he\nwas then ordered to counseling about family violence. In 2004, he was a mature man\nwho had received family violence counseling when the second incident occurred. Even\nhad he been faultless in the second instance, that counseling should have apprised him\nof ways to extricate himself from a situation which could be misconstrued, just as\ncommon sense should have advised him to clear his name regarding the second\ninstance if the allegations made by his wife and daughter were untrue. As it now stands,\non the few facts provided, Applicant has a judicially unrebutted record for domestic\nviolence which extends to as recently as December 2004. Absent additional facts or\nevidence, criminal conduct security concerns remain unmitigated.\nThe facts also show that Applicant was less than forthcoming in his statements\nto the DSS and his security officer. While the unmentioned facts may have seemed\nminor to him in light of the bigger issues at hand (the altercations), security concerns\narise when there has been a lack of candor. Declining to address the Guideline E\nallegations, Applicant failed to raise facts which might tend to mitigate such security\nconcerns. Inasmuch as Applicant has failed to meet his burden and mitigate criminal\nconduct and personal conduct security concerns, I conclude that it is not clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is\ndenied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested that the case be\ndecided on the written record.  On March 31, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative\nJudge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s failure to mitigate the\nGuideline G, E and J security concerns under the mitigating factors and the whole person concept\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge found Applicant had consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of\nintoxication, from approximately 1996 to at least 2006.  In October 2005, he was charged with\nDriving Under the Influence (DUI).  His Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) at the time of the offense\nwas 0.163%.  He pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 30 days suspension of his\ndriver\u2019s license, 12 months probation, court ordered attendance at alcohol safety awareness classes,\nand 25 hours community service.  In May 2006, Applicant was again charged with DUI, this time\nwith a BAC of 0.21%.  He pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 30 months suspension\nof his driver\u2019s license, a $3,000 fine, two days in jail, 90 days of house arrest with electronic\nmonitoring, and 50 hours community service.  Applicant was on probation for the offense until\nNovember 2007.  He received treatment for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Dependence in the\nsummer of 2006, but did not complete recommended follow-up care.\nThe Judge also found that Applicant had used marijuana and cocaine from 2001 to at least\n2005, while holding a security clearance, and that he had falsified his Security Clearance Application\nby failing to disclose that use.\n The Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole and concludes\nthat she has drawn \u2018a rational connection between the facts found\u2019 under Guidelines G, E and J and\nher adverse decision.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn September 1, 2000, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). On June 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines G, E, and \nJ for Applicant. The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 3, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

From August 1998 until May 2000, he \nattended college. In August 2000, he began working as a field service engineer for his \ncurrent employer, a federal contractor. In September 2000, he submitted an SF 86. In \nJanuary 2001, he received a security clearance. (Item 3). \n \n \nApplicant started consuming alcohol and using illegal drugs at the age of 18. He \nadmitted that from approximately 1996 to May 2006, he consumed alcohol, at times to \nexcess and to the point of intoxication. He used marijuana for recreational purposes \nabout once a year until October 2005. He purchased and used cocaine about once a \nmonth from 2001 until 2005. He was never arrested for his illegal drug use and does not \nthink he was addicted to the drugs. He never received treatment for his usage or a Drug \nDependent diagnosis. He admitted the drugs impacted his judgment and reliability. He \ndisclosed the extent and nature of his substance abuse during an interview with a \ngovernment investigator in December 2006. (Item 4). \n \n \nAfter consuming four to six beers in a three-hour period in October 2005, \nApplicant drove his car and hit a parked car. He failed a breathalyzer test and was \nadmitted to the hospital where his blood alcohol level measured 0.163% and he tested \npositive for marijuana. After receiving 175 stitches to his head, he was released from \nthe hospital. He was charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence (DUI): High Rate of \nAlcohol (BAC 0.10-0.16) First Offense; (2) Driving Under the Influence: General \nImpairment/Incapable of Driving Safely First Offense, and (3) Careless Driving. He \n\n \n3 \n \n \npleaded guilty, and was placed on probation for 12 months. The court ordered him to \nattend alcohol safety awareness classes, and to perform 25 hours of community \nservice. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for 30 days. He reported his arrest to his \nsupervisor. (Items 4 & 6) \n \n \nOn May 16, 2006, Applicant felt stressed about his first DUI and the death of his \nmother. He stopped at a local bar where he began drinking beer. He left that bar and \nstopped at another one. Within five hours, he consumed 13-14 beers at several bars. \nOn his way home, the police arrested him and took him to the hospital, where his blood \nalcohol level was measured at 0.21. He was charged with DUI-Highest Rate of Alcohol \n(BAC 0.16+) First Offense. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two days in jail and \n90 days of work release/house arrest with electronic monitoring that he completed on \nFebruary 11, 2007. He was ordered to complete 50 hours of community service, fined \n$3,000, and placed on probation until November 2007. His driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended for 30 months and remains suspended. The sentence for this offense ran \nconcurrently with the one imposed in October 2005. (Items 4 & 5).   \n \n \nOn May 18, 2006, Applicant contacted his employer\u2019s assistance program (EAP).  \nThe EAP counselor referred him to an intensive outpatient program. He was diagnosed \nas Alcohol Dependent.1 He completed the 16 three-hour sessions satisfactorily in June \n2006. The counselor recommended that he participate in additional individual treatment \nwith another counselor. Applicant did not follow that recommendation, but continued \nattending AA meetings, which was also recommended. He claims he has maintained his \nsobriety since May 2006. He believes his prognosis is good because he is committed to \nchanging his behavior. His supervisor, colleagues and family are aware of his alcohol \nproblems. He regrets his misconduct. (Item 4).   \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86 in September 2000, he did not disclose his \nillegal marijuana use from 1996 to 2000.  He denied that he falsified the SF 86, and \nseemingly attributed the omission to his addiction at the time. (Answer).  \n \n \nApplicant submitted Performance Evaluations from his employer for the years \n2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. His supervisor rated him as a \u201cSuccessful Contributor\u201d for \nthe years 2003 to 2005 and as a \u201cBasic Contributor for 2006. (AE A). Although \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor is aware of his alcohol problems, it is not clear that the supervisor \nis aware of the illegal drug issues.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n                                                          \n1 The credentials of the evaluator, who made the diagnosis, are not included in the file. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a)-(g) describe seven Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions \nthat may be applicable to security concerns raised under this guideline. Based on \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two DUI convictions and admissions of excessive drinking over ten-years, \nthe Government raised two of them: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as \ndriving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\u201d and, \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to \nthe point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 22 (a) and (c). \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n23 (a)-(d): \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nOnly one of the conditions has any application to this case. Insufficient time has \npassed to apply AG \u00b6 23(a). Applicant was convicted of two DUI\u2019s within six months of \none another, and only recently completed his criminal probationary period in November \n2007. His driver\u2019s license remains suspended. AG \u00b6 23(b) has some application. \nApplicant admits his alcoholism and has taken steps to address it. However, he did not \nprovide any independent documentation to verify his assertion that he has remained \nabstinent since May 2006. There is no evidence in the record to support the application \nof AG \u00b6 23(c). Applicant acknowledged that he failed to comply with the treatment plan \nrecommended by the EAP counselor, as required by AG \u00b6 23(d). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the Government\u2019s personal conduct concern: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance \nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2(a) that Applicant falsified his SF 86 by \nfailing to disclose his use of marijuana from 1996 to 2000, thereby raising a potential \ndisqualification under AG \u00b6 16(a), which reads \u201cthe deliberate omission, concealment, \nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal \nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Although Applicant denied the \nallegation, he attributed the omission to his addiction at the time he completed the SF \n86.  Based on his explanation, I find that he deliberately concealed information from the \nGovernment. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2(b) that Applicant used cocaine and \nmarijuana from 2001 to at least 2005, while holding a security clearance that was \ngranted to him in January 2001. Applicant\u2019s admissions to those allegations raised a \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition under AG \u00b6 16(c). The security concern is \nbased on \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s decision to use illegal drugs \nwhile holding a security clearance was not alleged under any other guideline, but clearly \ndemonstrated his poor judgment and an unwillingness to comply with his employer\u2019s \nrules and regulations under this guideline. \n \nSeven Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions are set forth in AG \u00b6 17. They \ninclude the following: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \n\n \n7 \n \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \nAfter reviewing all of the conditions, I conclude six of them have no application to \nthe two disqualifications. AG \u00b6 17(a) cannot apply because Applicant did not disclose \nthe information about his drug abuse until December 2006. There is no evidence in the \nrecord to trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(b), (e), (f) and (g). Applicant\u2019s drug use \nwhile holding a security clearance was not minor or infrequent. He used illegal drugs \nonce a month after obtaining a security clearance in January 2001 and continued to use \nthem up to October 2005, demonstrating his lack of trustworthiness. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 \n17(c) does not apply.  Applicant acknowledged his substance abuse problems and \nreceived some counseling. However, that evidence is insufficient to assure the \nGovernment that similar problems will not recur in the future, given the extent and \nlength of time he abused substances. Hence, AG \u00b617 (d) has limited application, and \nthe factors listed therein, will be more fully discussed under the whole-person analysis \nsection.  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding criminal conduct: \n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nBased on the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government \nestablished a potential security concern under two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying \nConditions: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and an \u201callegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).  Applicant was convicted of a \nDUI and deliberately falsified his SF 86, which is a criminal offense under Federal law. \n \nThere are five Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 32. None of \nthe conditions mitigate the deliberate falsification allegation contained in \u00b6 3.a. \nHowever, AG \u00b6 32 (d) has some application to the allegations set forth in \u00b6 3.b of the \nAmended SOR, as \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement.\u201d  Since his conviction, Applicant has participated in some \nrehabilitation and has expressed sincere remorse for his mistakes and substance abuse \nproblems. He also provided evidence of a good employment record for the past couple \nyears.   \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In evaluating the \nconduct of the applicant, the Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 30-year-old man, who \nbegan voluntarily consuming alcohol and using illegal drugs when he was 18 years old, \nand continued abusing substances into May 2006.  From 2001 to 2005, he frequently \nused illegal drugs while holding a security clearance and apparently unbeknownst to his \nemployer.   \n \nApplicant asserted that he has maintained sobriety since May 2006 when he \nentered an EAP treatment program and is committed to that sobriety. While those are \n\n \n9 \n \n \npositive steps in addressing his substance abuse problems, they are inadequate to \nmitigate years of serious illegal drug use and alcohol abuse. Absent independent \ncorroboration, such as an evaluation from an appropriately credentialed health care \nprovider or other sources, documenting Applicant\u2019s assertions that he is drug and \nalcohol free, along with proof of a significant period of abstinence, I believe there is a \nstrong likelihood that he will continue to abuse substances in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption, \npersonal conduct and criminal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On October 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and H for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 1, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 15, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to\nApril 28, 2008\n\nResponse to SOR.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application) at 1, 3; GE 3 (police arrest report).\n2\n2\nproceed on December 10, 2007, and I received the case assignment on December 10,\n2007. This case was reassigned to another administrative judge because of work load\nadjustments. The administrative judge scheduled this case for hearing on February 6,\n2008. Subsequently, the administrative judge granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay by\nOrder dated January 29, 2008 and transferred the case to me. DOHA reissued a notice\nof hearing on February 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March\n10, 2008. The government offered three exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received\nand admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant  testified on his own behalf. He\nsubmitted three exhibits (AE) A through C, which were received and admitted into\nevidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March\n18, 2008. I held the record open until March 24, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional\nmatters.  On March 24, 2008, he submitted one exhibit, AE D, which was marked and\nadmitted without objection. The record closed on March 24, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nThe file information indicates that Applicant received the hearing notice on\nFebruary 25, 2008. I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15\ndays notice before the hearing. At the hearing, Applicant affirmatively waived his right to\nthe 15 days notice. (Tr. at 9.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 15, 2007, Applicant admitted all the\nfactual allegations of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n1\nApplicant is a 37-year-old software engineer, who works for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He completed his security clearance application (SF-86) on\nJanuary 31, 2003. Subsequent to completing his SF-86, the police arrested him on\nAugust 4, 2005 for the first time in his life.2\nApplicant graduated from college with a bachelors degree in philosophy and\ncomputer science in 1997. He married in 1999 and has two children, a daughter, age 8\nand a son, age 7. He and his wife separated in 2005 and are now divorced. His hobbies\ninclude indoor gardening, horticulture, hiking, skiing, and target shooting. He owns four\nguns, one an old .22 caliber rifle given to him by his grandfather and three properly\nlicensed guns. Along with plants, he grows tomatoes and peppers indoors in his\nbasement garden because his small yard lacks good soil and his two basset hounds run\n\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 2, 6, 8; Tr. 28-29, 32, 37-39, 44-45, 63-67.\n3\nGE 2 (Answers to interrogatories, verify statement to investigator) at 3-4; GE 3, supra note 2, at 4, 6-10; Tr.\n4\n33-35, 47.\nGE 3, supra note 2, at 13-22; Tr. 37-44.\n5\n3\nin the yard. To grow his indoor garden, he purchased various lighting equipment, fans, a\nconverter ballast, and a thermostat. He set up his garden in his basement in the same\nroom where he kept his guns and computers. He kept the room locked to prevent his\nyoung children\u2019s access to the guns and computers. This area also included the\nfurnace, hot water heater, cleaning supplies, vacuum cleaner and other household\nsupplies. He primarily used the room, but his wife had access.  \n3\nIn late June or early July 2005, Applicant observed a \u201cmysterious\u201d plant growing\nin his basement garden. He pulled the plant and threw it into a compost pile near an\norange bucket in his basement. On July 20, 2005, his anniversary, he arrived home\nfrom work to find the house locked, his children crying in the driveway, and his wife not\nat home. By July 29, 2005, he realized he had serious problems at home. He took a\nweek of leave from work to try and resolve the problems. During this week, he realized\nthat his wife was having an affair. He confronted her and they argued vehemently. The\npolice arrived. After some discussion, the police left. His wife left the family home and\npremise for awhile. She returned and attempted to remove the children from the home.\nApplicant tried to stop her. His wife left the premises, drove to the police station and\nswore out a complaint against him, asserting he had hit the car causing her to be afraid,\nbut did not mention any specific threats of harm to her that evening or in the past. The\npolice arrived at his house and arrested him, his first arrest for anything. His wife gave\nthe police permission to search the house after telling the police he grew marijuana in\nthe basement in a locked room to which he had the only key on a chain around his\nneck. She also told the police she did not go into the basement and Applicant had a\ndrug habit.  \n4\nThe police initiated a search of Applicant\u2019s residence. The police located a key to\nthe locked basement room to the right of the stairs. The police also observed a locked\nroom next to the utility closet. The police located a key in the area to open this room.\nApplicant did not provide the police with the keys. The police viewed and removed the\nfollowing items from the room: two .22 caliber rifles, one .45 caliber pistol, one AR 15\nrifle, ammunition, acurite thermostat, hydrofarm ventilation fan, hydrofarm grow light, a\nsecond light with convertible ballast, two glass pipes, light bulbs, white ventilation fan,\ntwo white PVC hydroponic irrigation systems (one in basement and one in the yard), roll\nof reflective backing paper, and one large suspected marijuana plant in orange bucket.\nHe attributes the presence of this plant to his wife or her friends.5\nThe police charged Applicant with domestic violence/child abuse, offenses\nrelated to marijuana, false imprisonment, harassment and possession of drug\nparaphernalia. At his preliminary hearing, the prosecutor informed the court that the\n\nAt the hearing, Applicant explained his understanding of the special offender charge under State law. This\n6\nparticular charge accompanies a drug charge when drugs and firearms are found in a search. The legislature\noriginally designed the law to target street drug dealers who carried weapons. Prosecutors use the law as a\n\u201ctool\u201d to obtain pleas from defendants.

The State declined to proceed on the remaining\n6\ncharges. The special offender law carries a mandatory minimum sentence of eight\nyears in jail, if convicted. The court issued a restraining order against Applicant and\nreleased him from jail. At the same time, his employer placed him on unpaid\nadministrative leave pending an investigation. He later resigned. He now works for\nanother Department of Defense contractor.7\nOn September 22, 2005, Applicant filed for divorce and filed a request for a\ntemporary restraining order (TRO) against his wife based on physical violence against\nhim by her and violence against the children. In his request, Applicant advised the court\nthat there was a restraining order against him for domestic violence and false\nimprisonment.  The court granted him the TRO and full custody of his children. In\nOctober 2005, the court directed parenting time for his wife. Applicant and his wife\nagreed to joint custody as part of their divorce agreement. Their divorce became final in\nJune 2006.8\nApplicant retained counsel to represent him in his criminal case. In September\n2005, the court determined that Applicant\u2019s case was a drug referral case. The county\ndrug screener evaluated Applicant, and concluded that Applicant did not need drug\ntreatment. The drug screener recommended a deferred judgment. There are no records\nof this meeting. 9\nApplicant, through his attorney, entered into plea negotiations with the prosecutor\nbecause of his children, career and lack of a criminal history. Applicant wanted to\nproceed to trial to prove his innocence. His attorney recommended against a trial\nbecause of the special offender charge. His attorney viewed a trial as very risky.\nApplicant agreed to a plea agreement whereby he would plead guilty to one count of\nmarijuana cultivation, a felony; the State would dismiss the remaining charges; and a\ndeferred judgment. The State agreed that his records would be sealed at the conclusion\nof the deferred judgment time and he could again own firearms when he completed the\ndeferred judgment time.  \n10\n\nDuring the two years, Applicant did not even have a traffic stop.

In accordance with the terms of\nthe plea agreement, he entered a temporary plea of guilty. In his allocution to the court,\nhe pled guilty to providing expertise in marijuana cultivation. The court deferred\nconviction and judgment for two years. If he did not have any other arrests in the two\nyear period of time, his temporary plea would be withdrawn and the case dismissed. If\nthe police arrested him again, the court would convict him and impose sentence on this\ncharge. The court fined him and directed he perform 24 hours of community service. He\ncompleted all the terms of the deferred sentence.  On January 31, 2008, the court\n11\nwithdrew his guilty plea and dismissed the case. On March 3, 2008, the court directed\nthat his records be sealed.  \n12\n \nApplicant agreed to this plea bargain based on his attorney\u2019s strong\nrecommendation against proceeding to trial. Applicant sought to move forward with his\nlife and needed to be present to raise his children. He did not believe he should leave\nhis children solely in the care of his wife.13\nApplicant admits he used marijuana up to 10 times between 1995 and 2000. He\nlast used marijuana in March 2000. He does not intend to use marijuana in the future,\nas he would set a poor example to his children. He believes use of marijuana is self-\ndestructive behavior.14\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n(c): allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\n\n7\nAs a result of an argument with his wife, the police arrested Applicant and\ncharged him with domestic violence, offenses related to marijuana, false imprisonment,\nharassment, and possession of drug paraphernalia.  At his preliminary hearing, the\nprosecutor formally charged him with marijuana cultivation, special offender and false\nimprisonment. Applicant subsequently entered a temporary plea of guilty to the\nmarijuana cultivation charge. The government has established the above disqualifying\nconditions.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides three conditions that could mitigate security concerns in\nApplicant\u2019s case:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant\u2019s first and only arrest occurred less than three years ago as a direct\nresult of a verbal argument with his wife. Prior to his arrest, he had not been involved\nwith the criminal justice system for any reason. The State chose not to proceed with an\nindictment on several of the charges made by the police. From this, I draw an inference\nthat Applicant did not commit the crimes of domestic violence and harassment.\nHowever, because of the marijuana cultivation charge, the possession of drug\nparaphernalia charge, a lesser crime, may have been included in the more serious\ncharge. Since his first and only arrest in 2005, he has not been arrested by the police\nfor any criminal conduct or traffic violations. When he completed the terms of his\ndeferred judgment three months ago, his temporary guilty plea was withdrawn and the\nmarijuana cultivation case was dismissed. Based on this action by the court, he has no\ncriminal conviction and sentence. His felony guilty plea was never completely\nadjudicated. Applicant is well-educated and works steadily. He is actively involved with\nhis children. The above mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant\u2019s marijuana\ncultivation offense is duplicated in the Guideline H allegation. Because of this\nduplication, I find for Applicant under Guideline J.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement, \u201cUse of\nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\n\n8\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and\n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\nAppellant used marijuana sporadically in college and shortly thereafter. Less than\nthree years ago, the police arrested and charged him with possession of drug\nparaphernalia, marijuana offenses, and the State proceeded forward on a marijuana\ncultivation charge after the police found a large marijuana plant in his basement. The\nabove disqualifying conditions are applicable in this case. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation;\n\n9\nAppellant\u2019s arrest for marijuana cultivation was less than three years ago, when\nhe was 34 years old. His story that he raises garden plants in a dark, locked room in his\nbasement and the marijuana plant found in the basement was a surprise to him is not\ncredible. Rather, his conduct raises concerns that he was cultivating marijuana in his\nbasement as his former spouse alleged, and he plead guilty to in court. He has not\nprovided any corroborating evidence which would show that he, in fact, raises garden\nvegetables and house plants in this room. At the hearing, he credibly testified that he\nhad no future intent to be involved with drugs because he wanted to set a good example\nfor his children and he did not want to be involved in the criminal justice system again.\nThe record contains no evidence that he associates with or has associated with drug\nusers. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b) have some application.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s problems with the\ncriminal justice system began when he asked his wife for a divorce, which led to a\nvehement argument between the two and his arrest for a multitude of criminal offenses.\nThe State decided not to pursue most of the original charges, a decision indicative of\nthe lack of evidence to prove their case. Most troubling is the issue of marijuana\ncultivation. While Applicant denies he was growing marijuana in the basement, I find his\nstory about growing an indoor garden in a locked, darkened room insufficiently credible\nto meet his burden of proof. He was 34 years old when the police arrested him for\nmarijuana cultivation. He was old enough to understand the serious consequences of\nsuch conduct. He learned a difficult lesson as a result of his conduct and has complied\nwith the terms of his plea agreement. He, however, has not accepted responsibility for\nthe presence of marijuana in his home and his knowledge of the same.\n\n10\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug\ninvolvement, although he has mitigated his criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMay 15, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on August 22,\n2005. On October 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on November 26, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on January 29, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on\nFebruary 13, 2008, and the hearing was initially set for March 7, 2008. Because of a\nconflict between Applicant and his counsel, Applicant did not appear at the hearing on\nthat date. A second Notice of Hearing was issued on April 9, 2008, and the hearing\nfinally convened as scheduled on April 21, 2008, in San Diego, California. The\n\n2\nGovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 14, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through C, without\nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until April 28, 2008, to\nsubmit additional matters.  He timely submitted Exhibit D, which has been received and\nentered without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on April 30,\n2008, and the record closed on that date. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 54 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. He received\na Master\u2019s Degree in Physics in 1989.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 8 allegations regarding financial difficulties, 1.a. through 1.h.,\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order\nas they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. In 1997, Applicant petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court for a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy. In 1998 all of his debts were discharged in bankruptcy. His debts\ntotaled $45,877.52 (Exhibit 4). \nApplicant testified that for approximately one year before he filed for bankruptcy\nhe had been unemployed because he had been laid off from his last place of\nemployment. He had also undergone back surgery the year before that, and his medical\nbills totaled approximately $4,700 more than what his insurance would cover.\n1.b. In 1998, Applicant wrote four checks with insufficient funds to cover the\nchecks. Applicant was prosecuted, plead Nolo Contendere, paid restitution, and\nadjudication was withheld.  \nApplicant testified that he wrote these four checks over a period of time, and that\nhe was working at the time he wrote them. While he testified that he thought he would\nbe able to cover these checks, he gave no explanation for why he continued over the\ncourse of several months to write checks that could had insufficient funds to be used,\n\n3\nand why he never resolved the payment of these four checks, until he was ordered by\nthe court to do so. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,245.\nFor a judgement entered against him in 1998. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he\nhas not paid this bill, because the court did not accept a partial payment, but rather\nwanted only a full payment.  While Applicant claims he plans to eventually save\nsufficient funds to make one payment to resolve this bill, he has yet to do so even,\nthough the bill was incurred approximately 10 years ago. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $783.\nApplicant testified that he has been paying on this bill, which had increased to $1,283,\nbecause of interest charges, and he now owes approximately $200 on this debt. The\nrecord was left open to allow Applicant to submit documentation establishing that this\ndebt has been reduced to $200. In the post hearing documents, dated December 17,\n2007, and submitted by Applicant in Exhibit D, it shows that $30 was distributed to this\ncreditor by a consumer credit counseling service, used by Applicant. Since only one\nstatement was submitted, I can not conclude that consistent monthly payments are\nbeing made and this debt is in the process of being resolved. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $12,371.\nApplicant testified that this debt is for an auto loan upon which he defaulted, when he\nbecame unemployed. He claims that he has been making payment on this debt and that\nthe outstanding debt now totals approximately $11,000. The record was left open to\nallow Applicant to submit documentation establishing that this debt has been reduced to\n$11,000. In Exhibit D, it shows that $248 was distributed to this creditor by a consumer\ncredit counseling service, used by Applicant. Since only one statement was submitted, I\ncan not conclude that consistent monthly payments are being made and this debt is in\nthe process of being resolved. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $402.\nApplicant was not certain if anything had been paid on this debt. In Exhibit D, it shows\nthat $15 was distributed to this creditor by a consumer credit counseling service, used\nby Applicant. Since only one statement was submitted, I can not conclude that\nconsistent monthly payments are being made and this debt is in the process of being\nresolved. \n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $926.\nThe creditor of this debt is listed as the same as 1.f., above. In Exhibit D, it shows that\n$19 was distributed to this creditor by a consumer credit counseling service used by\nApplicant. Since only one statement was submitted, I can not conclude that consistent\nmonthly payments are being made and this debt is in the process of being resolved. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $376. In\nExhibit D, it shows that $15 was distributed to this creditor by a consumer credit\ncounseling service, used by Applicant. Since only one statement was submitted, I can\n\n4\nnot conclude that consistent monthly payments are being made and this debt is in the\nprocess of being resolved. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe SOR lists 7 allegations, 2.a. through 2.g., regarding criminal conduct under\nAdjudicative Guideline J. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as\nthey were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. In 1993, Applicant was charged with No license on Person, and he was\nfined. At the hearing, Applicant denied this allegation, as he had no recollection of ever\nbeing charged with not having a license in the city that is alleged in the SOR. \n1.b. In February 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under\nthe Influence (DUI). Applicant plead No Contest, and he was sentenced to one year\nprobation, six months suspended driver\u2019s license, fined $850, and ordered to participate\nin community service and DUI school. Applicant testified that this allegation is correct,\nand that he did meet all of his obligations for this sentence.  \n \n1.c.  In June 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While\nLicense Suspended or Revoked. Applicant plead No Contest, and he was sentenced to\nserve ten days in jail, pay a fine and one year probation. Applicant testified that at the\ntime he was stopped, he was entitled to have his license reinstated, but he had not yet\ngotten around to it. He knew that he was required to have his license reinstated before\nhe was legally entitled to drive, but he simply chose to drive without a reinstated license.\n \n1.d. In February 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. In April\n2000, Applicant was further charged with Failure to Appear. He was sentenced to serve\n60 days in jail, one year probation, and his license was suspended for five years.\nApplicant testified that he was aware of his requirement to appear in court, but since he\nhad traveled out of state, he called the court to ask to have the appearance continued.\nHowever, he could not reach the court, and he simply did not appear when scheduled. \n1.e.  In August 2003, Applicant was charged with (1) Operating a Motor Vehicle\nwith an Expired Vehicle License, and (2) Operating a Motor Vehicle without Insurance.\nHe was fined $45 for Charge (1).  Applicant testified that the vehicle that he was driving\nwas owned by his father, but as the driver he was responsible. Ultimately this was\ncorrected.  \n1.f.  In July 2005, Applicant was charged with Theft. In August 2005, a warrant\nwas issued for Applicant\u2019s arrest for failure to appear. Applicant entered a pretrial\ndiversion program, in which Applicant was ordered to perform community service.\nApplicant testified that he and one of his brothers were driving when they saw some\nwire, whish they believed to be abandoned. His brother put the wire in the back of their\ntruck and they drove off. Ultimately it was reported to the police and the owner of the\nwire pressed charges. Applicant did not receive the initial notice to appear in court\nbecause he was not at the address he gave to the court. When he became aware of his\n\n5\nrequirement, he appeared in court, and he was ordered to perform eight hours of\ncommunity service for the Special Olympics. After his service the charges were\ndismissed. \n1.g.  It is also alleged in the SOR that Applicant\u2019s conduct that is the subject of\nparagraph 1.b., above is also criminal conduct under Guideline J. This involves the four\nchecks written by Applicant with insufficient funds that were never paid by Applicant\nuntil the matter was resolved in court. \nApplicant introduced a letter of recommendation from a Senior Scientist, who has\nknown Applicant for a considerable period of time. He stated that he considers Applicant\nto be a \u201csuperior employee of high moral character\u201d and he \u201cunhesitatingly\nrecommended him\u201d on that basis. There is no indication that this individual is aware of\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties or his criminal conduct.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s long history of not meeting financial\nobligations and his inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts. \nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies as Applicant has failed to\nresolve the vast majority of long overdue debts. While he has contacted a credit\ncounseling service, he produced only one document, dated January 2008, to show that\npayment has been made on these overdue debts. No additional documents were\noffered into evidence to establish that further payments had been made. Therefore, I\ncan not conclude that Applicant has engaged in a systematic effort to resolve his\noverdue debts. I, therefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged\nin criminal conduct, as he was arrested for, and convicted of criminal offenses including:\nwriting four checks with insufficient funds in 1998, two incidences of DUI in 1999 and\n2000, failing to appear for his DUI court appearance in 2000 with no legitimate reason,\nknowingly driving with a suspended license in 1999, and an arrest for theft for placing\nwire in his vehicle that he knew or should have known belonged to someone else in\n2005. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. Under Mitigation\nConditions (MC), I can not find that MC 32. (d) applies to this Applicant, as there is no\n\n7\nevidence of successful rehabilitation because the last criminal conduct occurred in\n2005, only three years ago, and there is a significant pattern of criminal conduct.\nApplicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and G, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties, his failure to resolve the overdue debts, and his history of criminal conduct, I\nfind that the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g.: \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

WESLEY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nChester (Skip) Morgan, II, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of demonstrated judgment lapses associated with his use of classified\ncomputer systems and related software in his work and in his use of accessing adult pornographic\nmaterials and engaging in sex-related conduct in public areas.  Applicant\u2019s collective actions resulted\nin the denial of his requested access to sensitive comparted information (SCI).   Similar conclusions\nare warranted here  under the personal conduct guideline based on Applicant\u2019s demonstrated pattern\nof poor judgment in a number of areas and circumstances.  Applicant\u2019s collective actions represent\noverall  poor judgment that is for the most part still too recent to mitigate.  Only Applicant\u2019s past\naccess of adult pornographic material on his office computer and his related engaging in sexual\nmisconduct is sufficiently isolated and dated to be successfully mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn June 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 29, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on August 3, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on September 11, 2007.  A hearing\nwas held on September 11, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of seven exhibits; Applicant relied on two\nwitnesses (including himself) and three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on September\n19, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record by kept open to afford him\nthe opportunity to supplement the record with documented proof of the curriculum materials he was\nprovided at a parenting course he attended 2004 following his NSA interviews.  There being no\nobjection from the Government, and good cause being demonstrated, Applicant was granted seven\ndays to supplement the record.  The Government was afforded three days to respond.  Within the\ntime permitted, Applicant provided documentation of the curriculum materials provided him in his\nparenting course.  The submission was admitted as exhibit  D.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have been denied eligibility to access secret\ncompartmented information (SC) by another government agency in May 2004 based on information\nthat he (1) modified a line of programming on a classified computer (between 2001 and 2003) as a\nprank so that a co-worker\u2019s computer would beep at start-up; (2) accessed a classified computer\nnetwork at a U.S. government facility abroad on three separate occasions without authorization; (3)\naccessed a U.S. government facility\u2019s e-mails from the account of a co-worker (not logged off at the\ntime) while working at a facility abroad; (4) inadvertently carried classified computer disks in his\nbriefcase in either 1992 or 1993 from one classified facility to another; (5) viewed adult pornography\non his office computer and masturbated in his office and in the company restroom, for two hours a\nday on average between 1995 and 1996; masturbated while driving his vehicle to and from work\nthree times a year prior to about May 2003; (6) used a chastisement device to discipline his children\nbetween 1997 and 2004 that left bruises on his children\u2019s legs; and (7) continued working on a\nsecure security system after being notified in October 2003 that he was no longer authorized to\naccess this system.  \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to modifying a line of programming on a\nclassified computer system, but denied any exercise of questionable judgment.   Applicant admitted\n\n3\nsending one or two e-mails from the account of a co-worker while working at a U.S. facility abroad.\nApplicant also admitted to working on a computer system without authorization in 2003, but only\non few occasions.  Applicant denied the remaining allegations: some en totale, and others in part,\nand added explanations.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a  43-year-old software developer who seeks a security clearance. The\nallegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nWhile employed as a contractor for another agency (NSA) between 2001 and 2003, Applicant\nwas twice granted conditional certification of access (CCA) in 2003 to access SCI.  He was first\ngranted access in March 2003 and then debriefed after his employer withdrew his sponsorship in\nJune 2003 (see ex. 3).   Following his employment by a new employer in July 2003 (O corporation),\nthis employer successfully sponsored him for CCA.  His CCA was rescinded, though, in February\n2004 when he was unable to successfully complete his security processing.\nApplicant was interviewed by an NSA investigator in October 2003 as a part of the agency\u2019s\nbackground investigation to determine his suitability to access SCI (ex. 4).  During this interview,\nhe disclosed computer-related information that NSA interpreted to entail security violations, sexual\nmisbehavior, and abusive child disciplining (see exs. 4 and 5).  \nIn or about 1992 or 1993, Applicant inadvertently carried classified unused computer disks\nin his briefcase from one classified facility to another on multiple occasions.  According to\nApplicant, these disks had never been used in a classified system: \u201cThey were just blank floppy\ndisks,\u201d according to Applicant (R.T., at 38).  However, Applicant did not expressly  retract his\nstatements given to an NSA investigator in October 2003 when asked about the disks by Department\nCounsel (R.T., at 72-75).  In this interview, Applicant, acknowledged, carrying secret level computer\ndisks in his briefcase from one DoD secret facility to another, discovering them on his return to the\nfacility\u2019s unclassified location, and then taking steps to ensure the disks were properly secured in the\nproper classified facility by the close of business (see ex. 4).  With the clarification that the disks in\nquestion were unused blank floppy disks, Applicant\u2019s statements made to the NSA investigator in\nOctober 2003 about these disks are accepted and incorporated anew.\nWhile working for at a U.S. Government facility in Australia (between 1997 and 2001),\nApplicant remotely logged into a classified TS/SCI level network in Great Britain in an effort to\nresolve software problems, or other errors he was experiencing with the network in Australia (see\nexs. 3 and 4).  After successfully logging in, he accessed the director of systems logs and proceeded\nto analyze the logs.  He recollected taking these actions on three separate occasions during this 1997-\n2001 time period without obtaining authorization (R.T., at 71).  He subsequently acknowledged this\nwas likely incorrect action, since he was not authorized.  Applicant assured that he never attempted\nto \u201ccrack\u201d passwords on another user\u2019s system.  Nor was it necessary to surreptitiously enter the\nother user\u2019s system, inasmuch, as he had not logged off of his system or engaged his screen saver\nduring Applicant\u2019s interventions.\n\n4\nDuring his period of employment in Australia, Applicant also recollects sending one or two\ne-mails from the account of a co-worker who had not yet logged off her own computer.  Applicant\nensures he meant no harm by his intrusive actions and only intended the activity as a prank (see exs.\n3 and 4).\nWhile working for a prior defense contractor for a period in 2001, Applicant encountered a\nspecific office need for system administrator access to modify a line of programming on a classified\nnetwork (see exs. 3 and 7).  On this particular occasion during this 2001 time frame, Applicant  used\nhis own system administrator privileges to gain access to a female co-worker\u2019s system profile.  The\nmodification caused his coworker\u2019s computer to beep at start-up; it was intended as a prank, and\napparently did not cause any disruption in the network (see ex. 4; R.T., at 62-63).  Applicant\nacknowledged, though, that \u201che was not supposed to access other people\u2019s e-mail\u201d (R.T., at 72).\nFollowing his employment as a NSA contractor in September 2003, Applicant began working\nin NSA facilities (see ex. 5).  Shortly after his start-up with NSA, he was given root access\npasswords to the secure computer system in his office to facilitate his performing his assigned system\nadministrator duties.  Unbeknownst to him at the time, his supervisors had submitted his name for\nprivileged access to classified information (PRIVAC).  In October 2003, he was notified that he was\ndenied PRIVAC and could no longer work on classified systems.  After being told he did not have\nPRIVAC and couldn\u2019t administer classified systems without it,  he continued performing his system\nadministrator duties without supervision three times a week (see ex. 5; R.T., at 64-65, 86-87).  Two\nmonths later (in December  2003), Applicant discontinued his unsupervised access to his classified\ncomputer system.  By this time he had been notified of a scheduled second interview and polygraph\nexamination with NSA and knew that gaining access to NSA\u2019s classified computer system without\nPRIVAC was against NSA policy.  Knowing that he would likely be asked about his continued\nworking on the classified computer without PRIVAC would likely be explored in the scheduled\ninterview and polygraph, he ceased his unauthorized access (see ex. 5; R.T., at 88). \nOver a two-year period between 1995 and 1996, Applicant viewed adult pornography on his\nunclassified office computer, in addition to masturbating in his office three to ten times and in the\ncompany restroom on three to ten occasions (never completely shielded from potential public\nobservation).  He estimates that on average he viewed pornography in his office computer for two\nhours per work day, and at times, as much as four hours per workday (see exs. 3 and 4; R.T., at 76-\n80).  It is not clear whether there were specific guidelines in place with his employer at the time that\nproscribed deliberate accessing of pornography on an office computer (compare exs. 3 and 7).\nNonetheless, the NSA\u2019s SCI findings reflect drawn inferences that it was at the very least  a\ndisfavored company practice.  During this same contemporaneous period, and for a number of years\nthereafter, he occasionally masturbated while driving his vehicle to and from work.  His last reported\nact of masturbation while driving was in May 2003 (exs. 3 and 4; R.T., at 79).  Applicant insists he\nnever had any fear of detection or repercussions at work over the conduct (R.T., at 81).\nFor over seven years spanning 1997 and 2004, Applicant used a 12-inch cloth-covered ruler\nknown as a \u201cchastisement device\u201d (a device designed to change a child\u2019s behavior by means of\nadministering corporal punishment) to discipline his  children.  He was introduced to this practice\nthrough a course that consisted of meeting with other couples, exchanging ideas, and watching two\nvideos on child rearing that were produced by an identified Christian organization (see ex. A; R.T.,\nat 50-51).  He purchased the chastisement device from his course hosts (R.T., at 52).  When first\n\n5\ninterviewed by NSA in October 2003, he described his chastisement practice in which a child is\n\u201cswatted a number of times equivalent to their age plus an additional one to two times\u201d (ex. 4).\nDescribing his practice as one that is done \u201ceffectively and lovingly,\u201d he acknowledged that he\n\u201cswatted his daughter too many times and two hard,\u201d which resulted in bruises on his daughter\u2019s leg\n(ex. 4).  He admitted to causing  bruises on his daughter\u2019s legs once or twice, while making every\neffort to avoid applying the chastisement device on his children\u2019s bare posterior.  Applicant also\nacknowledged his use of the chastisement device on his younger son once daily, which he attributed\nto his son\u2019s need for daily disciplining (see ex. 4).\nIn a second interview with NASA (in January 2004), Applicant elaborated some on his use\nof the chastisement device.  He traced his initiation of chastising his children to very early ages and\nclassified his use frequency of the device on his children as \u201cregular\u201d (see ex. 5).  He acknowledged\nfor the first time to unintentionally leaving bruises on the backs of his children on a few occasions\n(possibly once a year) when the disciplined child moved during his striking action.  He stated in this\ninterview that he last left a bruise on his youngest son in 2003 (see ex. 5).  Applicant indicated he\nhad never been questioned by authorities over the manner in which he disciplined his children and\nbelieved his actions were not excessive.\nApplicant spoke in greater depth and detail about his chastising of his children in his third\nand last interview with NSA in March 2004 (see ex. 6).  In this interview, he confirmed his\nchastising his four-year old daughter two to three times per week for \u201cpushing her six-year brother\u2019s\nbuttons\u201d (ex. 6).  He reaffirmed his chastising his younger son on a daily basis between 2000 and\nearly 2004, and thereafter three to four times a week for bullying his four-year-old sister and lying\n(an automatic reason for chastising).  He indicated that his chastising of his other two daughters\nvaried: from no chastising for the past year with his nine-year old daughter to once a month\nchastising of his oldest daughter for exhibiting a bad attitude and \u201csaying mean things\u201d to her\nsiblings (ex. 6).  Applicant repeated his leaving inadvertent bruises on his children once a year\nbetween the years 1997 and 2004 and to occasionally striking the backs of their legs when any of the\nchildren moved while he was administering the chastise device.  At hearing, he insisted he had no\nintention to bruise or harm his children with his chastising actions.\nAfter talking with co-workers following his March 2004 NSA interview,  Applicant enrolled\nin a parenting course in April 2004 (see exs. 7 and D; R.T., at 59).  This class was administered by\na state department of social services, was entitled \u201cDads works\u201d (ex. 7), and involved weekly\nsessions with fathers seeking to learn about parenting skills (R.T., at 59).   From this parenting\ncourse, he gained fresh tools and ideas for non-physical punishment of his children and, thereafter\nthrew the chastise device away.  Since taking his parenting course, Applicant insists he has not used\na chastisement device to discipline his children (R.T., at 59-60).\nBased on all of the information compiled from NSA interviews covering Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity-related activities and his personal practices involving his personal behavior over a 12-year\nperiod, NSA denied Applicant access to SCI in May 2004 (ex. 3).  After weighing all of the available\ninformation necessary to make an informed whole person assessment, NSA determined that\nApplicant did not meet the DCID 6/4 standards for access to NSA/CSS SCI (see ex. 3).  Applicant\nelected not to appeal NSA\u2019s eligibility denial for SCI access (R.T., at 88).\n\n6\nApplicant was interviewed by OPM in December 2006 in connection with his application\nfor a collateral clearance (see ex. 7).   The interview covered the same areas of inquiry developed\nby NSA during its SCI investigation, and entailed considerable qualifications and minimizing of the\nactions he acknowledged in previous NSA interviews.  For instance, when he was asked about his\ncontinued use of a classified computer system without oversight in 2003 after being advised he did\nnot have PRIVAC, he indicated he did so only after he could not find a team member with PRIVAC,\nand used the computer system for the limited purpose of repairing system errors.  Asked to address\nhis prior chastising of his children in this OPM interview (see ex. 7), he retreated on his previous\nacknowledgments made to NSA interviewers.  In this interview, he assured that he did not use the\nchastise device often and always applied it over the child\u2019s clothes, \u201cnever against bare skin\u201d (ex.\n7).  Further, he indicated \u201cthe children were not bruised due to the use of the chastise belt\u201d (see ex.\n7).  Applicant indicated he did not enjoy disciplining his children with \u201cthe chastise belt\u201d (ex. 7).\nAsked at hearing about bruising his children with his chastisement device, Applicant did\nrecall one possible inadvertent experience with his younger son (R.T., at 56-57), but otherwise\ndenied ever inflicting any bruises on his children from his chastising.  Applicant did admit to one\ninstance of intentionally striking  his youngest daughter on her bare skin while she was bathing (R.T.,\nat 57).\nIn his 2006 OPM interview, the OPM investigator also explored Applicant\u2019s previously\nacknowledged viewing of adult  pornographic material on his office computer.  For the first time he\nrecounted a cause and effect association between his viewing of pornographic material and his\nwithdrawing to his employer\u2019s restroom to masturbate (see ex. 7).  At the same time, he trimmed\nhis previously admitted admissions of masturbating while driving: in this interview; in this interview,\nhe admitted  to just one instance of masturbating while driving (ex. 7).  \nApplicant\u2019s  FSO and project manager together credit Applicant with avoiding any security\nviolations and incidents between August  2004 and April 2007 (see exs. B and C).  Applicant is well\nregarded by a coworker familiar with him.  This coworker describes Applicant as honest and\ntrustworthy and one who possesses a high sensitivity to guilt (R.T., at 26-27).   \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\n\n7\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\nsecurity clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAppellant comes to these proceedings as a software developer who acknowledged security-\nrelated actions over a 10-year period that were neither authorized nor incidents that could be fairly\ndetermined to fall within his established parameters of responsible authority.  While none of these\nspecific actions admitted to in NSA interviews associated with his 2003 SCI application were ever\ninvestigated and found to reflect security violations meriting disciplinary actions, the cumulative\neffect of these repeated actions over an extensive period of time raise security issues.  Although none\nof Applicant\u2019s cited irregularities with his computer or classified disks carried in his briefcase\ninvolved stored classified information, his actions certainly raised questions about his judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness required for eligibility to access classified information.\nRecurrent failures to adhere to established security procedures\n\n8\nUnder the Directive\u2019s security violation guidelines in force, persons responsible for\nsafeguarding classified information in their custody and control are required to adhere to established\nprocedural requirements for operating classified computer systems and safeguarding classified disks,\nand to avoid actions that might place classified information under their custody and control at risk\nto compromise.  Applicant\u2019s continued access to a classified computer system with the knowledge\nof being denied PRIVAC and his deliberate mishandling of his classified computer systems under\nhis control (even for prank reasons) violated the procedural requirements of paragraph 5-100 of the\nNISPOM for accessing classified network systems without authorization.  His actions warrant  one\nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct: DC 16 (c)\n(credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information).\nThe importance of demonstrating sound judgment and willingness to comply with established\nrules and guidelines regarding the administering of classified equipment and safeguarding classified\ncomputer hardware and software cannot be overemphasized.  Protecting the nation\u2019s security\ninterests against the risks of foreign coercion and intimidation remains a core governmental\nresponsibility that finds roots in our earliest Constitutional  history  and enjoys the sustaining force\nof the courts.  Cf. United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319-20 (1936). Applicant's\ncontinued accessing of a classified computer system after being advised he did not have PRIVAC,\nhis failures to utilize his employer\u2019s trusted authorization procedures for accessing other computer\nsystems, his misuse of a classified computer to cause a beep on a co-worker\u2019s computer start-up, and\nhis carrying classified disks (even empty ones) to and from classified facilities in his briefcase over\nan extended time period increased the security risks for potential compromise of classified\ninformation.  His actions, as such, reflect adversely on his judgment and trustworthiness for\naccessing classified information. \nIn appraising the security significance of Applicant's history of misuse of classified computer\nsystems and software (i.e., the empty classified disks), some deliberate and some inadvertent,  careful\nconsideration was given to Applicant's full and open disclosure of his actions in the NSA interviews\nthat preceded his denial of SCI access in 2004.  While all of the developed information was based\non Applicant\u2019s open disclosures to NSA interviewers, and not from any other developed sources, the\ninformation does reflect judgment lapses by an experienced software developer that are security\nsignificant.  While Applicant has since minimized some of the events he recounted to NSA\ninterviewers, the findings made in NSA\u2019s 2004 decision covering Applicant\u2019s application to access\nSCI is well supported by information furnished by Applicant in a series of NSA interviews and was\nnever appealed by Applicant.  Despite his efforts to further explain and to some extent minimize the\nevents covered in NSA\u2019s 2004 decision, the findings are credibly based and are sustained.\nBecause the developed infractions of company procedures governing the administering of\nclassified computer systems and software are derived from the guideline governing personal conduct,\nand not the guideline covering security violations, these infractions must be assessed against the\nbackdrop of both the mitigating conditions of the new Adjudicative Guidelines and a whole person\nassessment.   While a number of years have passed since the last reported infraction (in 2003), the\nactions themselves cannot be considered minor, infrequent, or aged, when considered as a whole,\n\n9\nand not in piecemeal.  To be sure, any of these actions considered alone or in isolation could  likely\nbe mitigated, especially given his more recent clean record.  It is their confluence that creates current\nsecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s demonstrated  judgment.  Given the circumstances in which these\nincidents were elicited (viz., against the backdrop of a scheduled polygraph) and the absence of\ndocumented counseling and/or specific restorative initiatives (such as additional briefings on\nprocedures for administering classified systems) to ensure his avoidance of recurrent incidents in the\nfuture, potential mitigation conditions under the personal conduct guideline are not available to\nApplicant.  Without the benefit of applicable mitigating conditions to the covered conduct,\nsuccessful mitigation is more difficult to demonstrate herein under the Guideline E guideline. \nEvaluating Applicant\u2019s actions from a whole person perspective does not warrant any more\nfavorable conclusions either.  Even with credit accorded for his completing security training and\navoiding any adverse incidents over the past three plus years, the covered incidents are too numerous\nand serious when considered together to warrant the application of  any of the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline E in this proceeding.  Collectively, these covered classified computer and software-\nrelated actions reflect a security significant pattern of judgment lapses that is too extensive and recent\nto be mitigated at this time under any of the cited mitigation conditions under the personal conduct\nguideline.\nApplicant\u2019s other covered conduct\nPattern misconduct attributable to Applicant also includes his regular viewing of adult\npornography on his office computer during a two-year period spanning 1995 and 1996 and his\nengaging in masturbation in his office, in the company\u2019s restroom, and while driving during this\nsame contemporaneous period, and thereafter when driving his car (i.e., to May 2003).  Applicant\u2019s\nregular disciplining of his four young children through the corporal application of a chastisement\ndevice to their posteriors, and occasionally to their exposed legs and backs, over the course of seven\nyears spanning 1997 and 2004, was confirmed by NSA in its 2004 SCI access decision and was\nnever challenged by Applicant.  Applicant\u2019s  acknowledged sexual misconduct and  harsh treatment\nof his children (some of which resulted in bruises and red marks on his  children), reflect poorly on\nhis respect for his office rules and internal guidelines and his children\u2019s well being and represent still\nadditional examples of demonstrated poor judgment.\nAside from the physical bruises and red marks occasionally inflicted on his children, regular\napplication of pain producing blunt instruments on children so young risks damaging their fragile\nesteem systems during their early development and exposes these children to potentially irreversible\ndevelopmental deficits.  It is not at all clear that Applicant considered these risks before settling on\nthe discipline practice he chose after viewing a child rearing video with his hosts.  His regular use\nof a chastisement device on his children in the way he recounted on multiple occasions to NSA\ninvestigators does cast reasonable doubt on his judgment and trustworthiness and his overall ability\nto demonstrate his current eligibility to access classified information.\nLike his  computer-related conduct, Applicant\u2019s pornography and sexual based actions are\nnot based on any specific guideline tailored to the specific conduct, but rather on the personal\nconduct guideline that covers acts indicative of poor judgment and unreliability.  Specifically, this\nconduct is covered by DC 16(c) of the Adjudication Guidelines for personal conduct.  Whether\nApplicant\u2019s collective actions can be mitigated due to age, infrequency, and/or unique circumstances\n\n10\nthat are unlikely to recur cannot be resolved solely based solely on the application of any of the\nmitigating conditions. \nBoth Applicant\u2019s disciplining practices and his less recent accessing of pornography on his\noffice computer and engaging in masturbating in public areas over a prolonged period preclude the\napplication of the conjunctive provisions of MC 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) of the guidelines for\npersonal conduct.  Based on the counseling he initiated to reassess his disciplining of his children,\nhe may take very limited application of two of the other mitigating conditions: specifically, MC\n17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur).\nand MC 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress).  Applicant\u2019s counseling efforts and corrective steps he has\ntaken in disciplining his children, while encouraging, are still too recent and uncertain, however, to\naccord considerable weight. \nRecognizing that security clearance evaluations do not represent an exact science, some\nwhole person assessments are necessary to supplement the specific requirements of the relevant\nmitigating conditions of the personal conduct guideline.  Applicant\u2019s accessing of pornography and\nrelated masturbation in public areas (inclusive of his office and while driving on public highways)\nis now quite dated for the most part (primarily in the 1995-1996 time frame), and has not been\nrepeated since his last reported incident of masturbating while driving in 2003.  Even though the\njudgment lapses implicit in this acknowledged behavior reflect part of a pattern of judgment lapses\nmanifesting in different areas and circumstances, this activity has unique characteristics and is one\nthat can be fairly evaluated separately without turning the evaluation into a unsustainable piecemeal\nassessment.  So, although application of the mitigating conditions may not be fully available to\nApplicant, without ignoring Applicant\u2019s history of serious indiscretions in other areas of the record,\nwhole person assessment in these unique circumstances makes it highly unlikely that Applicant will\never again engage in any of these sex-related activities. \nLess amenable to mitigation through either the mitigating conditions of the personal conduct\nguideline or a whole person assessment is Applicant\u2019s self-reported disciplinary use of a\nchastisement device on his children.  To Applicant\u2019s credit, he took advantage of a parenting course\nfollowing his last NSA interview.  Whether his parenting course has resulted in permanent\nbehavioral changes in Applicant is still uncertain at this point in time.  Applicant provided no\ndocumentation of his course progress, his completion of the course, or what he learned from the\ncourse.  His most recent OPM interview reflects some continuing denial of the ramifications of his\nregular use of the discipline practice on his young children and complicates the process of making\npredictive judgments about whether he can be expected to avoid recurrent use of the chastisement\ndevice in the future.   Unlike his accessing pornography and employment of sexual relief actions in\npublic places, his harsh disciplining actions are generally more recent and more likely to generate\nlong term repercussions on the child recipients.\nIn balance, Applicant can safely be credited with mitigation of security concerns associated\nwith his use of poor judgment in accessing pornography and engaging in masturbation in public\n\n11\nplaces and areas.  More time is needed, however, to make fair and reasonable predictable\nassessments about his abstaining from inflicting the kind of corporal punishment on his children that\nhe acknowledged to NSA investigators in 2003 and 2004.  While Applicant is to be encouraged by\nhis accounts of changing his disciplining practices since taking his parenting course, it is still too\nsoon to mitigate the judgment lapses associated with his past actions.  So, while favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the poor judgment allegations associated with his access of\npornography on his office computer and his related engagement in sexually oriented activity in\npublic areas, unfavorable conclusions are warranted with respect to the judgment allegations\ncovering his disciplinary practices.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E2\n2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, I make\nthe following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a (numbers 1 through 5, 7 & 8): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a (number 6):\nFOR APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Thomas M. Abbott, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn May 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline C, \nForeign Preference and Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 2, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another Administrative \nJudge on November 1, 2007, and reassigned to me on November 28, 2007. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on November 28, 2007, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on December 18, 2007, at Woodland Hills, California. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 10, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nFebruary 12, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nStipulation \n \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant stipulated to the admissibility of government \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and Applicant exhibits (AE) A through V, and the exhibits \nwere admitted. The stipulation was marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) XII.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object. The request and the \nattached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as \nHE I through XI. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, \nbelow.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He was born in Iran. \nApplicant came to the United States when he was in his early 20s to attend college. He \nhas a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master\u2019s degree from American universities. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 1980. He has held a security clearance for about 20 \nyears without incident.1 \n \n \nWhen he was a young man, Applicant served his mandatory two years in the \nIranian military under the Shah\u2019s regime, when Iran was an ally of the United States. He \ncame to the U.S. after his military commitment to attend college. He met and married \nhis wife while in college. They have been married for more than 30 years. His wife is a \nnative born U.S. citizen. They have a 29-year-old son born in the United States while \nApplicant was at graduate school. He is also an engineer and has worked for the same \ncompany as Applicant and holds a security clearance. He does not speak Farsi, and \nhas never been to Iran.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in Iran in the early 1990s. His mother is in her \nlate 70s. She has never worked outside the home. She is an Iranian citizen but has U.S. \npermanent residence status. For about the last 20 years she has split her time between \nthe U.S. and Iran. She is presently living in Iran. Her last stay in the U.S. was in 2006. \nShe lives in a condominium in Iran close to two of Applicant\u2019s sisters. She receives a \npension from the company in Iran that Applicant\u2019s father worked for before he retired.3  \n \n \nApplicant was one of ten children. Eight of his brothers and sisters are still alive. \nFive of his siblings are living in the U.S. They and their families are all U.S. citizens.  \nApplicant has three sisters who remain as citizens and residents of Iran. His oldest \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 13-16, 45-47, 68; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n2 Tr. at 23-27, 44-47; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 27-30, 35, 41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nsister is in her early 60s. She does not work outside the home. Her husband is retired. \nThey have four children; three still live in Iran. One child lives in a country that is a U.S. \nally. Applicant has periodic telephonic communication with this sister. He does not \nprovide her any financial support. She has never visited Applicant in the U.S.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second sister living in Iran is in her mid-40s. Her husband works for a \nprivate company. She does not work. They have two children.  His third sister in Iran is \nin her early 40s. Her husband is retired from a private company. They have three \nchildren. Applicant communicates with these two sisters about two to three times a year. \nHe does not provide financial support to either of these sisters. Neither of these sisters \nhave ever met or spoken with Applicant\u2019s son. They do not speak English and he does \nnot speak Farsi.5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sisters in Iran do not know what he does for a living or \nthat he has a security clearance. No one in Applicant\u2019s family has ever worked directly \nfor the Iranian government or has any connection to any terrorist organization.6  \n \n \nApplicant has returned to Iran on four occasions since he first came to the U.S. \nHis first return was in the 1970s when his brother died. His next trip to Iran was in the \nearly 1990s when his father passed away. Applicant was working for a defense \ncontractor holding a security clearance at the time. His travel to Iran was discussed at \nthe highest level of his company. He was told to speak with the State Department. \nApplicant was visited by a State Department representative. He was briefed for about \ntwo and a half hours. Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport was long expired at that point. He \nwas instructed to obtain an Iranian passport and was told not to carry his U.S passport \nto Iran. He was given instructions on what to say if asked where he works. He was \ngiven a letter and instructions to travel to Iran via an allied country. Applicant was met \nupon arrival at the allied country by a representative of that country and he provided the \nrepresentative with the letter from the State Department. The representative held \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. passport while he traveled to Iran. No one in Iran showed any special \ninterest in Applicant. When Applicant returned from Iran, he again flew through the \nsame allied country. He was again met at the airport by representatives of that country \nwho returned his U.S. passport.7 \n \n \nAs the oldest son, Applicant inherited his father\u2019s property. He returned to Iran \nabout one year after his father died and signed everything over to his mother. Security \npersonnel from his company made the same arrangements for Applicant to travel \nthrough the allied country, leaving his U.S. passport with personnel from the allied \ngovernment until he returned. He again attracted no special interest.8  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 30-35; GE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 35-41; GE 1, 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 41-42; 70. \n \n7 Tr. at 48-54. \n \n8 Tr. at 54-56. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last visit to Iran was in the early 2000s. His wife had never met his \nsisters or seen his country of origin and wanted to visit. He consulted with his security \npersonnel. He was told that he should obtain another Iranian passport as the last one \nexpired. His wife obtained an Iranian passport as the wife of an Iranian citizen. They \nagain flew through the allied country but were not met by representatives of that \ncountry.9 \n \nWhen Applicant discovered that possession of a foreign passport was a security \nconcern, he surrendered his Iranian passport to his company\u2019s security officer in July \n2007. The security officer destroyed the passport. Applicant does not intend to renew or \nobtain another Iranian passport under any circumstance. He has decided that he will not \nreturn to Iran. His mother may return to the U.S. to live. He has resigned himself to the \nfact that he will not be able to visit his mother if she becomes sick in Iran and he will not \nreturn to Iran if she dies there. He does not consider himself a dual citizen. To the \nextent that Iran considers him an Iranian citizen, he would be more than willing to \nrenounce his Iranian citizenship.10  \n \nApplicant does not have any Iranian assets. His U.S. assets are worth well over \n$1,000,000. He votes in U.S. elections and has never voted in an Iranian election. He is \ninvolved in community and charitable events.11 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted numerous character letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nHe is described as a man of integrity, honest, trustworthy, truthful, hard-working, \ntalented, dedicated, professional, responsible, strong-willed, independent, and not \nsomeone who could be easily manipulated. They believe he is a loyal, proud, U.S. \ncitizen who should be granted a security clearance. One reference stated he would trust \nhis life to Applicant. Another stated he trusted his son to Applicant by naming him the \nchild\u2019s godfather. Applicant has been regularly promoted in his company to a high \nexecutive level position and supervises more than 1,000 employees. He is very highly \nregarded and considered a valuable asset. He has received excellent performance \nevaluation and various awards and accolades.12 \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d The U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 56-59. \n \n10 Tr. at 59-60, 68-69, 79-80; AE A. \n \n11 Tr. at 47, 61-63; AE N-U. \n \n12 AE A-K, M. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n\u2022 Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD);  \n\u2022 Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n\u2022 Its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and \n\u2022 Its dismal human rights record. \n \nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq is also a concern. \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor \nof terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. \n \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens\u2014even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian- \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \nApplicant possessed and used an Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 \n10(a) applied at one point. The renewal of his Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen could \nraise concerns under AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain recognition of his Iranian \ncitizenship. Applicant\u2019s mandatory service in the Iranian military before he became a \nU.S. citizen does not raise any disqualifying condition.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and, \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nIran continued to consider Applicant an Iranian citizen after he was naturalized as \na U.S. citizen. He followed the advice of security personnel and the U.S. State \nDepartment and renewed his Iranian passport to travel to Iran twice in the early 1990s, \nand again in the early 2000s. His use of the Iranian passport was at the \nrecommendation of the U.S. State Department.  He does not consider himself a dual \nnational, but to the extent that Iran considers him an Iranian citizen, he is very willing to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrenounce that citizenship. When he became aware that the passport was a security \nconcern, he surrendered it to his company\u2019s security officer who destroyed it. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign military service occurred before he became a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 \n11(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) are applicable. AG \u00b6 11(d) is at least \npartially applicable. AG \u00b6 11(c) would be applicable if it was necessary to mitigate \nApplicant\u2019s foreign military service. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), Acontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion@ is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 7(b), Aconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation@ may raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s mother and three sisters are in \nIran, a country that is clearly hostile to the United States.13 It is considered the most \nactive state sponsor of terrorism, and the government of Iran has committed numerous, \nserious human rights abuses against its people. Applicant\u2019s family in Iran creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nIt also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by the \nevidence. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \n                                                          \n13 ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); HE I-XI. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and, \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant came to the U.S. as a young man to pursue his education. While here \nhe obtained two loves, his wife and his new country. He met his U.S. citizen wife while \nhe was in college and his son was born while he was in graduate school. He obtained a \njob as an engineer for a defense contractor and has held a security clearance for about \n20 years without incident. He is committed to his wife and son. He has five siblings and \ntheir families who are American citizens. His life, career, assets, and allegiance all lie in \nthe United States, as does much of his family. His mother and sisters in Iran have no \nconnection to the Iranian government and are unaware of what Applicant does for a \nliving or that he holds a security clearance. Under those circumstances, it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nIranian government, a terrorist organization, or his family members in Iran and the \ninterests of the United States. I further find there is no conflict of interest, because \nApplicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in America, that \nhe can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 \n8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8 (b) is applicable. No other mitigating condition is \napplicable. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Iran. He came \nto the U.S. to attend college. He met a U.S. citizen and married her. They have a son \nwho was born in the U.S. 29 years ago. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1980, and \nhis life and immediate family are now here. Applicant is an established, highly regarded \nengineer, with considerable U.S. ties and assets. Since Applicant left Iran more than 35 \nyears ago, he has only returned four times.  When he returned to Iran, he followed the \nadvice and the elaborate arrangements put in place by the State Department and \ntraveled on an Iranian passport. The renewal of his Iranian passport was not because \nApplicant maintained a sense of loyalty or allegiance to Iran; it was the only viable \noption for Applicant to travel to Iran, and the method suggested by the State \nDepartment. He has surrendered the passport to his security officer who destroyed it. \nHe does not consider himself an Iranian citizen. To the extent that Iran considers him \none of its citizens, he is very willing to renounce that citizenship. He has no intention on \nreturning to Iran for any purpose, even if his elderly mother becomes ill or passes away.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. Iran is the most active state sponsor of \nterrorism and has a dismal human rights record. That is not a good combination. I also \nnote that Applicant left Iran more than 35 years ago and only returned four times. He \nhas been a U.S. citizen for more than 27 years. His wife is a native born U.S. citizen. \nHis son was born in the United States, does not speak Farsi, and has never been to \nIran. He has a high level job, the respect of colleagues, and U.S. assets of well over \n$1,000,000. His elderly mother has permanent residence status in the U.S., and splits \nher time between the U.S. and Iran. She is currently living in Iran. His mother and \nsisters have no connection to the Iranian government. These facts minimize any \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. Applicant was sincere, open, \nand honest at the hearing. In the unlikely event that his mother or sisters were subjected \nto coercion or duress from the Iranian government or terrorist groups, I find that \nbecause of his deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., including \nhis uncompromising commitment to his country, wife, and son, that Applicant would \nresolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the \nUnited States.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his Foreign \nPreference and Foreign Influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEDWARD W.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to intoxication, from at least 1984 to at least May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); that he was treated on eight separate occasions for alcohol dependence between 1988/89 and July 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.1.h); and that he relapsed at least once since July 2006 despite participation in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) (SOR \u00b6 1.k). Applicant admitted the allegations, but added that he has completely abstained from alcohol consumption since December 31, 2006. His admissions are incorporated as factual findings.

Applicant is a 49-year-old contract change specialist, who has been employed by a defense contractor since November 1988. He seeks to retain the secret-level security clearance that was granted to him in November 2002 (Ex. 1, Tr. 96). Applicant experimented with marijuana, and began to drink alcohol in high school, about a six-pack of beer one weekend per month (Ex. 8). While in college from September 1977 to May 1981 (Ex. 1), he used a half-ounce of marijuana per week on average and drank alcohol with increasing frequency.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Matthew E. Auger, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on November 30,\n2005. On July 2, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline G that provided the basis for its decision to deny him a security clearance.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 24, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 17,\nMarch 11, 2009\n\n2\n2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for him. On November 21, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for\nDecember 18, 2008.\nThe hearing was held as scheduled. Eleven government exhibits (Ex. 1-11) and\ntwo Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-B) were admitted. Applicant objected to consideration of\ninformation in medical records (Exs. 5, 7) concerning past illicit substance abuse by\nhim. His objection was overruled in part. His past illicit substance involvement would be\nconsidered to the extent it affected his alcohol abuse and in assessing overall his\nsubstance abuse problem but not as an independent basis to deny or revoke his\nclearance. Applicant and four witnesses testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.)\nreceived on December 31, 2008. Based on review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant consumed\nalcohol, at times to excess and to intoxication, from at least 1984 to at least May 2006\n(SOR \u00b6 1.j); that he was treated on eight separate occasions for alcohol dependence\nbetween 1988/89 and July 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.1.h); and that he relapsed at least once\nsince July 2006 despite participation in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) (SOR \u00b6 1.k).\nApplicant admitted the allegations, but added that he has completely abstained from\nalcohol consumption since December 31, 2006. His admissions are incorporated as\nfactual findings. After considering the pleadings and record evidence, I make the\nfollowing additional findings.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old contract change specialist, who has been employed by\na defense contractor since November 1988. He seeks to retain the secret-level security\nclearance that was granted to him in November 2002 (Ex. 1, Tr. 96).\nApplicant experimented with marijuana, and began to drink alcohol in high\nschool, about a six-pack of beer one  weekend per month (Ex. 8). While in college from\nSeptember 1977 to May 1981 (Ex. 1), he used a half-ounce of marijuana per week on\naverage and drank alcohol with increasing frequency. By the end of his first year, he\nwas drinking alcohol every weekend. Within a year, he was drinking two or three nights\nper week in addition to the weekends. By the time he graduated in May 1981, he was\ndrinking on a daily basis, about a case of beer over the course of a week (Exs. 8, 10).\nHis drinking decreased in frequency and amount after college, although he\nbegan consuming mixed drinks at business luncheons. After he married in September\n1984 (Ex. 1), he began to drink more frequently with his spouse for whom a daily drink\nwas the norm (Ex. 8). In October 1984, he was arrested for driving under the influence,\nfailure to obey a stop sign, and for driving without a license (SOR \u00b6 1.i). The drunk\n\n3\ndriving charge was reduced to driving while impaired, and he paid a $270 fine (Exs. 3,\n7, 8).\nIn early 1985, Applicant\u2019s spouse (now ex-wife) discovered she was pregnant\nwith their first child, a daughter. She abstained from alcohol during her pregnancy, but\nApplicant continued to drink. While his spouse was expecting their second child, a son\nborn in January 1987, Applicant began drinking in bars instead of at home. An\nexperimental abuser of cocaine in college, he used cocaine with increasing frequency\nstarting in about 1986. By 1988, he was snorting the drug on a daily basis (Ex. 10). In\nMarch 1988, he was advised by his employer at the time to obtain professional help\nafter he reported for work intoxicated. Applicant attended once weekly outpatient\ncounseling sessions at a treatment center from about March 1988 to June 1988 (SOR \u00b6\n1.h). He managed to remain abstinent for only two weeks (Ex. 10). In April 1988, he was\nunable to account for his employer\u2019s nightly deposits that he had in his custody when he\nstopped off to drink at a bar. After it happened again in September 1988, Applicant was\nterminated from the job that he had held for more than four years. (Ex. 7, 10).\nIn November 1988, Applicant began working for his present employer as a sheet\nmetal worker. It was customary among some hourly workers to drink at lunch, and\nApplicant consumed alcohol at lunch when he first started with the company (Tr. 112).\nHe stopped using cocaine at the end of December 1988, but his drinking increased. He\nbegan taking cash advances from his credit cards to purchase alcohol and to pay bills,\nand this led to financial problems (Exs. 7, 10). In November 1989, he was issued a\ncompany-granted confidential clearance for his duties with the defense contractor (Exs.\n7, 9).\nIn late October 1990, Applicant and his spouse separated after a couple of years\nof aggressive behavior toward her (pushing and pulling) when he was intoxicated.\nFacing divorce and financial difficulties due to his drinking, Applicant voluntarily admitted\nhimself to a 28-day alcohol rehabilitation program at a nearby substance abuse\ntreatment facility (facility A) on November 3, 1990 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). He had consumed 12\ncans of beer and one-and-a-half pints of brandy on the day of his admission, and was\ndiagnosed with alcohol dependence. Applicant participated in individual and group\ncounseling, integrating well into his group, and all educational components of his\ntreatment. At discharge on December 3, 1990, Applicant minimized the problems in his\nmarriage by expressing a plan to return home even while his spouse refused to\nparticipate in his treatment. Aftercare plans included 90 AA meetings in 90 days, and 12\nweeks of aftercare at facility A. His prognosis for recovery from his alcohol dependence,\nthen in remission, was assessed as average. Applicant did not follow through with a\nreferral for outpatient counseling to deal with symptoms of depression (Ex. 10).\nThirty days after his discharge, Applicant relapsed into drinking. By mid-January\n1991, he was consuming alcohol at previous levels (Ex. 8). Realizing that he had lost\n\n4\ncontrol over his drinking and under the strains of a pending bankruptcy and conflict with\nhis spouse, Applicant readmitted himself to facility A on February 15, 1991, for another\n28-day stay (SOR \u00b6 1.f). By his discharge on March 17, 1991, Applicant had stabilized\nin sobriety, displayed insight into relapse triggers, and verbalized a strong commitment\nto abstinence with outpatient counseling and daily AA attendance. He decided to\nseparate from his spouse and aftercare plans included maintaining physical separation\nwith couple\u2019s counseling after 90 days. His prognosis at discharge was assessed as\ngood (Ex. 10).\nFollowing his discharge from the inpatient program, Applicant resided with his\nsister for six weeks. After about 30 days of sobriety, he had a one day relapse but\nresumed daily AA attendance with a new sponsor. On April 3, 1991, Applicant\u2019s\nemployer submitted an adverse information report to the Defense Industrial Security\nClearance Office (DISCO) informing of Applicant\u2019s voluntary inpatient alcohol\nrehabilitation treatments at facility A (Ex. 9).\nOn August 14, 1991, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator, in\npart about his alcohol consumption. Applicant indicated that he had moved back into his\nhome in about April 1991, and since then consumed one beer on five occasions, most\nrecently three weeks ago. Applicant did not deny that alcohol had caused many serious\nproblems (marital, financial, job loss) in his life, and that he would always be an\nalcoholic. In the event of a relapse, Applicant indicated he could rely on the AA program\nand friends \u201cto bring [him] back around.\u201d He added that his marriage was stronger than\never and his future was bright (Ex. 8). \nOn January 9, 1992, Applicant submitted a National Agency Questionnaire\n(NAQ). Applicant disclosed his 1984 fine for impaired driving, an October 1991\nbankruptcy, his use of illegal drugs between 1977 and late December 1988, the loss of\nhis job at the car wash due to his alcohol/drug problems, and his treatment programs at\nfacility A in 1990 and 1991 (Ex. 7).\nBy January 1999, Applicant was working on third shift for the defense contractor,\nas an overall supervisor with responsibility for several trades. With the recommendation\nof company management, he was hired to be an estimator in the change control\ndepartment. His main duties were to estimate the costs of building and repair work\nusing confidential proprietary information about labor rates (Tr. 25-26).\nFrom about 1999 to 2004, Applicant consumed beer while watching football\ngames in quantities of up to six beers per occasion (Ex. 3). In 2002, he suffered a\nseizure while attempting to withdraw from alcohol (Ex. 11). Sometime before September\n2004, he began stopping off at a bar after work about twice a month and drinking a\ncouple of beers before heading home. Concerned about the decisions he made when\nhe drank, and with his spouse upset over this drinking, Applicant readmitted himself for\n\nApplicant\u2019s father apparently died in July 2005 (Ex. 2).\n1\n5\ninpatient treatment to facility A in September 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant was treated\non a detoxification unit for ten days (Exs. 3, 6). Clinicians advised him to stay at a\nhalfway house after discharge but he elected to return to home and work (Exs. 3, 6).\nApplicant attended AA meetings about daily for about six months but slowly\ndrifted away from the program thereafter. He consumed wine with dinner or beer at\nsporting events, with some escalation of his drinking after his father died in July 2005.\nHe did not drink at bars after work (Exs. 3, 4).\nOn November 30, 2005, Applicant reviewed the SF 86 he had completed in 2002\nfor renewal of his secret clearance. He noted a change of position to contract change\nspecialist with the defense contractor, the death of his father and his participation in\nthree counseling sessions to deal with it,  and his treatment at facility A in September\n1\n2004 (Ex. 1).\nOn January 27, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator.\nApplicant was unable to provide specifics about his alcohol consumption in the\npreceding ten years, other than to indicate that he drank no more than six beers on any\nsingle occasion in the past five years and that he consumed alcohol on about six\noccasions, not to intoxication, from his last treatment until December 2005. He told the\ninvestigator that he believed he might be \u201csubconsciously dependent\u201d on alcohol, and\nhis future goal was to stop drinking completely (Ex. 3).\nShortly after his interview, Applicant began drinking again. On May 19, 2006,\nApplicant checked himself into facility A for detoxification treatment (SOR \u00b6 1.d). His\nblood alcohol level was .33%, and he was again diagnosed with alcohol dependence.\nHe reported drinking a pint of alcohol about daily over the past 30 days, despite\nattending AA meetings and having an AA sponsor. The following day, he discharged\nhimself against clinical advice (Ex. 2), as he thought he could undergo detoxification\nsafely at home under the care of his personal physician (Ex. 3).\nApplicant returned home only to drink a half to a whole pint of tequila daily (Ex. 5)\ndespite attending AA on 10 of the past 30 days and medication for depression and\nanxiety. In late May 2006, he underwent detoxification at a hospital (facility B) for five\ndays (not alleged) (Exs. 3,11). On June 7, 2006, he admitted himself to a residential\nsubstance abuse treatment program (facility C) (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He reported that he had\nbeen completely abstinent from alcohol for ten years, from 1991 to 2001 following his\nsecond discharge from facility A. However, he now believes that he was completely\nabstinent for only about five years (Tr. 111). Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol\ndependence and recommended for their inpatient program. Following an uneventful\n\n6\ndetoxification, Applicant entered the rehabilitation portion of the treatment on June 9,\n2006. He attended groups with minimal participation, and on June 12, 2006, discharged\nhimself against his therapist\u2019s advice (Ex. 5), because the program was not what he\nexpected (Ex. 11, Tr. 122-23).\nLess than an hour after he discharged himself from the residential treatment\nprogram, Applicant relapsed into drinking tequila a half pint or more daily. After\nApplicant voiced suicidal ideation to his insurer, he was evaluated at a local hospital in\nlate June 2006. He was referred to facility B, where he was diagnosed as alcohol\ndependent and underwent detoxification treatment from June 27, 2006, to June 30,\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant was motivated to recover but he refused to involve his\nfamily in his treatment despite encouragement to do so. At discharge, he planned to\ncontinue his treatment in a residential treatment program (facility D) (Ex. 11).\nApplicant went directly to the residential treatment program on his discharge from\nthe hospital (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His treatment for diagnosed alcohol dependence included\nregular group meetings, including AA, workshops, and aftercare planning. By his\ndischarge from facility D on July 21, 2006, Applicant exhibited an awareness and\nacceptance of addiction and a commitment to a self-directed recovery plan. He\nrecognized the severity of his use. Aftercare plans were to attend 90 AA meetings in 90\ndays, obtain a new sponsor, participate in an intensive outpatient program, and seek a\nnew therapist for grief and trauma work. He was continued on his medications of\nCymbalta (first used September 2005), Topamax (first used 2002) and Seroquel (first\nused May 2006) for anxiety, depression, and insomnia issues (Ex. 4).\nBy late 2006, Applicant\u2019s marriage was over due to the years of stress caused by\nhis abuse of alcohol. They were granted a divorce in January 2007 (Ex. 3). Applicant\u2019s\nmother and siblings are supportive of his sobriety (Tr. 101).\nApplicant remained abstinent from alcohol after his discharge from facility D until\nsometime in the fall of 2006. He began drinking one or two beers and it escalated until\nDecember 31, 2006, when he consumed \u201ca lot\u201d of alcohol to intoxication and\ncontemplated suicide (Tr. 92, 124-25). Fearing he would kill himself eventually if he\ncontinued to drink alcohol, Applicant prayed for help to get through that one day. He\nmanaged to put away the bottle and knife and he renewed his commitment to AA (Tr.\n99), going to meetings on a daily basis (sometimes twice daily) and obtaining a sponsor\nwith more than 20 years of AA affiliation. Over the almost two years of their\nacquaintance, Applicant had in-person contact with this sponsor at least once every two\nweeks if not weekly and by telephone every other day (Tr. 70). He observed positive\nchanges in Applicant about six months into their relationship. Applicant became more\nopen with him and other AA members, and he became actively involved by bringing\nothers to AA meetings and to rehabilitation. He described Applicant as \u201ca poster child\nfor AA right now.\u201d (Tr. 64-74).\n\nThe physician initially rendered this opinion in writing on October 1, 2008, but it was not signed before\n2\na notary until December 11, 2008. \n7\nIn November 2008, Applicant obtained a new AA sponsor because of the lack of\nface time with his former sponsor due to the latter\u2019s family commitments and residency\nin a different locale (Tr. 66-67). Applicant\u2019s current sponsor in AA has been sober since\nAugust 1998 (Tr. 77). He observed Applicant\u2019s struggles to deal with his alcoholism\nfrom AA meetings as far back as before 2001 (Tr. 88). Applicant asked him to be his\nsponsor because of his close physical proximity, his availability, and their friendship\nsince spring 2007 (Tr. 89). Applicant interacts with his sponsor on a daily basis. They\neither meet in person or talk earlier in the day and then attend the same AA meeting at\nnight (Tr. 84). In his opinion, Applicant is \u201cworking the [AA] program to the best of his\nability.\u201d He has found Applicant to be sincere and to share \u201cfrom the heart.\u201d (Tr. 85).\nApplicant has discussed with his current sponsor those triggers that have led him to\ndrink in the past (Tr. 93). As of mid-December 2008, Applicant was not receiving any\nprofessional counseling for his alcoholism apart from discussions with his primary\nphysician (Tr. 116).  He has not consumed any alcohol since New Year\u2019s Eve 2006 (Tr.\n121).\nThe person who sponsors Applicant\u2019s current sponsor also testified on\nApplicant\u2019s behalf. He is a  recovering alcoholic with almost 18 years of AA attendance\nand sobriety (Tr. 42, 45-46). He observed Applicant as much more committed to AA in\nthe past 18 months than he had been in the past (Tr. 52-54). He sees Applicant at\nmeetings or has heard from other attendees that Applicant attends AA meetings daily\n(Tr. 56).\nApplicant\u2019s primary care physician, who has treated him since November 2003,\nhas discussed Applicant\u2019s alcoholism with him during many office visits and is aware of\nApplicant\u2019s struggles with his addiction.  In his medical interventions with Applicant since\n2007, the physician had discovered no evidence that Applicant is drinking. In late 2008,2\nhe assessed Applicant\u2019s prognosis as \u201coutstanding\u201d:\nHe has demonstrated a real and sincere understanding of his alcoholism,\nhas immersed himself in his recovery through sustained participation in\nAA, has developed what appears to be a very supportive network, and\nseems genuinely motivated to remain alcohol free (Ex. A).\nApplicant intends to continue attending AA meetings once daily during the work\nweek and twice daily on the weekends. His current social circle consists primarily of\nothers in the AA fellowship. When he was first exposed to AA and told he could not\ndrink again, he worried about his future, such as how he was going to accomplish\nactivities without alcohol, and focused on all the problems drinking had caused him. In\n\n8\nthe past two years, he has learned to concentrate on the present knowing that he\ncannot take that first drink. As of mid-December 2008, Applicant was finishing up writing\na fearless and moral inventory, the fourth step in the AA step program (Tr. 102-05).  He\nbecame a sponsor himself for the first time in about August 2007, after confirming with\nhis sponsor that he should \u201caccept the challenge.\u201d He sponsors a couple of new AA\nmembers and makes himself available for others in AA (Tr. 106, 126-27).\n \nApplicant\u2019s work performance for the defense contractor was not negatively\naffected by his alcohol abuse, except to the extent that he missed work while he was in\nhis various treatment programs. Applicant did not drink before going to work and often\nstayed extra hours, in part to obtain the money to support his alcoholism (Tr. 100). A\nsupervisor involved in rating Applicant\u2019s performance between 1999 and 2008 did not\nhesitate in assigning Applicant some of the change control department\u2019s largest and\nmost complex tasks (Tr. 28-31). Within their larger organization of almost 100\nemployees, Applicant is one of the six or so with signature authority for the company.\nHe is authorized to commit the company to prepare and submit proposals on behalf of\nthe company to its military customer (Tr. 31). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n9\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure\nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\nuntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant\u2019s drunk driving offense from 1984 implicates AG \u00b6 22(a),\n\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\u201d However, the primary security concern in this case is with Applicant\u2019s\nserious alcohol dependency problem and his struggles to cope with that disease. \nApplicant began drinking in high school. Both in quantity and frequency, his\ndrinking increased progressively in college. By his graduation in May 1981, he was\nconsuming alcohol daily, about a case of beer over the course of a week. He began to\nuse cocaine in 1981 as well, and eventually his abuse of alcohol and cocaine led to\nproblems at work and at home. In March 1988, he reported for duty in an intoxicated\ncondition. He followed the advice of his then employer to obtain counseling but he\ncontinued to drink. Twice, in April 1988 and September 1988, Applicant was unable to\naccount for his employer\u2019s nightly deposits that he had in his custody when he stopped\n\nSee SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e plus the five-day detoxification in late May 2007 that was not alleged.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s primary care physician (Ex. A), as well as physicians at facility A (Ex. 10) and facility C\n4\n(Ex. 11) have diagnosed Applicant with alcohol dependence. From a review of the available clinical records\nof his various treatments, it is unclear whether other staff members who evaluated Applicant are licensed\nclinical social workers under AG \u00b6 22(e).\n10\noff at a local bar to drink, and he lost his job as a result. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201calcohol-related\nincidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired\ncondition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d has limited applicability in this case, however.\nApplicant has not had any alcohol-related problems at work since commencing his\nemploy with the defense contractor in 1989.\nBy late 1990, Applicant\u2019s abusive relationship with alcohol had caused him\nserious marital and financial problems. Following his second completion of a 28-day\ninpatient program for treatment of diagnosed alcohol dependence, Applicant was given\na good prognosis for recovery and he managed with the help of AA to remain abstinent\nfor as long as five years. Between September 2004 and June 2006, he admitted himself\non six separate occasions  for detoxification and/or alcohol rehabilitation treatment for\n3\nmedically diagnosed alcohol dependence, with varying degrees of success and\ncompletion. He discharged himself twice against therapeutic advice in 2006, including\nafter only one day of detoxification in May 2006. As evidenced by his blood alcohol\ncontent of .33% on that admission, he had developed a high tolerance for alcohol. He\nrelapsed again in the fall of 2006, to include to intoxication on December 31, 2006, after\ncompleting an uneventful detoxification and three weeks of residential alcohol treatment\nwith an AA focus. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional\n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence),\u201d  and 22(f), \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence, and\n4\ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program,\u201d clearly apply.\nConcerning the potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23, his relapse history\nprecludes consideration of AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Although Applicant characterized his drinking over the fall of 2006 as a\nsingle relapse, he drank on more than one occasion and to intoxication on December\n31, 2006.\n\n11\nApplicant has since maintained complete abstinence from alcohol with the help of\ncommitted involvement in the AA fellowship. In order for AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser),\u201d to apply, the abstinence\nmust be for sufficient time to clearly establish that Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and\nreliability are not subject to question. See ISCR Case No. 06-08708 (App. Bd. Dec. 17,\n2007). At one point in the 1990s, Applicant abstained from alcohol for a longer period\nonly to relapse into abusive drinking and additional failed rehabilitation efforts. Applicant\ndid not followup with the aftercare recommendations following his discharge from the\nresidential alcohol program in mid-July 2006. But the evidence also shows that\nApplicant did not fully accept that he was an alcoholic until December 31, 2006.\nAfter finally surrendering and realizing that he could not recover on his own,\nApplicant began attending AA meetings on a daily basis, sometimes two meetings daily,\nJust shy of two years later, Applicant is still attending AA daily. His former and current\nsponsors in AA testified that they observed Applicant\u2019s progress from being reticent to\nopen up to actively aiding others in their recovery efforts, including taking members to\ndetoxification or rehabilitation if necessary. While AA is not a recognized professional\nalcohol treatment program like the 28-day program at facility A, it appears to have\nsucceeded in giving Applicant the insight and support he needs to focus on the present\nand realize that he can have an enjoyable, productive life free of alcohol. In the opinions\nof those persons who have seen him struggle with his addiction, Applicant is now facing\nhis problem honestly and is doing all that he can to maintain his sobriety. He exhibited\ninsight into what he needs to remain sober, recognizing in November 2008 that it would\nbe to his benefit to obtain a new sponsor whom he could call and/or meet with on a\nregular basis. I find him credible when he expresses an intent to continue working the\nAA program. AG \u00b6 23(b) applies.\nAG \u00b6 23(d), \u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear\nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous\nor a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\nrecognized treatment program,\u201d applies in part. Applicant\u2019s present abstinence,\nconsidering his level of commitment to the AA program, is sufficient to establish his\ntrustworthiness and reliability with regard to arresting his alcoholism. While he\ncompleted two 28-day inpatient programs at facility A in the 1990/91 time frame, and\nmore recently the three-week residential treatment program at facility D, he did not\nfollow up with the latest aftercare recommendations. Applicant\u2019s primary care physician\ngave him an outstanding prognosis for recovery, but his opinion is not controlling,\n\n12\nespecially given the lack of information about the physician\u2019s experience in treating\nalcohol dependence.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant held a secret security\nclearance without any adverse incidents when he was actively abusing alcohol. While\nthis does not compel a favorable outcome, he is seen as less of a security risk now,\ngiven his two years of sustained commitment to his recovery. He has not consumed any\nalcohol for the past two years (since December 31, 2006). The potential for a relapse\ncannot be completely ruled out, but his sobriety is likely to be strengthened further by his\ncontinued involvement in the AA Twelve-Step program, and his assistance to others who\nturn to AA for help. He has a strong support network in AA and his family (mother and\nsiblings), and his past voluntary treatments suggest he would be willing to readmit\nhimself to an alcohol rehabilitation program if necessary.                                                   \n       \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nELIZABETH M.

Applicant is a 24-year-old quality engineer for a defense contractor. He is single. He started college in 2001, receiving a bachelor degree in engineering technology in 2005. As part of his employment with the defense contractor, Applicant submitted a security clearance application on September 28, 2006.1 Applicant admits that in March and November 2001, when he was 18 years old, he was charged with being a minor in possession of alcohol. He pled guilty both times and was fined $155 on each of the offenses. In March and April 2004, when he was 21 years old, he was charged with having an open container of alcohol in a car. He pled guilty both times and was fined $147 for each of the offenses. In December 2004, Applicant was drinking beer with friends before driving back 2 to college. He did not believe he was intoxicated. He fell asleep while driving and ran into a ditch. He failed a field sobriety test and his blood alcohol level was .11. He was charged with Operating a vehicle while intoxicated (OWI). He pled guilty, and was fined $30, received a one year deferred jail sentence, and ordered to attend an alcohol awareness class.

CREAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert E. Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a quality engineer for a defense contractor.  In 2001, he was charged with and\npled guilty to two separate offenses of being a minor in possession of alcohol.  In 2004, he had two\nseparate offenses of having an open container of alcohol, and also had an offense of operating a\nvehicle while intoxicated.  There have been no other alcohol-related instances since 2004.  He did\nnot deliberately omit the minor in possession offenses and the operating a vehicle while intoxicated\noffense on his security clearance application.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\n\nItem 4.\n1\nItem 5.\n2\nItem 6.\n3\n2\nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), using the\nnew Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.   Applicant acknowledged receipt\nof the SOR on July 17, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption), and Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 19, 2007.  He admitted all allegations under\nboth Guidelines E and G, and provided some explanation for his actions.  He elected to have the\nmatter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on October 11, 2007.\nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on October 17, 2007, and was\nprovided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions.  He provided additional information in a letter dated November 14, 2007,\nreceived at DOHA on November 20, 2007.  On November 20, 2007, Department Counsel noted no\nobjection to consideration of the additional material.  The case was assigned to me on November 28,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI thoroughly and carefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings.  I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 24-year-old quality engineer for a defense contractor. He is single.  He started\ncollege in 2001, receiving a bachelor degree in engineering technology in 2005.  As part of his\nemployment with the defense contractor, Applicant submitted a security clearance application on\nSeptember 28, 2006.1\nApplicant admits that in March and November 2001, when he was 18 years old, he was\ncharged with being a minor in possession of alcohol.  He pled guilty both times and was fined $155\non each of the offenses.  In March and April 2004, when he was  21 years old, he was charged with\nhaving an open container of alcohol in a car.  He pled guilty both times and was fined $147 for each\nof the offenses.   In December 2004, Applicant was drinking beer with friends before driving back\n2\nto college.  He did not believe he was intoxicated.  He fell asleep while driving and ran into a ditch.\nHe failed a field sobriety test and his blood alcohol level was .11.  He was charged with Operating\na vehicle while intoxicated (OWI).  He pled guilty, and was fined $30, received a one year deferred\njail sentence, and ordered to attend an alcohol awareness class.   He completed his period of\n3\n\nResponse to FORM, dated October 26, 2007.\n4\nItem 4.\n5\nItem 5.\n6\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n8\n3\nprobation, and the conviction was expunged from his records.   There are no reported alcohol-related\n4\nincidents since December 2004.\nApplicant completed his security clearance application on September 28, 2006.  In response\nto question 23d asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to\nalcohol or drugs, Applicant responded \u201cyes\u201d listing the two open container offenses.  He did not list\nthe minor in possession of alcohol offenses or the OWI offense.   Applicant stated he did not list the\n5\nOWI offense because he completed the sentence, thought the offense had been expunged from his\nrecord, and therefore did not need to be reported.  He now believes he should have listed the offense.\nHe did not intend to deliberately conceal the offense.  He also stated that his failure to list the two\nminor in possession charges was an oversight.  Again, he did not intent to deliberately conceal these\narrests.6\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n7\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.8\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2, amended by the new Administrative Guidelines, of the Directive sets forth the standards\nfor determining eligibility for access to classified information, listing the disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions to be considered for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair,\nimpartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances,\nas well as the whole person concept.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\n\nAG 2(a).\n9\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n10\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n11\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Oct. 7,\n15\n1993)).\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n16\nAG \u00b6 21.\n17\n4\nrecurrence.9\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n10\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\nmay disqualify the Applicant from access to classified information.   Applicant is responsible for\n11\npresenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\n12\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nsecurity clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to present evidence to disprove any mitigating\n13\ncondition.  Administrative Judges cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is\napplicable because the government does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating\ncondition.   \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct\n14\nunder any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to\n15\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d16\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.   Applicant\u2019s arrests for being a minor in possession of alcohol, for possession of an\n17\nopen container of alcohol, and for OWI raise Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC)\n\n5\n\u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, child\nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), and AC DC \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or\nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual\nis diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).  The two alcohol-related incidents in 2001\nand the three in 2004 are all incidents away from work.  Applicant was a minor when he was twice\narrested for possession of alcohol, and a college student in his early 20s when twice arrested for having\nan open container of alcohol, and when arrested for OWI.  The two incidents in 2001 are not\nconsidered an indication of habitual or binge drinking.  However, three alcohol-related incidents in\n2004, to include OWI, can be an indication of binge or habitual consumption of alcohol.\nSecurity concerns for excess alcohol consumption can be mitigated by consideration of Alcohol\nConsumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much times has passed, or the behavior was\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and AC MC \u00b6\n23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence\nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol\ndependent) or responsible use (of an alcohol abuser).  Applicant\u2019s alcohol incidents took place when\nhe was either a minor or a young college student.  He has matured, completed college, and earned a\ndegree.  There have been no alcohol-related incidents since 2004.  The security concern is for excess\nalcohol consumption that leads to questionable judgment resulting in concerns for reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  The open container, minor in possession charges, and one OWI do not indicate\nexcessive alcohol consumption.  It is not unusual for a minor to experiment with alcohol consumption\nor have alcohol in a car, or even drive after drinking.  These offenses do not indicate that the individual\nis an excessive consumer of alcohol.  These offenses happened when Applicant was young and\nimmature. The absence of any alcohol-related incidents for over three years while Applicant attended\ncollege and matured compared with offenses that happened when he was younger shows he presently\ndoes not consume alcohol to excess.  His current consumption does not cast doubt on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.  The absence of alcohol-related incidents for over three\nyears shows responsible use of alcohol, if not abstinence, and indicates Applicant has overcome his\nyouthful issues with alcohol.  I find Applicant mitigated security concerns for alcohol consumption.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list his two open container offenses and the OWI offense in response to\nquestion 23(d) on his security clearance application raises Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition\n(PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\nfrom the personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations . . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness).  Personal conduct is\nalways a security concern because it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify\nconfidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security\nclearance system depends on an individual providing correct and accurate information.  If a person\nconceals or provides false information, the security clearance process cannot function properly to\nensure that granting access to classified information is in the best interest of the United States\nGovernment.  Every inaccurate or incomplete answer on a security clearance application is a security\nconcern falsification or omission.  The falsification or omission must be deliberate and material.  It\nis deliberate if done knowingly and willfully.  A deliberate omission or false statement on a security\n\n10 U.S. C. \u00a7 1001.\n18\n6\nclearance application is a criminal offense under federal law.18\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list the minor in possession offenses was an oversight.  He did not\nbelieve he had to list the OWI offense because he competed the probation period and the offense was\nexpunged from his record.  These explanations are reasonable and conceivable.  Since Applicant is in\nhis early 20s and submitting his first security clearance application, he reasonably could believe that\nhe did not have to list offenses expunged from his record.  Likewise, he could reasonably not\nremember the minor in possession offenses because they were committed in his youth.  Applicant has\npresented sufficient information to show his failure to list the offenses was not deliberate.\nI have considered all of the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness.  I considered Applicant\u2019s candor and honesty in his self-evaluation of his use of alcohol.\nThe absence of alcohol-related issues for over three years considered in conjunction with the\ncircumstances of alcohol-related issues as a minor and college student shows that any present\nconsumption of alcohol is not excessive and does not create a security concern.  I conclude he is\neligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are;\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

(Gov 2 at 2-4.) \n \nAfter separating from active duty, Applicant accepted a job with a defense \ncontractor in May 2000. He worked in a military squadron. The defense contractor\u2019s \noffice was at another location.  The military customer arranged to send Applicant to a \ncomputer training seminar from 27-30 May 2003. The training was held in his former \nhometown. His brother still lived in the area. Applicant did not show up May 27, 2003, \nthe first day of training, which started at 9 am until the afternoon. He was advised to be \non time the next day. The next day, he left early in the afternoon. He did not attend \nclass the remaining two days. (Tr at 20-31; 84-92.) At hearing, Applicant admitted to \nvisiting with family members and friends during times when he was supposed to be at \nthe training seminar. (Tr at 91-92.)   \n \nApplicant left the area where the training was held on Friday, May 30, 2008, and \nreturned to his home on Sunday. When he returned to work, he completed an expense \nreport claiming expenses for the training even though he did not complete the course. \nHe also completed a time card claiming he worked eight hours each day during the \ntraining seminar. (Tr at 93-95; Gov 3.)  \n  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nWhen Applicant returned to the squadron, he told two co-workers, MSgt B. and \nMr. D., that the training was not \u201ccurtailed to his benefit.\u201d He did not mention that he \nfailed to attend most of the training sessions. (Tr at 94.) MSgt B. was contacted in the \nmiddle of June by the company who ran the training and informed that Applicant had \nmissed half a day the first two days of training, and failed to show up for training on \nThursday and Friday. They told MSgt B. that they cancelled Applicant\u2019s registration and \ncredited the voucher back to the government. MSgt B. informed them he would handle \nthe matter internally. (Gov 3 at 3.) The record is unclear as to whether MSgt B. informed \nApplicant\u2019s employer \u2013 the defense contractor.  \n \nThe Deputy Division Manager (and Facility Security Officer) of Applicant\u2019s former \ncompany testified during the hearing. He works at the defense contractor\u2019s office and \ndoes not work with Applicant on a daily basis. On September 1, 2003, he was informed \nthat the training company sent in a notification of reimbursement for the training that \nApplicant failed to complete in May 2003. The training company provided further details \nin an e-mail sent on September 2, 2003. Applicant\u2019s pay and travel records were \nreviewed. It was discovered that although he did not complete the course, Applicant \nsubmitted a travel reimbursement request for the entire period of the training and \nclaimed that he worked eight hours each day during the training period. (Tr at 19-21; \nGov 3.) \n \n On September 3, 2003, Applicant was called into the meeting with the Deputy \nDivision Manager and the program manager who worked with Applicant on a daily \nbasis. During the meeting, Applicant was informed that he was being terminated for \nfalse time charging and false expense reporting related to the May 2003 training that \nApplicant was required to attend but did not. Memorandums were prepared which \nsummarized what happened during the meeting. The Deputy Division Manager \nidentified these memorandums and testified that they were accurate summaries of what \noccurred during the meeting. He testified that Applicant was clearly informed of the \nbasis for his termination and that he was not subject to rehire. (Tr at 17 - 35; Gov 3; Gov \n4.)  \n \nApplicant was hired by his current employer in March 2004. On December 14, \n2005, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Position, (e-QIP) in \nconjunction with a routine periodic reinvestigation of his security clearance. He \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d in response to section \u201c22. Your Employment Record. Has any of the \nfollowing happened to you in the last 7 years? 1. Fired from job; 2. Quit after being told \nyou\u2019d be fired; 3. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct; 4. \nLeft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance; 5. \nLeft a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances?\u201d He did not list his \ntermination on September 3, 2003, from his previous employer. (Gov 1.)  \n \nOn October 11, 2007, Applicant was interviewed in conjunction with his \nbackground investigation. He provided a signed, sworn statement on that same date.  In \nhis statement, Applicant acknowledges being fired from his previous employer in \nSeptember 2003. In the statement, he explained that he attended a training seminar in \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2003 in relation to his job. He found that most training sessions were not useful for his \njob and he attended only two to three sessions. He admits to being paid on a per diem \nrate for travel and meals. (Gov 5.) At hearing, Applicant testified that he attended \nsessions on each day of the training seminar. (Tr. at 85-89.)    \n \nIn his statement, Applicant indicates that he was given a good evaluation and a \nraise in August 2003. Around that time, he noticed a co-worker was keeping a log of \nwork activities on her work computer. He reported her activity to his supervisor in late \nAugust 2003. On September 1, 2003, his managers contacted him and arranged a \nmeeting on September 1, 2003. He believed the meeting was to discuss the issue with \nthe co-worker. At the meeting, Applicant was asked to provide all of his papers and \nmaterials from his training in early May 2003. He met with his superiors again on \nSeptember 3, 2003. He was told that he was being fired during this meeting. He claims \nhe was never given a reason for the termination. (Gov 5 at 1-2.) At hearing, Applicant \nadmits that he was told during the meeting that he was fired for expense report fraud \nand submission of a false time card. (Tr at 101-106.) \n \nAfter he was terminated, Applicant filed a complaint with his former company\u2019s \ncorporate office. He claims there was an investigation. At the end of the investigation, \nhe was told that he was eligible for employment with the company at its other locations \nbut not at the location from where he was fired. (Gov 5.) He did not provide any \ndocuments to support this assertion.  \n \nApplicant states that he did not intentionally falsify section 22 on his security \nclearance questionnaire. He did not forget that he was fired but claims that since he was \ntold he was eligible for rehire that the termination was not unfavorable. He feels that he \nwas unjustly targeted during his time at his previous employer. (Tr at 112; Gov 5.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed that Applicant had financial issues. \nWhen Applicant separated from active duty, he started a small business. The business \nwas not successful and he incurred a lot of debts. As a result, he filed for bankruptcy on \nDecember 3, 2001. (AE B.)  He continued to incur delinquent debts after the bankruptcy \ndischarge, including: a $1,386 delinquent credit card account that was charged off (SOR \n\u00b6 2.d: Gov 6 at 4; Gov 7 at 2.); a $221 credit card account that was charged off (SOR \u00b6 \n2.e: Gov 7 at 2); a $1,169 credit card account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 2.f: Gov 4 at \n2-3; Gov 6 at 6; Gov 7 at 2); and a $2,125 jewelry store account that was charged off \n(SOR \u00b6 2.g; Gov 6 at 5; Gov 7 at 3). \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.g were included in his bankruptcy (AE B \nat 16, Schedule F, page 2; AE B at AE B at 12; Schedule D, page 1.) The debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 2.f is resolved. (Tr at 117-118; AE G at 9-10; AE I at 2-3.) Applicant entered \ninto a payment agreement pertaining to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d. He agreed to \npay $115.55 per month until the debt is paid. He anticipates it will be resolved after 12 \npayments are made.  He began making payments in June 2008 and has made four \npayments. (Tr at 114; AE G at 11-14; AE I at 5.)   \n\n \n5 \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant consulted a credit counseling agency.  The agency \nassisted him in preparing a budget. As of April 30, 2008, Applicant and his wife had a \nnet monthly income of $5,400.  Their total monthly expenses are approximately $4,679.  \nAfter expenses, they have approximately $721 in discretionary income. (AE G. ) \n \nTwo witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The Director of the military \nsquadron where Applicant works as a contractor testified that he has known Applicant \nfor four years. He states Applicant is vigilant about keeping computers and servers safe. \nHe claims that Applicant is the best LAN administrator he has worked with over the past \n20 years. He has no reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s integrity and recommends renewal of \nhis security clearance. (Tr at 57-64; AE A at 2.)  An electronics engineer who has \nworked with Applicant over the past three years testified. He works with Applicant \napproximately 3-4 times a week. He describes Applicant as professional and dedicated \nto his work. He does not consider him a risk. (Tr at 66-69.)  \n \n Applicant provided several reference letters. The Chief, Seekers and Sensors \nFlight states he has worked with Applicant for the past four years. He states Applicant \nbrings energy, enthusiasm, and commitment to his work.  He consistently delivers high \nquality products to the organization who quickly established himself as a go-to person. \n(AE A at 1.) Another coworker describes him as \u201cefficient, extremely competent, and \n[having] an excellent rapport with those he supported.\u201d (AE A at 3.) \n \nMaster Sergeant B. worked with Applicant at his previous employer and wrote a \nletter on his behalf. He states Applicant came to work in his squadron as a contractor in \n2002. He states that he was not fully trained for his position and Applicant took the time \nto train him. He states Applicant was always available when he needed assistance with \nany issue within the squadron.  He is aware that Applicant did not complete the training \nthat he was sent to in May 2003. He claims that it was not a problem because the \ntraining company refunded the training fee back to the squadron. (It is unclear whether \nMSgt B. informed Applicant\u2019s employer about the issue. It is also unclear whether MSgt \nB. is aware that Applicant was reimbursed for his travel expenses even though he did \nnot complete the course, and that he claimed full eight hour work days during the week \nof training even though he did not attend the training course for the majority of the \nweek.) MSgt B. claims Applicant\u2019s integrity has never come into question when he \nworked for him. He claims his patience, honesty and work ethic were the best he has \nseen in his 23 and half years in the Air Force. (AE F.)    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n7 \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because of Applicant\u2019s misuse of a \ngovernment credit card in 1997 when he was on active duty; his termination in \nSeptember 2003 for fraudulent time charging and expense reporting related to the May \n2003 training and his deliberate failure to list his termination in response to section 22 of \nthe security clearance questionnaire; and his statement in a signed, sworn statement \nthat he was not given a reason for the termination.  The government concedes the \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c should be found for Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s termination in September 2003 and the underlying conduct \nsupporting the termination raised Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) \u00b6 \n16(c ) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information) and PC DC \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse \ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be \nsufficient itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information -  (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) \nevidence of significant misuse of government or other employer\u2019s time and resources). \n \n \nIn May 2003, Applicant was sent to training by the government customer. He \narrived late the first day of training. He only spent half a day the second day of training \nand did not return for the remaining training. He decided that the training was not useful \nto him so he stopped attending. He did not seek authorization for leaving the training. \nHe did not leave immediately when he thought the training was not useful in relation to \nhis job. He admits that he has family in the area where the training was located, and he \nspent time with his family when he should have been attending training. He then \nclaimed expenses for the training when he actually did not complete the course, and \nalso claimed that he worked eight hours each day when he was at the training. His \nfailure to attend training violated his company\u2019s policies, and was an abuse of his \nemployer\u2019s and the government\u2019s time and resources. His conduct raises questions in \nregard to his judgment, untrustworthiness, lack of candor, and an inability to follow \nrules. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is further aggravated by his deliberate failure to list his \ntermination in response to section 22 on his December 14, 2005, security clearance \nquestionnaire and his statement that he was not aware of the basis for his termination in \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhis October 11, 2007, signed, sworn statement. This conduct supports the applicability \nof PC DC \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities). Applicant claims that he believed he did not need to list that he was \nterminated because he was informed he was subject to rehire at any other location \naside from the location that he was fired. In his response to the SOR, he claimed that he \ndid not have enough time to complete the questionnaire and did not read the question \ncarefully. I do not find his explanation credible. The language of Section 22 is very \nspecific. At hearing, Applicant admits that he was aware that he was fired. The outcome \nof the purported investigation did not change that. The government expects applicants \nto be truthful at all times. Self-serving justifications do not provide an excuse for failing \nto provide full disclosure. I find he deliberately failed to list that he was fired. I also do \nnot find Applicant\u2019s statement that he was not aware of the basis for the termination to \nbe credible. The Deputy Division Manager testified that Applicant was informed about \nthe basis of his termination. The memorandums prepared at the time of the September \n3, 2008, meeting verify what occurred during the meeting.  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to establish a prima facie \ncase and raise disqualifying conditions under Personal Conduct, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security \nconcerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating \ncondition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See, ISCR \nCase NO. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005.)  \n  \n \nThe following Personal Conduct Mitigating Concerns (PC MC) have the potential \nto apply: PC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) has the \npotential to apply to Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications. I find it does not apply. After \ncompleting his personnel security questionnaire, Applicant did not promptly come \nforward to correct his incorrect answer to section 22. He only admitted to being fired \nafter being confronted by the investigator conducting his background investigation. He \ncontinued to provide false information in his signed, sworn statement when he claimed \nhe was not told why he was terminated. At hearing, he continued to provide excuses for \nhis lack of forthrightness.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17( c) (the offense is so minor so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment); and PC DC \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior \nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to occur) potentially apply \nto the other issues under personal conduct. I find they do not apply. While Applicant is \nhighly regarded at his current employer, his refusal to accept responsibility for the poor \n\n \n9 \n \n \njudgment he demonstrated in his previous job which ultimately resulted in his \ntermination does not support mitigation. On his own volition, Applicant decided he did \nnot need to attend the training in May 2003. He fails to acknowledge that his failure to \nattend the training was irresponsible. He refuses to acknowledge that claiming travel \nand expenses for a training that he did not complete was fraudulent. He clearly did not \nwork four eight hour days during the training course. He sees nothing wrong with \nclaiming pay for these hours even though he was not working.  Essentially, the training \nappears to have been an opportunity for Applicant to take a paid vacation at the \ngovernment\u2019s expense (and ultimately the taxpayers) to visit family members. He still \nhas not acknowledged the gravity of his conduct. He self-rationalizes and blames others \nfor his own poor choices.  \n \n \nIf Applicant had come forward and admitted that he made a serious mistake in \nhis previous job and truthfully listed on his security clearance questionnaire that he was \nfired from his previous job, he would have a good case for mitigation considering his \nfavorable work performance over the past four years in his current job. However, at \nhearing, \nApplicant \nprovided \ninconsistent \nstatements, \nevasive \nanswers, \nand \ndemonstrated a lack of insight as to the gravity of the incident which was the basis for \nhis termination from his previous employer. His repeated failure to accept responsibility \nfor his past errors in judgment remains a concern under personal conduct.   \n \n \nI find against Applicant under the Personal Conduct concern. \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has a history of financial \nirresponsibility. He misused and did not pay a government credit card in 1997 when he \nwas on active duty.  His financial problems in the 2000-2001 led to his December 2001 \nbankruptcy filing. After his bankruptcy discharge, he incurred several delinquent \naccounts.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFC DC \u00b6 19(c)(deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust) applies \nrelated to Applicant\u2019s history of breaching his fiduciary duty to the government and to his \nemployer. In 1997, while on active duty, he was issued a government credit card which \nwas only to be used for official travel. He used the card for personal purchases and \nfailed to pay the debt. In May 2003, he breached his duty towards his employer by \nfailing to complete the training seminar and filing for travel expenses and credit for \nhours not worked.   \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nApplicant has a long history of financial irresponsibility starting with the abuse of his \ngovernment credit card in 2007. He recently started to resolve his most recent \ndelinquent accounts. However, questions about his trustworthiness and good judgment \nremain based on his lack of insight about the gravity of offense which was the basis for \nhis termination from his previous job.    \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s failure of \nhis small business in 2001. He was unemployed for six months after he was fired in \nSeptember 2003. He has taken steps to resolve the delinquent debts that remain.  \nAlthough, Applicant\u2019s conduct was the basis for his termination from his previous \nemployer, he acted responsibly under the circumstances pertaining to his financial \nsituation.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies. Applicant attended financial counseling in April 2008. A budget was \nprepared as part of his counseling. Applicant appears to live within his means and has \ntaken steps to resolve his delinquent accounts.   \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.f. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e. and 2.g were included in his bankruptcy. He \nentered into a payment agreement with the debt alleged in 2.d and is making regular \npayments towards this debt.   \n \nWhile Applicant has made progress towards resolving his financial delinquencies, \nissues remain as to his trustworthiness and judgment pertaining to his breach of \n\n \n11 \n \n \nfiduciary duty towards his employer to file accurate travel and time reports. For this \nreason, I find against Applicant under Guideline F.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s active duty \nservice in the United States Air Force. I considered the favorable recommendations of \nApplicant\u2019s superiors and co-workers at his current place of employment. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s attempts to resolve his current delinquent debts. However, questions remain \nunder the personal conduct concern based on Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his \nSeptember 2003 job termination on his security clearance questionnaire as well his \nrefusal to acknowledge that his actions were wrong. Applicant mitigated the concerns \nraised \nunder \nfinancial \nconsiderations. \nConcerns \nremain \nabout \nApplicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness and reliability under the personal conduct concern due to his deliberate \nomission of his job termination and his refusal to accept responsibility for his past poor \njudgment.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges five incidents of criminal conduct during the period 1990\u20132005. In his Answer, Applicant admits four of the five allegations. He denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer since 2004. His current position or job title is help desk technician. The eight letters of recommendation are highly favorable to Applicant and express the overall opinion that Applicant is a suitable candidate for a security clearance (Exhibit A). Applicant has a history of criminal conduct. The five incidents alleged in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant (except as otherwise noted) are summarized as follows: \u2022 1990\u2013arrested and charged with grand theft, receiving stolen property, and carrying a loaded firearm in a public place; all charges were dismissed. \u2022 1991\u2013arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, driving a vehicle while having a .08% or higher blood alcohol, and carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle. 3 \u2022 2002\u2013arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, driving while having a .08% or higher blood alcohol, and a later charge of failure to appear.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 7, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The SOR\nalleges security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct. For the reasons\ndiscussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n3\nherein. \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on March 3, 2008, and he\nelected a decision without a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn March 21, 2008, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant on March 26, 2008, and it was\n3\nreceived by him on April 22, 2008. He replied to the FORM within the allowed 30-day\nperiod, and his reply consists of a letter from him as well as eight letters of\nrecommendation. Those matters are admitted as Exhibit A. The case was assigned to\nanother administrative judge on July 22, 2008, and it was reassigned to me on\nSeptember 2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges five incidents of criminal conduct during the period 1990\u20132005.\nIn his Answer, Applicant admits four of the five allegations. He denies the allegation in\nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nhis current employer since 2004. His current position or job title is help desk technician.\nThe eight letters of recommendation are highly favorable to Applicant and express the\noverall opinion that Applicant is a suitable candidate for a security clearance (Exhibit A).\nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct. The five incidents alleged in the SOR\nand admitted to by Applicant (except as otherwise noted) are summarized as follows:\n\u2022\n1990\u2013arrested and charged with grand theft, receiving stolen property, and\ncarrying a loaded firearm in a public place; all charges were dismissed.\n\u2022\n1991\u2013arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs,\ndriving a vehicle while having a .08% or higher blood alcohol, and carrying a\nconcealed weapon in a vehicle.\n\n3\n\u2022\n2002\u2013arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs,\ndriving while having a .08% or higher blood alcohol, and a later charge of failure\nto appear. He pleaded guilty to the DUI and the other charges were dismissed. \n\u2022\n2002\u2013charged with driving with a suspended license and an unlicensed driver.\nFound guilty of the second charge and ordered to pay a fine, fees, and placed on\nsummary probation for 24 months.\n\u2022\n2005\u2013arrested and charged with three offenses related to domestic violence.\nThe 1991 and 2005 incidents are discussed below. \nThe one-page court record concerning the 1991 incident indicates the defendant\nfailed to appear in court and an arrest warrant was issued in June 1991 (Exhibit 8 at 9).\nThe court record does not indicate the disposition of the charges or the arrest warrant.\nThe government did not present any record evidence showing the disposition of the\ncharges or the warrant. And the 1991 incident is not reported in Applicant\u2019s FBI\nidentification record (Exhibit 6).  \nIn his Answer, Applicant denied the 1991 incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and\nexplained that it concerned someone else:\nThis is the first time ever hearing about this. I believe someone else was\nusing my identity. Prior to this date, it was brought to my attention by the\n[police department] that someone else was using my [state] driver license\nnumber [-----123]. I immediately saw investigators at the [local] DMV, and\nfound out an employee from there had issued my license number to\nanother person (name unknown). I received a new [state] driver license\nnumber [-----456], which is current today.\nApplicant did not present any documentary information to support his explanation, but\nhe also denied this incident during his background interview (Exhibit 7 at 3).\nThe most recent incident happened in 2005 when Applicant was arrested and\ncharged with three offenses relating to domestic violence: (1) battery against a former\nspouse/fiancee; (2) willful cruelty to a child; and (3) willful cruelty to a child. The charges\nstemmed from an argument between Applicant and his wife that took place in the\npresence of children. Applicant explained that his wife slapped him during an argument\nand he defended himself by holding up his arms and pushing back (Exhibit 7 at 2). The\npolice were called and Applicant was arrested based on his wife\u2019s report. In June 2007,\nafter several court appearances, the charges against Applicant were dismissed based\non his successful completion of a diversion program that required Applicant to satisfy\ncertain conditions, including completing 45 classes in a certified domestic violence\nprogram and attending 20 meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (Exhibit 8). \nIn his reply letter to the FORM, Applicant states the following: (1) that he deeply\nregrets the negative experiences of his life; (2) that he looks forward to moving past\nthose experiences and toward upward mobility for his life, family, and career; (3) that he\n\n Department of Navy v.

To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n5\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n7\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n17\n DC 3 is the \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n18\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n5\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n15\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.\u201d  \n16\nIn general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct.\nIn particular, DC 1  and DC 3  apply against Applicant as evidenced by his multiple\n17\n18\narrests, charges, and convictions, the most recent of which took place in 2005 and was\nresolved in June 2007 when the charges were dismissed. Applicant\u2019s involvement in\ncriminal conduct over a period of years calls into question his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. \nIn reaching this conclusion, however, I find for Applicant on the allegation in SOR\n\u00b6 1.b for the 1991 incident. The evidence supporting this allegation is a one-page court\nrecord. Applicant has rebutted this by his plausible explanation that he was not involved\nin this incident. In addition, if the incident was genuine, one would think that it would\n\n DC 4 is \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\n19\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d \n6\nhave surfaced and been addressed during one of Applicant\u2019s post-1991 arrests. And it\nis not reported in the FBI record. Given these circumstances, I am not persuaded that\nApplicant was arrested and charged as outlined in SOR \u00b6 1.b.\nThe guideline also contains several conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. The most pertinent is MC 4, which concerns successful evidence of reform\nand rehabilitation.  Applicant receives credit for complying with the conditions of the\n19\ndiversion program. As a result, the state court dismissed the domestic violence charges\nin June 2007. Likewise, he and his wife have reconciled, and he reports that their\nrelationship is now more stable. Nevertheless, these events are relatively recent\ndevelopments and it is too soon to tell if Applicant can establish a long-term record as a\nlaw-abiding citizen. At this time, his four incidents of involvement in criminal\nconduct\u2014the most recent of which was resolved last year\u2014militate against a successful\ncase in reform and rehabilitation. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant.\nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion\nto obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person\nconcept, to include Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence, was given due consideration and\nthat analysis does not support a favorable decision. This case is decided against\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, c, d, e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

He has mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\nEx. 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing, dated May 3, 2006).\n1\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 3, 2006, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation\nProcessing (e-QIP).  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a\n1\nsecurity clearance, and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  on June 20, 2007, detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nIn a sworn statement, dated July 10, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nrequested a hearing. Department Counsel indicated the Government was ready to proceed on August\n8, 2007. This case was assigned to me on August 9, 2007. Applicant\u2019s attorney filed a Notice of\nAppearance on August 10, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 14, 2007, scheduling\nthe hearing for August 29, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the\nGovernment submitted exhibits 1-6, and Applicant submitted exhibits A-D, all of which were\nadmitted into the record without objection. The record was left open to give Applicant time to submit\nadditional documents. Applicant submitted two additional documents, which were not objected to\nby the Government. The documents were identified as exhibits E and F and admitted. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on September 12, 2007.\nMOTION TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS\nOn August 7, 2007, the Government submitted a Motion to Amend the SOR by adding a new\nallegation under subparagraph 1 and adding paragraph 2 as follows:\n1.g  In about January 1986, you were charged with Driving Under the\nInfluence by the [state] Police Department.\n2. Guideline E:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process. Available information raising this concern shows that:\n2.a  You falsified material facts on a Standard Form 86, Security Clearance\nApplication, executed by you under date November 3, 2000, in response to \u201cQuestion\n24. Your Police Record \u2013 Alcohol/Drug Offense. Have you ever been charged with\nor convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs? For this item, report\n\nTr. 9-29.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s Answer, dated July 10, 2007.\n4\nEx. 2 (Security Clearance Application).\n5\n4\ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or\notherwise stricken from the record.

You were found guilty as charged on June 15, 2000.\nApplicant objected to the amendment of the SOR. In a written response, Applicant stated\n\u201c[t]he applicant has prepared his defense, the trial date has been set, and to now permit such an\namendment would require him to alter his defense to his detriment.\u201d As to subparagraph 1.g,\nApplicant argued that too much time had elapsed to review records in a 1986 incident, since those\nrecords may no longer be available. On August 22, 2007, the Government filed a reply objecting to\nApplicant\u2019s objection to amend the SOR. At the hearing, after hearing the parties\u2019 argument, the\nGovernment\u2019s motion to amend the SOR was granted.3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations. Those admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 53 years old and has worked as an electronics technician for a defense contractor\nfor the last 10 years. He served in the Navy from 1980-1996, and retired as a Petty Officer First Class\n(E-6) with an honorable discharge. He is married and has a 13-year-old daughter.\nApplicant started drinking at the age of 18. He continued to consume alcohol during his tour\nin the Navy. In 1986, in two separate incidents when he was out drinking, Applicant was charged\nwith DUI. He admitted these allegations, but believes that both cases were dismissed.  The record\n4\nis devoid of whether the charges were dismissed.\nOn April 21, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with illegal operation of a motor\nvehicle under the influence of alcohol/drugs. On June 15, 2000, he pled guilty as charged. He was\nfined, sentenced to community service, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. He\napplied for and received a permit so he could continue to drive to and from work.\nApplicant executed a SF 86 in 2000.  In response to Question 24, \u201cYour Police Record \u2013\n5\nAlcohol/Drug Offense. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to\nalcohol or drugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case\nhas been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement\nis for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued\n\nTr. 7-20. During the hearing, Applicant argued that the Government\u2019s Ex 2 (SF 86), did not have a signature\n6\npage and that the Government was relying on the signature date that Applicant authorized release of his medical records.\nTr. 116.\n7\nEx. I (Applicant\u2019s Affidavit, dated September 10, 2007).\n8\nEx. 3 (Interrogatories, dated May 25, 2007).\n9\nEx.

Applicant stated that he did not\n6\nintentionally omit this information.  Applicant objected to the admissibility of Ex. 2 because of\n7\nauthentication. The document proffered by the Government was unsigned. The Government relied\non the date on the \u201cAuthorization for Release of Medical Information,\u201d signed by Applicant on\nOctober 31, 2000. Applicant indicated that he signed the SF 86 on a different date, and he proffered\na sworn statement indicating that the document was executed on March 28, 2000.  He too relied on\n8\nthe date on the \u201cAuthorization for Release of Medical Information\u201d form and did not proffer an\nexecuted copy of the 2000 SF 86. In May 2007, Applicant completed interrogatories. During the\ninterview, Applicant made this statement: \u201cthe subject [Applicant] volunteered that in the summer\nof 1999 or 2000 (exact date not recalled) he was arrested for DUI.\u201d9\nFor three weeks in 2004, Applicant was treated at an inpatient alcohol-related program. A\ncertificate from the facility indicated that Applicant successfully completed the 10-week outpatient\nprogram at an institute recognized for providing alcohol and drug abuse treatment.10\nIn April 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and evading the police. He pled\nguilty to DUI and was sentenced to two years in jail, which was suspended after he served 120 days.\nHe was ordered to serve 100 hours of community service and two years of probation. His driver\u2019s\nlicense was suspended for three years starting in 2006. The suspension was reduced to a year based\non the installation of a special Breathalyzer device in his car. He has to breathe into the Breathalyzer\ndevice before he could start the car. The system would not allow him to drive if he has consumed\nalcohol. The charge for evading the police was nolle prossed. The probation will end in October\n2008.\nIn December 2006, Applicant participated in an alcohol counseling and education program\nand completed the program in July 2007, which included counseling and attendance at local\nmeetings to talk about alcohol issues.  In May 2006, Applicant ceased drinking alcohol.\n11\n12\nOn July 13, 2007, Applicant received an assessment of his condition from the institute that\ntreated him for his alcohol problem. His diagnostic impression was alcohol abuse, sustained and in\n\nEx. A (Assessment, dated July 13, 2007).\n13\nTr. 74.\n14\nId. at 80.\n15\nId. at 83.\n16\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The report revealed that Applicant is not in need of any treatment at this time and his\nprognosis for continued long-term recovery was good.13\nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. One witness, who has worked with Applicant\nfor over a year, was skeptical about Applicant returning to work after treatment in an alcohol\nrehabilitation program. This witness indicated that when Applicant returned to work, he was more\nfocused than ever and was once again a good worker.  The other witness was in the Navy with\n14\nApplicant and is currently his supervisor.  He was aware of Applicant\u2019s issues with alcohol. He\n15\nstated that after his incarceration, Applicant was \u201cmuch more comfortable with himself,\u201d and his job\nperformance has never been an issue.16\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n17\n\u201cthe authorities to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n18\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clear\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n19\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n20\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n21\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.22\n\n7\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all facts in evidence and the applicable legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nAlcohol Consumption\nAlcohol Consumption  may be a security concern because \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption\noften leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21)\nApplicant has four different DUIs. There were two DUIs in 1986, and in each case he was\narrested and spent a night in jail. However, the record does not reveal why those charges were\ndismissed. Applicant had a 2000 DUI and was found guilty. He was ordered to serve 100 hours of\ncommunity service and he lost his driver\u2019s license but got it back after a Breathalyzer interlock\nsystem was installed, which prohibits Applicant from driving if he has consumed alcohol. In April\n2005, he was charged with DUI. He was sentenced to 20 months of incarceration, but served 120\ndays. He was also sentenced to two years of probation. The probation will not end until October\n2008. On July 13, 2007, he received a diagnostic impression of alcohol abuse, sustained and in full\nremission and favorable prognosis for recovery. Consequently, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying\nConditions AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) and\nAG \u00b6 22d (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker\nwho is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns. Applicant participated\nin a 10-week alcohol treatment program in 2004. Then in December 2006 through July 2007, he was\nan inpatient at an alcohol treatment program. In July 2007, his diagnostic impression was alcohol\nabuse, sustained and in full remission and favorable prognosis for recovery. Applicant ceased\ndrinking alcohol in May 2006. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for three years starting in 2006.\nThe suspension was reduced to a year, because of the installation of a special Breathalyzer device,\nwhich will not allow him to drive if he has been drinking. His probation continues through October\n2008. Applicant has worked hard to combat his abuse of alcohol. I applaud him for being alcohol-\nfree for more than a year. Because his probation will not cease until October 2008, I cannot conclude\nthat Applicant will not abuse alcohol during this probationary period. More time is needed for\nApplicant to prove that his excessive alcohol consumption and periodic drinking and driving days\nare over. Thus, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken\nto overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\n\n8\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser) and AG \u00b6 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed\ninpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance\nwith treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a\nsimilar organization ad has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional\nor a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram) do not apply.\nPersonal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15)\nIn response to a question on the 2000 SF 86, he failed to disclose that he was found guilty\nof a DUI in June 2000. The document proffered by the Government, Ex. 2, is unsigned by Applicant.\nMoreover, the date on the exhibit is the date Applicant offered release of medical information.\nMoreover, in the SF 86 executed by Applicant on May 3, 2006, he does not list either the 1986 or\n2000 DUIs. However, during an interview on May 25, 2007, Applicant volunteered information\nabout his 2000 DUI. Consequently, I conclude that the Government received an honest answer to the\nquestion when Applicant volunteered information about his 2000 DUI during an interview in May\n2007. Thus, AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) does not apply.\nI considered all of the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.\nApplicant has made substantial progress in dealing with his long history of excessively consuming\nalcohol. He participated in a 10-week  alcohol treatment program in 2004. Moreover, he participated\nin a different alcohol treatment program from December 2006 to July 2007. His diagnosis was\nalcohol abuse, sustained and in full remission and favorable prognosis for recovery. He has been\nalcohol-free since May 2006. However, his behavior is still being monitored by the State and his\nprobation will end in October 2008. I conclude that while Applicant is on probation, he is still a\npotential risk. Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable\nfor access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 31, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Christopher Graham denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge made factual errors in the\nsynopsis and the body of his decision; whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law because the Judge failed to consider all of Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence or failed\nto give proper weight to that evidence; and whether the Judge erred by failing to take into account\nApplicant\u2019s 22 years of Naval service with a security clearance and the negative impact that an\nunfavorable determination will have on Applicant\u2019s current job.   \n1\nApplicant is a retired Navy member.  The woman he married in 2000 had several judgments\nagainst her when they married.  She was irresponsible in handling their financial affairs.  Applicant\u2019s\ncredit record was negatively impacted.  Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in 2001;\nthe petition was dismissed in 2003.  Applicant refiled under Chapter 7, and his debts were discharged\nin December 2003.  Since that time, Applicant has incurred over $30,000 in delinquent debt.\nApplicant set up repayment plans shortly before the hearing.  The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor\nas to six of the 11 debts listed in the SOR.\nApplicant disagrees with statements in the synopsis of the Judge\u2019s decision.  The Board\nreviews a Judge\u2019s decision in its entirety, not just isolated sentences, to discern what the Judge found\nand concluded.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-30587 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2005).  Absent unusual\ncircumstances, any flaws or errors in the synopsis of a Judge\u2019s decision are not likely to be harmful.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006).  Even if the Board were to\nassume, solely for the purposes of deciding this appeal, that there were errors in the synopsis, they\nwould not constitute harmful error. \nApplicant also cites factual findings in the Judge\u2019s decision which he considers to be in error.\nSome of the supposed errors are differences of interpretation or characterization.  However, even if\nthe Board were to ascribe error to the points Applicant makes, the errors would be harmless in light\nof the totality of Applicant\u2019s financial situation revealed by the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-\n20367 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2005).   \nApplicant argues that he has mitigated any trustworthiness concerns that might exist under\nGuideline F and that the Judge either did not consider or did not give adequate weight to his\nevidence of mitigation.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record\nevidence, unless the Judge specifically states otherwise; and there is no requirement that the Judge\nmention or discuss every piece of record evidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\n\n3\nNo. 04-08134 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2005).   Applicant admitted many of the SOR allegations\nagainst him.  The burden then shifted to Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns\nraised by those allegations.  The Judge concluded that Applicant did not present evidence sufficient\nto overcome the trustworthiness concerns raised.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them\napply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23,\n2007).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make\na favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence\nas a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice\nversa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   \n         \nApplicant points out that he held a security clearance in the Navy for 22 years without\nincident.  However, a history of financial difficulties raises trustworthiness concerns that can form\nthe basis of an unfavorable trustworthiness determination.  See e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-11627 at 3-4\n(App. Bd. Mar. 18, 2005).  Given the Judge\u2019s findings about Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, the\nJudge had a rational and legally permissible basis for concluding that Applicant\u2019s financial\ncircumstances raised trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F.  Moreover, it was not arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had not presented evidence\nto extenuate or mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by his financial situation.\nApplicant points out that an adverse determination will cause him to lose his job and his\nability to continue to improve his financial situation.  An applicant is not made more or less suitable\nfor a favorable trustworthiness determination based on how the determination might affect the\napplicant.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21012 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2005).\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness determination is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett   \nJeffrey D.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 42-year-old project controller employed by a federal contractor.  He married\nfor the second time in 2000.  From the outset,  his wife had numerous judgments entered against her,\nwrote several insufficient funds checks, and was totally irresponsible in handling their financial\naffairs.  He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2001, which was dismissed in 2003, followed by his\nfiling a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and having his debts discharged in December 2003.  He thereafter\nincurred over $30,000 in delinquent debts.  He commenced repayment of creditors one month prior\nto the hearing.  He did not successfully mitigate the trustworthiness concerns about financial\nconsiderations.   Applicant\u2019s eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P), dated August 3, 2006).\n1\nTr. at 6.\n2\nTr. at 14, 20.\n3\nId. at 16.\n4\n2\nOn August 3, 2006, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue his eligibility to\noccupy an automated data processing (ADP) position designated ADP-I/II/III.  As required by\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 14, 2007, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security\nconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  The President issued\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines\nare to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised\nguidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 5, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before\nan administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on August 15, 2007, and issued a Notice\nof Hearing on August 29, 2007.  I convened a hearing on September 14, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security clearance.\nApplicant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of the rule requiring15-days  notice of the hearing,\nbecause he had actual notice more than 15 days prior to the hearing.   The government offered ten\n2\nexhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-10.  Applicant offered twelve exhibits, marked as Exhibits A-L.  All\nexhibits were admitted without objection.  I kept the record open until September 24, 2007, to allow\nApplicant the time to file additional documents.  He filed 26 documents that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Trial Exhibits 1-26.  The government had no objection and the exhibits were\nadmitted.   DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR except for subparagraphs 1.c. and\n1.i.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 42-year-old project controller employed by a federal contractor.   He was\n3\ndivorced in 1995, remarried in 2000, and separated in March 2005.  He has one child from his first\nmarriage who lives with him.  He has completed two years towards a college degree.

In September 2003, he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, and was discharged\nfrom his debts in December 2003.  Since that time, he has accumulated $30,252 in delinquent debts.\nApplicant\u2019s chronological account of his marriage best details his continuing financial problems.7\nApplicant met his second wife in May 2000.  In June 2000, they became engaged, and he\nbecame a 50% partner in her cleaning company.  They were married August 26, 2000.  He wrote\nseveral checks to cover wedding expenses, which she promised to pay but did not.  In September\n2000, several judgments against his wife began to be attached to their bank accounts, freezing access\nto available funds.  This occurred because she signed for many things of value for her former\nboyfriend (boat, truck, and apartment), none of which he paid.  Also in September 2000, she received\na litigation settlement check of approximately $195,000.  Applicant was to receive $30,000, but it\nwas held in her account and the account was frozen.  In November, some of the company checks and\nseveral of Applicant\u2019s personal checks bounced.  The financial institution intercepted his paycheck\nand canceled the checking account.  In December 2000, creditors were calling saying they did not\nget paid, although his wife had told him she had paid them.  He questioned her, she apologized, but\nbecame verbally abusive and argumentative.8\nIn January 2001, Applicant begin having concerns about marrying his wife and having her\nruin his credit.  In February 2001, she continued lying about paying creditors as he was receiving\nphone calls from these creditors.  She stated she would order a check from the bank to cover all the\ndelinquent debt.  However, the check never appeared.  In April, more judgments against her were\nattached to the bank accounts.  He asked to take over responsibilities for handling the household\nexpenses, and she refused.  In August 2001, he filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in an effort\nto keep his house and vehicle.  The judgments kept coming and he could not keep up with all of the\nexpenses that were made by his family of six.9\nIn May 2003, he lost his house to foreclosure.  The loan was VA guaranteed so he can never\nobtain a VA loan again.  He conceded part of the financial issue was his fault, but placed most of the\nblame on his wife\u2019s mismanagement of funds, excessive judgments, deceptions, and refusal to let\nhim manage the money.  He also set up an allotment from his military pay for an apartment for the\nfamily to live in.10\n\nId. at 3-4.\n11\nId. at 5-6.\n12\nId. at 6.\n13\n4\nIn May 2004, his wife gave the apartment manager a bad check, the lease came to an end,\nApplicant stopped his allotment, and he was taken to court by the landlord.  He was allowed to stay\nfor 30 days, pay a late fee, and the amount of her insufficient funds check.  During this time he and\nhis wife were attempting to purchase a house.  Every time it approached settlement, she would not\nhave a check from the bank, making up various lies and excuses.  This happened three times.  In July\n2004, she applied to lease a two-bedroom apartment, using his military status to get the apartment.\nShe later told him that she rented the apartment so that her mother, two nieces, and two nephews\ncould live there since they were homeless.  She promised to pay all rent, and he trusted her again.\nShe and her mother and the grandchildren parted ways leaving her unemployed mother with no\nmeans to pay rent.  In August 2004, they had to move out of the apartment by court order.  His wife\nwent to another state to obtain an apartment for her mother.  Even though his credit record was\nruined with foreclosure and litigation, he signed this new  lease, as he had no place else to go.  Later\nthat month, she found a two-bedroom condo and convinced the owner to rent to them.  She lived\nthere with their two older children who were high school seniors.  In September 2004, she allowed\nher oldest son and a friend to sublease the unit where her mother was living, which was then in\nApplicant\u2019s name, so he would not be liable for breaking the lease.  They paid no rent, had other\npeople living with them, and trashed the apartment.  His wife passed another bad check.  In October\n2004, she had a judgment against her for the bad check.  At another apartment complex, his check\nhad bounced and she had promised to get the money out of the bank but never did.  He was taken\nto court, and because funds were frozen at the bank, they were forced to move out of another\napartment due to her alleged mishandling of the finances.  In December 2004, they were on the verge\nof eviction from a fourth-place because she did not pay the rent, forcing Applicant to borrow money\nfrom his friends.  They subsequently were evicted for nonpayment of rent.11\nIn February 2005, they moved to another condo, and his wife\u2019s check for her portion of the\nrent bounced.  (Eventually, they were evicted in August, 2005.)  In April 2005, he retired from the\nNavy, and the only income was his retirement check.  After the eviction, they were homeless, and\nthey went to live in an apartment paying $179 per day.  Their vehicle was repossessed, and he had\nto use a large portion of his retirement check to get the car back.  In October 2005, they moved to\na five bedroom townhouse.  The marriage was deteriorating, they tried counseling, but it was not\nsuccessful because the counselor told his wife that she should pay Applicant the money she owed\nhim.  In December 2005, she wrote Applicant a letter stating she wanted him to move out so she\ncould re-build her self-esteem.  He moved out in mid-December.  He notified the landlord that he\nwas moving and that his wife was the sole person responsible for rent.12\nThroughout 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife promised to give him money, saying she would pay all\nthe bills that were created during the marriage.  She felt responsible for him losing everything he had\nworked for.  She claimed she had filed for divorce, but he found no case on file.  In December 2006,\nshe made several threats about never paying him anything and that she could care less what a court\nmight say.13\n\nId. at 33.\n14\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B, debt discharged in bankruptcy.\n15\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C, debt discharged in bankruptcy.\n16\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D (Debt Action Tracking Sheet) at 1-2.\n17\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E (Debt Action Tracking Sheet) at 1-3.\n18\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit F (Debt Action Tracking Sheet) at 1-3; Applicant\u2019s Post Trial Exhibit 5 (Letter from Collection\n19\nAgency, dated September 18, 2007) at 1.\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit G (Debt Action Tracking Sheet) at 1-5.\n20\nApplicant\u2019s Post Trial Exhibit 3 (Letter from Bank, dated September 12, 2007) at 1.\n21\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit I (Debt Action Tracking Sheet) at 1-2.\n22\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit J (Debt Action Tracking Sheet) at 1-2.\n23\n5\nApplicant claimed that his wife received over a million dollars in lawsuit settlements, that\nhe never received any money from her, and provided no proof of these settlements.

Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n6\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\n24\nimpartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.25\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n26\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n27\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n28\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) \u201cThe Administrative Judge considers the record evidence\n29\n.   \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of the\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n30\n7\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d   The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\n28\nGovernment.29\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.30\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning financial problems.  \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d \nThe government established its case under Guideline \u00b6 19.  Two Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) raise trustworthiness concerns and are disqualifying in this case:\nGuideline \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and Guideline \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d  Applicant has a history of not meeting debts, as set forth in the SOR\nand government exhibits.\nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e)\nare potentially applicable:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n31\n8\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guidelines \u00b6 20(a), (c),\nand (e) do not apply.  The debts continued to be delinquent until the time of the hearing, he has not\nsought financial counseling, and there is no basis to dispute most of the indebtedness.  However,\nGuidelines \u00b6 20 (b) and (d) are at issue.\nApplicant blamed his wife for most of his financial problems.  His statements revealed a\nhistory of judgments against his wife, numerous insufficient funds checks written by her, and\nnumerous situations where he had to make payments to salvage assets or find housing for his family.\nHe also claimed that his wife received over $1 million in lawsuit settlements.  This argument lacks\ncredibility.  I seriously doubt she ever received any such settlements.  If she had access to that\namount of money, it is inconceivable that she would have all of the various judgments entered\nagainst her, or bounce numerous checks, and would have provided for her mother and other family\nmembers if they were in need.  As early as 2001, he was questioning the wisdom of his marriage due\nto his wife\u2019s financial irresponsibility.  Yet for the next five years, he continued to live in financial\nexigency.  This is not a pattern of events beyond his control.  He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and had\nhis debts discharged in December 2003.  Yet for another three years, he accumulated over $30,000\nin delinquent debts.  Further, he only started making payment plans with his creditors a month or less\nprior to the hearing.  This is not a good-faith effort at resolving indebtedness, because he just started.\nHe has established no track record to show that his efforts have been successful.  By allowing\nhimself to get in this financial situation, he has demonstrated poor judgment and a lack of\nresponsibility and trustworthiness.  I find that no mitigating conditions are applicable and I conclude\nGuideline F against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n31\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\n\nId.\n32\nId.\n33\n9\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n32\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (42),\n33\nhis education, his employment, his military service, and the causative factors of his financial\ndelinquencies.  He had financial problems from the outset of his marriage in 2000.  Even after having\nhis debts discharged in bankruptcy, he allowed himself to incur unpaid debts.  He recognized there\nwas a problem in 2001, and yet continued to live in the same manner for the next five years.  While\nit might be easy to assess blame to his wife, he used poor judgment in not stepping in and correcting\nthe problem a long time ago.  This raises questions about his reliability and judgment.  The totality\nof the record  raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified\ninformation and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the\ngovernment entrusts its interests.  I conclude that Applicant is not entitled to a favorable eligibility\ndetermination.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Le\u2019i, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Sheldon I. Cohen, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 1,\n2005. On June 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines B and C\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 10, 2007. He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 12, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. DOHA received the request on July 17, 2007. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on September 12, 2007, and another administrative judge received\nthe case assignment on September 19, 2007. The case assignment was transferred to\nme on October 10, 2007, due to workload considerations. I granted Applicant\u2019s request\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\n2\nfor a delay until December 4, 2007, in order for his counsel to be available. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on November 8, 2007, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on December 4, 2007. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3,\nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, as did four\nother witnesses, and submitted exhibits (AE) A through Y, which were admitted without\nobjection. Applicant\u2019s counsel also offered a hearing memorandum, and copies of the\ndecisions by the administrative judge and Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-21190,\nthat were accepted into the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) III. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 18, 2007. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Dismiss\nApplicant\u2019s counsel moved to strike SOR \u00b6 1.d, alleging that Applicant\u2019s \u201cbrother\nis a dual citizen of the United States and Israel, residing in the United States.\u201d He\nargued that the paragraph failed to allege facts that could raise a disqualifying condition\nbecause the brother could not be considered a \u201cforeign\u201d family member if he resides in\nthe United States. (HE I; Tr. at 14.) Department Counsel objected to the motion, arguing\nthat Applicant\u2019s counsel had not shown that a dual citizen family member could not\npossibly create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, etc., under AG \u00b6 7(a), simply by\nvirtue of current residence in the United States. (HE II; Tr. at 17.) I denied the motion on\nthe grounds that \u00b6 7(a) contemplates potential security concerns arising from, inter alia,\n\u201cforeign family members\u201d and \u201cother persons\u201d who are citizens of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if contact with that person creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, etc.\nAccordingly, application of that disqualifying condition turns on demonstration of\nheightened risk arising from the contact with anyone who is a foreign citizen or resident,\nnot on whether the definition of \u201cforeign family member\u201d requires residence abroad. (Tr.\nat 19.)\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Israel. (HE IV; Tr. at 22.) The request and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing\nExhibit IV. Department Counsel submitted eight reference documents in support of the\nrequest that were marked administrative notice (AN) exhibits I through VIII. Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel argued that the facts administratively noticed must be limited to matters of\ngeneral knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. He pointed to several\nstatements in various AN documents, and submitted AE F through X, to dispute some of\nthe proposed administrative notice facts and inferences. He further lodged specific\nobjection to the use of AN VIII, the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff Intelligence\nThreat Handbook, for purposes of administrative notice because it was written by a\nprivate contractor. (Tr. at 23-56.) There is no rule of law requiring that a source\n\n3\ndocument be produced by a government employee or agency to be sufficiently reliable\nfor citation in support of administrative notice of a fact. The facts administratively noticed\nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d, of the SOR, with\nexplanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g of the SOR, explaining\nthat they were only partially correct. He also provided additional information to support\nhis request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s admissions are\nincorporated in the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old dual citizen of the United States and Israel, residing in\nthe United States. He earned his PhD in computer science from an American university\nin 1993, and is a self-employed research consultant under contract with the Department\nof Defense. He successfully held a Secret security clearance from 1994 to 1997, while\nemployed by an aerospace defense contractor. He is happily married, with four children\nages 15, 12, 11, and 4.\nApplicant was born in the U.S., as a fourth-generation American on his mother\u2019s\nside. He was the eldest of four children when, at age ten, his mother and father moved\ntheir family to Israel. Applicant\u2019s father had an appointment to establish a new\ndepartment at an Israeli university, where he worked for two or three years until his\nfunding was not renewed. Thereafter, Applicant\u2019s mother supported the family by\nteaching in a high school. His father never resumed employment due to disagreements\nwith the Israeli higher education system. His father is now 70 and his mother is 69 years\nold. She retired from teaching, and receives a pension from the government, which she\nsupplements by tutoring private students in English. Applicant\u2019s parents continue to live\nin Israel, as do his sister, her husband and children. \nBy Israeli law, Applicant\u2019s mother and all the children became Israeli citizens\nthree years after they moved to Israel. They retained their U.S. citizenship as well. After\nlosing his job, Applicant\u2019s father did not want to remain in Israel and did so only at his\nwife\u2019s insistence. He formally declined Israeli citizenship and became a permanent\nresident instead. This entailed all the obligations of citizenship, including compulsory\nmilitary service, but did not confer the right to vote or hold elected office. Applicant and\nhis two brothers served their compulsory military service in the Israeli Defense Forces\n(IDF) between ages 18 and 21.\nApplicant\u2019s parents, sister and family  know he is performing defense-related\nwork and applying for a clearance because he told them that was why he needed some\ninformation from them to complete his application. Applicant visited his parents in Israel\nduring September 1989 and February 1993. Applicant and his wife visited his parents in\nIsrael for a few weeks in 1998, and again in 2000, when his sister was married.\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a home-maker. Her husband, who is an Israeli citizen, works as a\ncomputer programmer in Israel for a U.S.-owned company. She and their two children\nare dual U.S. and Israeli citizens. Applicant used his U.S. passport for all foreign travel,\nincluding these trips to Israel, since he moved to the U.S. because he considers himself\nprimarily a U.S. citizen. He has not formally renounced his Israeli citizenship, but is\nwilling to do so if asked. (Tr. at 274-275.) His Israeli passport has long-expired, and has\nbeen neither renewed nor used since he came to the U.S. in 1988.\nApplicant\u2019s military service in Israel, from July 1979 to October 1982, was a\ndifficult period in his life. He started service as a drill instructor training older, immigrant\nsoldiers beginning their compulsory service. When hostilities broke out during the first\nLebanese war, he transferred to an artillery unit. Rather than assume the normal duties\nfor his rank and experience, he was assigned to menial duties and was hazed by\nseniors, peers, and subordinates due to his prior duty as a drill instructor. \nApplicant left active service upon completion of his obligated time, and began\nrequired reserve duty while attending college in Israel. His next-oldest brother was killed\nduring the summer of 1985, while serving in the Israeli Army, in what the family was told\nwas a training accident. Applicant, with recent military training and experience himself,\nfound the official explanation of the circumstances of his brother\u2019s death to be\nincredible. He expressed his doubts to the army officials, including a general officer,\nwho visited the family during their period of mourning. Thereafter, Applicant was\nassigned to distasteful reserve duties outside his regular military specialty. \nFrom 1982 to 1988, Applicant finished his bachelor\u2019s degree in aeronautical\nengineering and master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering at an Israeli university. During\nthe summers of 1983, 1984, and 1985, he was employed as a summer intern by Israeli\nAircraft Industries. From September 1986 to August 1988, he was employed by his\nuniversity under a teaching graduate assistant stipend program. He maintains neither\nprofessional nor personal connections with anyone from either period of employment in\nIsrael. Applicant voted in Israeli elections while he lived there, between 1979 and 1988.\nSince moving to the U.S., he has voted regularly in American elections but never in\nIsraeli elections. \nApplicant moved to the United States in 1988 to pursue his PhD in computer\nscience. He met his wife, who is his second cousin, at a family gathering shortly\nthereafter. They were married in 1990, and she supported their family until he\ncompleted his degree in 1993. His grandparents, and her entire branch of the family\nremained in the area where his family lived before moving to Israel. After working for a\ndefense contractor in a different city for almost four years, Applicant, his wife, and their\nchildren moved back to the family hometown in 1997. They have lived in Applicant\u2019s\nmother-in-law\u2019s house ever since, while saving money to buy their own home. This took\na long time because housing prices grew rapidly, and they also bore costs of private\nschooling for their children. They recently purchased a home, and are awaiting\ncompletion of a remodeling project to move in. Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement\nreflects a net worth in excess of $920,000, and an annual income that exceeds annual\n\n5\nexpenses by more than $250,000. (AE B.) Applicant and his wife are deeply involved\nwith their church and their children\u2019s school communities. \nApplicant\u2019s surviving youngest brother is also a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen,\ntrained as a computer expert. The untimely death of their middle brother greatly\ndisturbed him. He left regular employment to pursue eastern religions seeking solace.\nHe eventually became disillusioned with religion altogether, moved back to the U.S.,\nand has worked sporadically as a bus driver in various tourist resort areas. Applicant\nhas infrequent contact with this brother. He communicates with his parents about once\na week, and with his sister about once a month. His parents last visited Applicant here\nin the U.S. in August 2004. They visited about every other year before that, but health\nconcerns have prevented their travel since then. Applicant\u2019s sister and her family also\ncame for the August 2004 visit, to celebrate his eldest daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah.\nDuring the 1994 background investigation preceding Applicant\u2019s receipt of his\nprevious security clearance, he told the investigator, \u201cIf Israel should come under attack,\nI would return to Israel and rejoin the army.\u201d (GE 3 at 5.) When asked about this\nstatement in connection with his current clearance application, he responded to the\n\u201cForeign Influence and Foreign Preference Interrogatory\u201d question 33 by stating, \u201cI will\nnot return to Israel if it were attacked today. I have four children and family obligations in\nthe U.S. and consider myself a U.S. citizen.\u201d (GE 2 at 21.) He credibly testified during\nthe hearing that he would not now return to Israeli military service. He is older and\nconsiders his obligations in and to the U.S. to completely outweigh any obligation to\nIsrael. He has redefined his Jewish identity in terms of practicing religion rather than the\nnational affiliation to Israel that he was formerly taught by his secular parents. (Tr. at\n271-276, 287-290.) Four witnesses: a professional colleague, a close family friend,\nApplicant\u2019s uncle and his wife, all confirmed these changes in his attitude and his\ncurrent allegiance to the United States. (Tr. at 117-118, 135-137, 168-169, 210-211.) If\nfaced with the highly unlikely situation in which Israel and the United States became\nhostile, as opposed to the close friendship and alliance that currently exists, all\ntestimony confirmed that Applicant would fully support the United States in whatever\ncapacity he was asked. His earlier statement about returning to defend Israel was true\nat the time, and was based upon lingering feelings of family and national duty, and his\nrelatively short time back in the U.S.. \nThe uncontroverted evidence establishes that Applicant is highly principled, with\ngreat integrity and strong character. He does not permit his family members to borrow\nor use pirated entertainment media. When his wife offered to send baked goods to his\noffice during his previous classified employment, he refused to tell her how many people\nhe worked with because that was protected information. He refused funding from a\npotential investor, in a start-up company that he founded, because the man lacked\nintegrity. He considers voting a solemn obligation of citizenship, and has not missed an\nelection since returning to the U.S. He refuses to shade data interpretation to his\npotential business benefit, and insists on full integrity from all colleagues as well. He\ndislikes some aspects of the Israeli government system, and harbors significant distrust\nand resentment toward their military leadership over what he considers to be a coverup\n\n6\nof the circumstances surrounding his brother\u2019s death. (Tr. at 112, 128, 130, 164, 202-\n209, 211, 216-217, 222, 259, 266; AE C; AE D; AE E.) \nIf Applicant\u2019s family in Israel were approached by the Israeli government in an\nattempt to obtain protected information from Applicant, he would immediately report that\nto security and law enforcement authorities for three reasons. He would not compromise\nhis integrity. He believes submitting to any such coercion would only lead to more, and\nwould not end any threat. Finally, he is confident that Israel would not risk good\nrelations with the U.S. by continuing any such attempt once it was known to U.S.\nauthorities. (Tr. at 218-219, 276-277.) \nAlthough Applicant has no independent desire to ever visit Israel again, he\nrecognizes that family obligations may cause him to do so in the future. (Tr. at 284.)\nApplicant owns no property in Israel, but his parents, sister, and brother each own\nhomes there. His understanding is that when his last surviving parent passes away,\ntheir house will be sold and each sibling will inherit one third of its value. That property is\npresently worth about $450,000. (Tr. at 236-237, 291-292.) \nI take administrative notice of the following facts, which are supported by AN I\nthrough VIII and material to determining Applicant\u2019s security worthiness. Israel is a\nparliamentary democracy whose prime minister heads the government and exercises\nexecutive power. Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced economy that is\ngrowing at about 5.2% per year, and the United States is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner.\nAlmost half of Israel\u2019s exports are high tech and its major industrial sectors include high-\ntechnology electric and bio-medical equipment. The Israeli government generally\nrespects the human rights of its citizens, although there are some issues with respect to\ntreatment of some Palestinian detainees and discrimination against Israel\u2019s Arab\ncitizens that have no relevance to circumstances affecting Applicant or his family. \nThe Israeli government does not support or sponsor terrorism or terrorist\norganizations, and is a strong U.S. ally in fighting terrorism. Terrorist suicide bombings\nare a continued threat in Israel, and reliable information indicates that American\ninterests could be the focus of terrorist attacks. As is typical in most parts of the world,\nAmerican citizens have been urged to exercise a high degree of caution and common\nsense in public places, especially those near or associated with U.S. interests. The IDF\nhas long-standing, close ties to the U.S. military, including operational, research and\ndevelopment programs. Commitment to Israel\u2019s security and well being has been a\ncornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948, and the two\ncountries are bound closely by historic and cultural ties, as well as mutual values and\ninterests.\nThere have been some issues of concern between the U.S. and Israel, including\nIsrael\u2019s proposed foreign military sales to third nations, Israeli protection of intellectual\nproperty, and espionage-related cases. (AN V at 2.) In general, Israel has curtailed or\nended military sales to which the U.S. objected. (AN V at 25-26.) The intellectual\nproperty concerns related to biotechnology copyrights, pharmaceutical patents, and\n\n7\npiracy of software, music and DVDs. U.S. concerns were addressed by Israeli\nauthorities. (AN V at 27.) One espionage case involved Jonathan Pollard, who is\nserving a life sentence for selling classified documents to Israel, and his wife. The only\nother Israel-related espionage case in the record involves former DoD analyst Lawrence\nFranklin, who pled guilty to conspiracy to communicate national defense information to\nunauthorized persons, unlawful retention of national security defense information, and\nconspiracy to communicate classified information to an agent of a foreign government.\nHe was sentenced to confinement for 12 years and 7 months, and a $10,000 fine. (AN\nV at 26-27; AE F at 5, 20.) Two former officials of the American Israeli Political Action\nCommittee are pending trial on related conspiracy charges. Some unidentified press\nreports purportedly identified an employee of the Israeli Embassy in Washington as the\nagent of a foreign government involved, but no evidence was supplied to confirm that\nallegation. Of the 150 cases of espionage against the U.S. by American citizens\nbetween 1947 and 2001 that were reported in the Defense Personnel Security\nResearch Center Technical Report 02-5 (July 2002), only the Pollards\u2019 case involved\nIsrael. (AE V.) Other recently reported espionage arrests and prosecutions involved an\nopposition group in the Republic of the Philippines (AE W), the international terrorist\ngroup Hizballah (AE X), and the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nThe National Counterintelligence Center (NACIC) prepared an Annual Report to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage each year from\n2000 to 2005 (released in Aug. 2006) (AN VI; AN VII: AE K: AE L; AE M; AE N.) The\nfirst \u201cKey Finding\u201d of the most recent report was, \u201cEntities from a record number of\ncountries \u2013 108 \u2013 were involved in collection efforts against sensitive and protected US\ntechnologies in the FY 2005, according to evidence amassed by the Counterintelligence\n(CI) Community. A relatively small number of countries, though \u2013 including China and\nRussia \u2013 were the most aggressive and accounted for much of the targeting, just as\nthey have since the CI Community first began systematically tracking foreign technology\ncollection efforts in 1997.\u201d (AN VI at iii.) China and Russia are the only countries\nidentified as among the most aggressive collectors, although the report states that, \u201cThe\nmajor collectors have been repeatedly identified targeting multiple US Government\norganizations and all types of technologies since at least 1997, when the CI Community\nfirst began systematically reporting on targeting efforts.\u201d (AN VI at 2.) The reports from\n2001 to 2004 identify press reports of cases involving China, Pakistan, and Iran (AE K\nat 5.); an unspecified \u201claundry list\u201d of 75 countries, rich and poor, friend and foe active in\n2001 (AE L at viii, 10.); an unspecified description of more than 90 countries, with a few\n(also unidentified) key countries accounting for the bulk of attacks in 2002-2003 (AE M\nat v, 3.); and a reportedly \u201chigh degree of unanimity among Community members\u201d\nconcerning the \u201conly a few countries,\u201d out of almost 100 identified in FY 2004, from\nwhom the gravest threat to U.S. technologies come \u2013 again without naming any specific\ncountry (AE N at ix, 3.). \nThe Government sought administrative notice of the fact that, \u201cThe [NACIC\u2019s]\n2000 Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists\nIsrael as one of the active collectors of proprietary information.\u201d The accompanying\nfootnote clarified that this list purports to name the \u201cmost\u201d active collectors, and was\n\n8\ncompiled based on a survey of private industry. The list  is not the body of the report,\nbut appears in an appendix entitled, \u201cPrivate Industry Survey.\u201d The Appendix is a\n\u201cdistillation of corporate responses to questions concerning their experience,\u201d from\n\u201cnearly a dozen Fortune 500 companies\u201d that were contacted by NACIC officers. The\nreported responses to the question, \u201cWho are the most active collectors?\u201d were \u201cChina,\nJapan, Israel, France, Korea, Taiwan, and India.\u201d On this basis, and subsequent NACIC\nstatements to the effect that \u201cthe active collectors are well known and remain the same,\u201d\nthe Government seeks administrative notice, by inference, that Israel has been\nindisputably shown to be among the most active countries in industrial espionage and\neconomic collection against the United States. This finding is not warranted. The\nIndustrial Survey report does not identify which companies were surveyed or what type\nof threat was perceived from any particular country. More tellingly, the list does not\ninclude Russia which, with China, are the only two countries named as major collectors\nin later reports. If the major collectors are as well known as the reports suggest, then\nbetter documentation of who they are should be available to Department Counsel, and\nis required to support administrative notice that any particular country is among them.\nThe Government also sought administrative notice that, \u201cIsraeli military officers\nhave been implicated in this type of technology collection in the United States.\u201d The\nrequest cites anecdotal description of a dispute involving Israeli officers monitoring\nperformance of an Israeli defense contract by a U.S. company as support for this\nassertion (AE VIII at 38.) While it is true, in a technical sense,  that such anecdotal\ndiscussion constitutes being \u201cimplicated,\u201d it does not establish the truth of the allegation\nsufficiently to support the inference that the implication itself is true. Additionally, there is\nno indication that any of Applicant\u2019s proposed classified work would be under contract\nto, or otherwise officially monitored by, the Israeli military. Accordingly, the proposed\nfact is not material to any issue in this case.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n9\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\n\n10\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;\n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that\nthe individual's access to protected information may involve unacceptable\nrisk to national security;\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which\ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation;\n(f) failure to report, when required, association with a foreign national;\n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate,\nor employee of a foreign intelligence service;\n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are\nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and,\n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make\nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\n\n11\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation;\n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or\nare approved by the cognizant security authority;\n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons,\ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and,\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not\nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations that his parents, sister, brother-in-law,\nniece, and nephew live in Israel. All of them are dual citizens of Israel and the U.S.,\nexcept his father, who is a U.S. citizen, and his brother-in-law, who is an Israeli citizen.\nApplicant and his brother are also dual citizens, but live in the U.S. The nature of\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his brother, and his brother\u2019s lifestyle, are so detached from\nany risk of influence by Israel as to raise no possible security concerns under any of the\ndisqualifying conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s other relatives living in Israel create a slight potential for exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, should the government of Israel\nchoose to act in such a manner. The risk in this case is no greater than that which is\ninherent in any situation of a relative living abroad, which is not per se disqualifying.\nWhile both Israelis and Americans in Israel could be targeted for terrorist attack, there is\nno evidence of any terrorist organization operating within Israel that would create\nheightened risk of espionage activity toward his family by virtue of their citizenship or\nresidence. There are some indications that Israel has obtained protected information\nfrom U.S. citizens, or failed to adequately protect intellectual property in the past. There\nis no evidence Israel has ever coerced, manipulated or exploited Israeli citizens or\nresidents in connection with defense or economic espionage activity directed toward\ntheir U.S.-based relatives. The close and friendly military, political and strategic relations\nbetween the U.S. and Israel would make such activity very unwise, and, considering\nIsrael\u2019s record of respecting the human rights of its citizens, quite unlikely. Applicant\u2019s\n\n12\nfamily\u2019s lack of government connection in Israel also make it unlikely that he could be\nplace in a position of having to choose between their interests and those of the U.S.\nPotential security concerns raised under AG \u00b6 7(a) are substantially mitigated under AG\n\u00b6 8(a). \nApplicant formerly had connections to Israel, including his IDF comrades, fellow\nstudents, and family members, that made him feel obliged to return and help defend\nthat nation if it came under attack. With the passage of many years, loss of contact with\nall but his close family, and increasing ties and sense of obligation to the U.S., he no\nlonger feels any such duty. He dislikes aspects of, and distrusts, the Israeli government\nand, in particular, its military hierarchy. The only people in or connected with Israel, with\nwhom he now has sufficient connections to create any possible conflict of interest, are\nhis parents, sister and her family. Other than obligated military conscriptions and his\nmother\u2019s work as a school teacher, Applicant\u2019s family has no government connection.\nLikewise, they have no independent reason to benefit from his provision of protected\ninformation to them or others in Israel. While not binding on this determination,\nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated record of successfully protecting classified and sensitive\ninformation for more than three years, shortly after the time when he said he did feel\nthat obligation toward Israel, is strong corroboration of other substantial evidence\nestablishing his integrity, trustworthiness, and determination to follow rules. Potential\nsecurity concerns raised under AG \u00b6 7(b) are substantially mitigated under AG \u00b6 8(b).\nApplicant does not have any business or financial interests in Israel, and the\npotential to inherit part of his parents\u2019 modest estate at some future date is not a point of\nvulnerability to improper influence in view of his substantial income and assets in the\nU.S. Applicant\u2019s infrequent travel to Israel issolely for purposes of visiting family there,\nwhich does not, in itself or combined with other evidence in this case, raise any security\nconcerns. Nothing about his conduct during such visits, made using his U.S. passport,\nwould make him vulnerable to exploitation or duress. Accordingly, security concerns are\nnot raised under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(e) or 7(i). The Government neither alleged nor proved facts\nraising any other foreign influence disqualifying condition. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 security concerns involving foreign preference arise because,\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country\nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember. This includes but is not limited to:\n\n13\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other\nsuch benefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business interests in\nanother country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and,\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as\nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and,\n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United\nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n\n14\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States\nGovernment.\n \nApplicant was born a U.S. citizen, and obtained dual citizenship under Israeli law\nbecause his parents moved the family from the U.S. to Israel when he was 10 years old.\nHe performed his obligatory military conscription in the IDF between ages 18 and 21.\nThereafter, he attended a government owned and operated university to obtain his\nbachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees, holding a graduate assistant teaching position with a\nstipend during the last two years. \nIn 1988, Applicant moved to the U.S. to pursue studies leading to his PhD. He\nmet and married his wife here, and has lived in the U.S. ever since. While he lived in\nIsrael, he voted in Israeli elections as a duty of citizenship there. Since moving to the\nU.S. in 1988, he has voted in every U.S. election for the same reason. He never voted\nin an Israeli election after moving to the U.S. In 1994, he indicated a willingness to\nreturn and bear arms for Israel if she were attacked, out of a lingering sense of\nobligation to his former comrades. Despite several interim Israeli military conflicts, he\nnever did so, and has lost all touch with Israelis other than his close family. He is\nexpressly no longer willing to bear arms for Israel. He did possess an Israeli passport\nwhen he moved here. It long since expired, and was never used or renewed after 1988. \nSince Applicant was born a U.S. citizen, the foregoing exercises of Israeli\ncitizenship did not occur before he was a U.S. citizen. They resulted, however, from his\nparent\u2019s decision to move him to Israel as a child. Once he fulfilled his military obligation\nthere, and finished college, he emigrated to the U.S. and has remained here since. After\nmoving here, he never again exercised any right, privilege or obligation of Israeli\ncitizenship. Instead, he diligently exercised each in connection with his U.S. citizenship. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct while he lived in Israel, from 1971 to 1988, and his 1994\nstatement implicate security concerns under all disqualifying conditions of AG \u00b6 10,\nexcept subparagraphs(a)(5) and (a)(6). All of those actions, however, arose from\nchoices made for him by his parents when he was a child, and his fulfillment of resulting\nobligations before he reached age 21. He did remain in Israel, where his family lived,\nwhile obtaining undergraduate and master\u2019s level education and working to pay his\neducational expenses. He was a dual citizen residing in Israel at the time, and exercised\nhis civic rights and obligations by voting. \nIn 1988, when Applicant had the credentials to successfully do so, he chose to\nreturn to the U.S. at age 27. Ever since, he has exercised only U.S. citizenship. He\nnever formally renounced his Israeli citizenship, but credibly expressed his willingness\nto do so. Accordingly, the security concerns raised by his conduct many years ago is\nsubstantially mitigated under AG \u00b6 11(a), (b), (c), and (e). None of the disqualifying\nconditions have existed for more than 13 years.\n \n\n15\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern under Guideline C resulted from choices made for him by his parents when he\nwas a child. Once fully emancipated and financially independent, he returned to the\nU.S. to live. He honestly expressed a willingness in 1994, that was never acted on and\nis no longer held, to return and defend Israel if attacked. Other than that statement,\nwhich was made in response to a security investigator\u2019s question, his conduct since\n1988 has been entirely that of a U.S. citizen. He successfully held a Secret clearance\nfrom 1994 through 1997, refusing even to tell his wife how many people he worked with\nbecause he thought that the information was classified. All of his foreign travel was\ndone using his U.S. passport. \nApplicant\u2019s marriage and children, his substantial local extended family, and his\nprofessional career generated his full sense of obligation as a U.S. citizen, and\neliminated any lingering sense of obligation toward Israel. His self-identity as a Jew is\nno longer grounded in any relationship with the nation of Israel, but instead arises from\nhis embrace of religion since moving back to his original home. He is very principled,\nand is a strict follower and enforcer of rules. \nAlthough his relationship with his parents and sister\u2019s family in Israel is close and\nloving, there is no evidence, other than their residence in Israel itself, to suggest\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. As discussed above, Applicant\nwould not submit to any such pressure because it would be wrong to do so, would only\ninvite more such misconduct, and would be effectively countered by bringing it to the\nattention of U.S. authorities given the nature of U.S. - Israeli relations.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence and\nforeign preference considerations. \n\n16\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Ronald C. Sykstus, Esquire\n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on May 29, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an\nadministrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this\ncase fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial\nproblems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nApril 30, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on June 22, 2007, and again on November 30,\n2007, when he formally requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on\nDecember 20, 2007. The hearing was originally scheduled for January 31, 2008, but\nwas rescheduled at Applicant\u2019s request. The hearing took place on March 13, 2008. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on March 21, 2008.\nThe record was left open until April 11, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity to\nprovide additional documentary information. Those matters were timely received and\ndepartment counsel had no objections to admissibility. The post-hearing matters are\ncollectively admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M, with parts 1 \u2013 5, which correspond to the\nparagraphs numbered 1 \u2013 5 in the cover letter. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant has a history of financial problems\nbased on an unpaid judgment for $7,018 and delinquent consumer debts ranging from\n$146 to $7,268, for a combined total of about $38,000. In his Answer to the SOR, he\ndenied the debts on the basis that they were resolved to the best of his knowledge.\nAlso, he provided a letter to explain the circumstances that led to the financial problems.\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He was recently\npromoted to the position of branch manager supporting a missile defense program. His\neducational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration (Exhibit\nC). He has worked in his current job since December 2006 (Exhibit D). His employment\nhistory includes more than two decades of active duty military service as an Army\nofficer, which ended in retirement in 2004. His performance reviews, awards, and other\ndocumentation reflect a topnotch Army officer who was highly regarded by his superiors\n(Exhibits A and B). After retiring from the Army, he worked as a federal employee until\nrelocating to his current state of residence to care for his father, who passed away in\nJune 2006 (Exhibit M, part 5). \nApplicant is married and the father of four children. Two children, young adults,\nare from his first marriage that ended in divorce in 1991, when he was awarded custody\nof the children. He married again in 1992. He and his wife also had two children.\nCurrently, three of the children are living in his household. \n\n3\nHis financial problems stem from the 2001\u20132003 period when Applicant was the\ncommanding officer of a contract agency on the west coast of the U.S. (his speciality\nwas procurement and acquisition). This position, equivalent to a battalion command,\nrequired Applicant to work long duty hours and travel away from home, to include an\noverseas deployment for several months. During this period, Applicant\u2019s wife was\ndiagnosed as suffering from depression (Tr. 80\u201383). The psychiatrist who diagnosed\nher treated her with medications such as lithium and a sleeping aid. In addition, she was\ntaking muscle relaxers and pain pills due to back problems. \nLike many military couples, Applicant\u2019s wife was primarily responsible for\nmanaging the family finances, to include bill paying, to allow Applicant to focus on his\ncareer and in light of the potential for deployment anywhere in the world. Depressed,\nshe began to miss payments and overspend with credit cards. She was under the care\nof a psychiatrist and a psychologist until she left the west coast. She has since been off\nall medications and is no longer under medical care for depression.  \nApplicant began to learn of the financial problems when he was deployed\noverseas in 2002 or 2003 when a credit-card purchase was refused. But he did not\ndiscover the full extent of the situation until about April 2004 (Tr. 40-41, 87\u201388). By that\ntime, he had completed the overseas deployment and his command tour, and he and\nhis family had returned to the east coast of the U.S. Applicant, then serving as a\nlieutenant colonel, completed a security-clearance application in August 2003 (Exhibit\n1). He disclosed no adverse or derogatory information in response to any of the several\nquestions about his financial record. He later learned the full extent of his financial\nproblems several months later in April 2004, when he was interviewed during the\nbackground investigation.  \nApplicant retired from the Army in about September 2004. He did so due to a\nhistory of back problems, which twice required surgery. The second surgery in\nDecember 2003 resulted in a prolonged recovery period when he was taking pain\nmedication. He was still having problems walking in March 2004. His treating physician\nsuggested it was best for him to retire and he followed that advice. He received a 40%\nVA disability rating based on his back problems.\nHis history of financial problems dates back to his time in the Army and is\nestablished by several credit reports (Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The debts alleged in\nthe SOR are addressed below.\nThe first debt is a judgment for $7,018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The lawsuit was brought in\nJanuary 2005, and a default judgment was obtained in March 2005 (Exhibit 3).\nApplicant and his wife believe they paid this debt (Tr. 43\u201344). But the documentary\ninformation is inconclusive. A payoff letter from the creditor (a collection agency),\naddresses a different account (Exhibit I). The series of bank payments, totaling about\n$6,000, that were made to this creditor began in April 2004 and ended in May 2005, and\nall but two of the payments predate the judgment (Exhibit M, part 2). In addition, the\njudgment appears as unresolved on the most recent credit reports from 2007 and 2008\n\n4\n(Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). Accordingly, without a satisfaction or release of\njudgment, a payoff letter, or some other conclusive documentation, the judgment for\n$7,018 is unresolved.\nThe second debt is for a collection account for $212 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). It stems from a\nmedical account that was overlooked between moves. It was paid in June 2007\n(Exhibits F and M, part 1 at 4). Accordingly, this debt is resolved. \nThe third debt is a bad debt for $567 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). A credit report indicates the\nbad debt is based on an overdraft charge or claim by a bank (Exhibit 5 at 7\u20138).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse believes the debt is based on personal property tax that was added\nto a car lease when the car was returned under the terms of the lease (Tr. 46\u201350). She\nis certain that it has been paid based on her conversations with the bank and due to the\nfact that she and Applicant have accounts with this bank (See Exhibit M, part 4).\nAccordingly, the debt is resolved.\nThe fourth debt is a bad debt for $614 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant cleared this\naccount with the creditor/bank in January 2008 (Exhibit K). The account number\nidentified in the letter appears to match the account number in the credit report (Exhibits\nK and 7 at 2). Accordingly, this debt is resolved.\nThe fifth debt is a collection account for $1,527 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). It was paid with a\npayment of $2,073 in December 2007 or January 2008 (Exhibit J). Accordingly, this\ndebt is resolved. \nThe sixth debt is a bad debt for $2,664 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). It appears to stem from a\ncredit card account that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 4; Exhibit 6 at 5). Applicant and his\nwife believe they paid this debt (Tr. 51\u201352). But the relevant document does not contain\nan account number that matches the account number in the credit reports (Tr. 67;\nExhibit K). Accordingly, this debt is unresolved.  \nThe seventh debt is a bad debt for $146 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). It appears to stem from a\ngas credit card that went into collection (Exhibit 5 at 5; Exhibit 6 at 5). Applicant\u2019s\nspouse is certain the debt was paid some time ago (Tr. 52, 67\u201368). It does not appear\non the credit reports from 2007 and 2008 (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). Accordingly,\nthis debt is resolved. \nThe eighth debt is a bad debt for $1,654 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). It appears to stem from a\ncredit card that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 6; Exhibit 6 at 6). Applicant\u2019s spouse paid\nthis through a collection agency (Tr. 53\u201354). It does not appear on the credit reports\nfrom 2007 and 2008 (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). Accordingly, this debt is resolved. \nThe ninth debt is a bad debt for $383 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). It appears to stem from a\ncredit card that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 6; Exhibit 6 at 6). This account was paid\nwith a $5,678 payment to a collection agency in November 2007 (Exhibit H).\nAccordingly, this debt is resolved. \n\n5\nThe tenth debt is a bad debt for $613 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). It appears to stem from a\ncredit card account that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 6; Exhibit 6 at 7). It was paid\nthrough a collection agency with a payment of $1,789 in May 2004 (Tr. 54; Exhibit M,\npart 2), Accordingly, this debt is resolved. \nThe 11  debt is a bad debt for $4,275 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). It appears to stem from an\nth\naccount that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 7; Exhibit 6 at 7\u20138; Exhibit M, part 1 at 3).\nAccording to the January 2008 credit report, the account was charged off as of June\n2002 with $4,275 written off when it was purchased by another lender (Exhibit M, part 1\nat 3). The account was paid off in December 2007 or January 2008 (Exhibit I). The\npayoff letter from the collection agency contains an account number that matches the\naccount number in the credit reports. The January 2008 credit report indicates the\naccount was paid to a collection agency in settlement for less than the full balance\n(Exhibit M, part 1 at 5). Accordingly, this debt is resolved.  \nThe 12  debt is a bad debt for $7,268 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). It was paid by a series of\nth\npayments to a collection agency (Tr. 55-56). The series of payments, totaling about\n$6,000, began in April 2004 and ended in May 2005 (Exhibit M, part 2). This debt does\nnot appear on the credit reports from 2007 and 2008 (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1).\nAccordingly, this debt is resolved.\nThe 13  debt is a bad debt for $6,860 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). It appears to stem from a\nth\ncredit card that was charged off (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). Applicant\u2019s spouse\nbelieves this was paid off in 2006 (Tr. 56), but Applicant did not present paperwork to\nsupport that belief (Tr. 70\u201371). The January 2008 credit report\u2014it is the most recent,\ncomplete, and understandable credit report in evidence\u2014indicates that the account was\ncharged off with a past-due balance of $6,860 as of January 2008 (Exhibit M, part 1 at\n5). Accordingly, this debt is unresolved.\nThe 14  debt is a bad debt for $4,412 (SOR \u00b6 1.n). It appears to stem from a\nth\ncredit card that was charged off (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). This account was with\nthe same creditor as SOR \u00b6 1.m. Applicant\u2019s spouse believes this debt stemmed from a\ntruck loan that they refinanced with another company, and it was paid in about August\n2007 (Tr. 56\u201357, 71, 83\u201386; Exhibit G). The documentary information does not establish\npayment of this account. Exhibit G is proof-of-payment for an auto loan, whereas the\n2007 and 2008 credit reports identify this debt as a credit card account (Exhibits 7, 8, 9,\nand M, part 1). Indeed, the January 2008 credit report indicates the account was\ncharged off with a past-due balance of $5,114 as of January 2008 (Exhibit M, part 1 at\n5). Accordingly, this debt is unresolved. \nApplicant earns an annual salary of about $106,000, which includes a pay raise\nfrom his recent promotion (Exhibits M and Exhibit M, part 3). His military retirement pay\nis about $35,000 per year (Exhibit M, part 3). In addition, he receives VA disability pay\nof about $7,640 per year (Exhibit M). In total, his 2008 annual income is estimated at\n$148,640. Applicant had about $45,000 in the bank, most of it in a savings account, as\nof April 7, 2008 (Exhibit M, part 4). \n\n Department of Navy v.

He, along with his\ntwo sisters, will receive a one-third share of the estate, which consists of a home, 150\nacres of land, life insurance proceeds, certificates of deposit, and a couple of vehicles.\nHis share could be anywhere from $200,000 to $300,000.\nApplicant takes responsibility for the financial problems. He attributes the\nproblems to being too detached, spending too much time on his career and his military\nduties and not enough time on his family responsibilities. He is now more involved with\nthe family finances, as he and his wife are discussing bills as they arrive, putting money\ninto a savings account, and planning on participating in a 401(k) account (Tr. 132\u2013133).\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n7\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history raises security concerns because it indicates inability to\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n18\n8\nsatisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n16\n17\nGuideline F. As a retired Army officer and former commanding officer, Applicant knows\nthat he is ultimately responsible for his family\u2019s finances. While the mission is of key\nimportance, living in the real world means real-world problems, including financial\nproblems. Applicant was far too detached and irresponsible in his duty\u2014as both a\nmilitary officer and husband\u2014to keep his financial house in good order. He is still a bit\ntone deaf in this regard, as evidenced by the four unresolved debts, the lack of\ncomplete documentation in this case, and by placing too much of the responsibility for\nthe finances on his wife. Taken together, these circumstances call into question\nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nThe guideline provides that certain conditions may mitigate security concerns,\nand those conditions are as follows:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.18\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, MC 1, MC 3, and MC 4 apply in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor; the others do not. The applicable MC are discussed below. \n\n9\nMC 1 applies because Applicant\u2019s financial problems began some years ago\nduring 2001\u20132003 when Applicant\u2019s wife suffered from depression, mismanaged the\nfamily finances, and Applicant was too detached to be fully aware of the situation.\nThose circumstances are unlikely to repeat because Applicant is no longer serving in\nthe Army with its demands, he is more involved in the family finances, and his wife is no\nlonger suffering from depression. The financial problems do not cast doubt on his\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment because he has resolved 10 of the\n14 debts. And he has more than sufficient means to resolve the four unresolved debts\nshould additional payments be required.\nMC 3 applies because there are clear indications that the problems are being\nresolved and are under control. He resolved 10 of the 14 debts. His current financial\ncondition is stable and under control. He has a six-figure annual income, money in the\nbank, and more money to come via the inheritance. He is not overextended nor living\nbeyond his means. His overall financial condition has measurably improved.\nMC 4 applies because he took positive steps to resolve his financial problems by\nresolving 10 of the 14 debts. Although four debts are unresolved, his actions to date are\nsufficient to qualify as a good-faith effort.\nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, this case presents both disqualifying\nand mitigating circumstances, which requires thoughtful balancing. First, Applicant is 48\nyears old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his finances, bill\npaying, and money-management practices. Second, Applicant and his wife may believe\nthey have resolved all the debts at issue in the SOR, but the record evidence is\ninconclusive. Resolving all the debts may require further payments or cleaning up a\ncredit report, but work remains and it appears Applicant is motivated to do it. And third,\nApplicant has more than two decades of honorable military service as a topnotch Army\nofficer (Exhibits A and B). This circumstance strongly suggests that he has the requisite\nself-control, good judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protest classified\ninformation. In other words, the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\nin a security-clearance context is remote. \nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant did present sufficient\nevidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. He did not present a\nperfect case in mitigation, but it is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This\ncase is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131n:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, and, 1.l of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 2.a, and 2.b of the SOR. She does not know the creditor listed in 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record, case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 59-year-old truckdriver who has worked for a defense contractor since November 2000, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance. Applicant and her husband are long haul truckers. They have recently purchased a new truck, a 2008 Peterbilt, and hope to sell the old one, a 1998 Peterbilt, worth approximately $30,000. (Tr. 125, 143) The have already found a buyer for their old truck. (Tr. 143) They pay $3,000 monthly for the truck tractor payment and $700 for the trailer. (Tr. 118) For 2004, they had $180,000 in income and $213,000 in expenses. Their adjusted gross income was a loss of $42,440. (Ex. E) During 2005, their income was $208,000 and their expenses were $191,000. Their adjusted gross income was $8,146. 3 During 2006, their income was $202,000 and their expenses were $196,000. Their adjusted gross income for the year was a loss of $2,024 after adjusting for alimony paid. (Ex.

Applicant has been making payments in accordance with repayment plans on \nthe three largest debts. Half of the debts were for medical treatment provided following \na slip and fall. One of the debts belongs to her ex-husband and she disputes two of the \nother debts. She intends to pay all she owes. Applicant has successfully mitigated \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct concerns. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on May 31, 2007, detailing the security concerns under \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMarch 11, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nGuideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial problems as \nevicenced by delinquent debts and Guideline E for personal conduct for falsified \nmaterial on a Security Clearance Applicant, Standard Form (SF) 86.  \n  \n \nOn July 9, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On December 11, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing \nscheduling the hearing held on January 15, 2008. On December 14, 2007, I was \nassigned the case. At the hearing, the government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 6, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted \nExhibits A through D, which were admitted into evidence. The record was kept open to \nallow Applicant to submit additional matters. On January 25, 2008, additional \ndocuments were received. Department Counsel did not object to the material, which \nwas then admitted into evidence as Ex. E.  On February 1, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived.  \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nOn November 1, 2007, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by \nadding three unpaid debts as \u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o and add falsification for failing to list a \npast due unpaid judgment on her SF-86 (\u00b6 2.c). Applicant had no objection to the \namending of the SOR and the motion to amend was granted. (Tr. 10-11) At the hearing, \n\u00b6 2.b was amended to delete all reference to a Diners Club debt of $4,861. Applicant \nhas never had a Diners Club account. Neither Applicant nor DC could explain the \nreference to the Diners Club debt. Applicant had not objection to the deleting of the \nreference and the motion to amend was granted. (Tr. 21-22) Applicant neither admitted \nnor denied the amended allegations. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, and, 1.l of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 2.a, and 2.b of the SOR. She does not know the creditor listed in \n1.c, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record, case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old truckdriver who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince November 2000, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance. Applicant and \nher husband are long haul truckers. They have recently purchased a new truck, a 2008 \nPeterbilt, and hope to sell the old one, a 1998 Peterbilt, worth approximately $30,000. \n(Tr. 125, 143) The have already found a buyer for their old truck. (Tr. 143) They pay \n$3,000 monthly for the truck tractor payment and $700 for the trailer. (Tr. 118)  \n \nFor 2004, they had $180,000 in income and $213,000 in expenses. Their \nadjusted gross income was a loss of $42,440. (Ex. E) During 2005, their income was \n$208,000 and their expenses were $191,000. Their adjusted gross income was $8,146. \n\n \n \n \n3\nDuring 2006, their income was $202,000 and their expenses were $196,000. Their \nadjusted gross income for the year was a loss of $2,024 after adjusting for alimony paid. \n(Ex. E) In April 2007, Applicant completed a personal financial statement listing monthly \nincome of $5,700, $3,100 in monthly expenses, and $1,000 in debt payment leaving a \nremainder of $1,600 per month. (Ex.2) Applicant believes her monthly discretional \nincome is between $100 and $200. (Tr. 150 \u2013 154). Applicant income fluctuates \ndepending on how many trips are made and how many miles are traveled each month \n \n \nFrom 1994 to 2000, Applicant was unemployed and on Social Security disability \ndue to migraine headaches and Crohn\u2019s disease. (Tr. 27, 28) Applicant\u2019s new truck, with \nbathroom facilities, allows her to resume truck driving.  \n \nIn November 2000, she returned to the work force. She informed the Social \nSecurity Administration (SSA) she had returned to work, called them 6 or 7 times to ask \nwhy she was still receiving payment, and stressed to them she did not want to be \noverpaid, because she would not have the ability to repay an overpayment. (Tr. 74, Ex. \nB) SSA informed her she was entitled to the money and had 11 months to show she \nwas still in the workforce. (Tr. 74) However, she was overpaid and the SSA is \nattempting to recover $1,650. (SOR \u00b6 1.i) When she called the SSA about the \noverpayment, SSA\u2019s records indicated Applicant had previously called about possible \noverpayment. In three years, when Applicant turns 62 and become eligible for Social \nSecurity, the amount owed will be deducted from her benefits. (Tr. 75) The SSA \ninformed her that approximately 90% of recipients are overpaid. (Tr. 77)  \n \n \nIn 1998, Applicant separated from her previous husband. In 1999, she divorced \nand remarried. Her current husband was also recently divorced.  \n \n \nShortly after returning to work, she stopped working to take care of her brother \nwho later died in April 2001. Following his death, she returned to work. In March 2003, \nshe experienced a slip and fall in a store breaking her knee cap in four places. (Tr.40) \nMedicare was paying only 80% of the medical bills. She has had numerous surgeries: in \nMarch 2003 to wire the knee together (Tr. 40), January 2004 to remove the wires, \nAugust 2004 to remove a piece of bone (Tr. 41), and August 2007 when her knee cap \nwas  surgically removed. (Tr. 41) She missed work due to the surgeries. Some of the \nmedical bills are held by a single creditor. Applicant has arranged a repayment plan with \nthis creditor.  \n \n \nApplicant had 77 therapy treatments assuming Medicare would pay 80% of the \ncost. Medicare failed to pay. The creditor has a lien against any settlement Applicant \nmay obtain from the store where she fell. Applicant\u2019s court date for the suit is in August \n2008. Mediation in the matter started on January 28, 2008. (Ex. E) Since being on \ndisability, Applicant has received Medicare coverage for her medical expenses. She \npays her premium every three months. (Tr. 88)  \n \n \nApplicant has paid two medical bills ($1,811.60 and $160) in full and has \narranged payment on two other medical bills ($1,513.79 and $142.75) through the \n\n \n \n \n4\ncollection agency. (Ex. A) The creditor indicates Applicant\u2019s payment record has been \nexcellent. She has been paying $50 on this account since she was injured in 2003. (Tr. \n139-140) Applicant was paying $250 monthly to a creditor for multiple accounts, but has \nrecently raised the monthly payment to $400. (Tr.61, 138) She has been making \npayments for more than 18 months. (Tr. 139) The balance owed is $16,115. (Tr. 46, Ex \nD) The bill started out at $20,000. (Tr. 47) A number of medical bills have been paid in \nfull.  \n \nSeven of the debts listed in the SOR are medically related. SOR \u00b6 1.c is a $134 \nmedical bill, which Applicant did not recognize until the time of the hearing. (Tr. 64) She \nintends to pay this debt. (Tr.39) SOR \u00b6 1.d is a $643 hospital bill. SOR \u00b6 1.e is two \ndebts of $48 and $267 owed a city hospital. (Tr. 64) SOR \u00b6 1.f is a $424 debt owed a \nmedical center. (Tr. 65) SOR \u00b6 1.k are three medical bills totaling $196. (Tr. 86) SOR \u00b6 \n1.l. represents 26 medical accounts totaling $7,571. SOR \u00b6 1.n is a $76 debt owed for \nradiology. Applicant hopes to use the recovery from her slip and fall case to pay these \ndebts. (Tr. 39) \n \n \n \nApplicant and her husband owed the IRS approximately $19,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) for \ntax years 2001, 2002, and 2003. (Tr. 33, Ex. 6) She is paying the IRS $500 per month \non this debt. (Ex. C) Until recently the amount was deducted through her employer, but \nsince it was a voluntary levy the amount is now paid directly by Applicant. (Tr. 34) She \nhas been making payments to the IRS for two and a half years. (Tr. 35) \n \nThe divorce decree required her ex-husband to pay the amount owed ($1,022) \non a credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g.). (Tr. 69) Applicant is unfamiliar with two debts listed \nin her credit reports; one for $428 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) and the other for $3,794 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). (Tr. \n71, 83) The $428 was the amount of high credit on the account. The balance is zero \nand the credit report indicates the account was transferred or sold. (Exs. 3, 4) The debt \nappears in the February 2007 credit report (Ex. 4), but not in the May 2007 credit report \n(Ex.5). Applicant has no knowledge about the $484 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m), and intends to \ncontact the creditor about this debt. (Tr. 90) The credit history (Ex. 4) indicates \npayments have been made on this account and $73 is past due. The credit report (Ex.3) \nlists a $68 unpaid debt (SOR \u00b6 1.o). \n \n \nThe creditor holding the $5,182 debt listed in (SOR \u00b6 1.a) reduced the debt to a \njudgment in the fall of 2003. Applicant\u2019s checking account was garnished for $149, \nwhich may or may not have been related to the judgment. (Tr. 31) The garnishment was \nstopped and the judgment remains unpaid. Applicant wishes to set up a repayment \narrangement on this debt, but has been unable to locate the creditor. (Tr. 32, Ex. 6, Ex. \nB) Applicant does not remember the reason for the judgment. Her attorney looked it up \nand brought it to Applicant\u2019s attention. It was a default judgment. (Tr. 30) \n \n \nWhen completing her SF 86, Applicant did not remember all of her creditors. \nQuestion 36 asked if any liens had been placed against her property for failing to pay \ntaxes. She answered \u201cno\u201d because she had not received a tax lien but was making \n\n \n \n \n5\nvoluntary payments to the IRS. (Tr. 98) Additionally, Applicant believed the lien had to \nbe placed against her property and she had no real estate property. (Tr. 98)  \n \nApplicant denied deliberately failing to list her debts that had ever been more \nthan 180 days delinquent, or were currently more than 90 days delinquent. (Tr. 99-100) \nThe government was concerned why six prior debts were not listed. Applicant stated \nthree of the debts were not known to her and it had been years since she had been \ncontacted by creditors. SOR \u00b6 2.b references a debt which Applicant never had and DC \nacknowledged should not have been included in her debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SF-86 was handwritten and Ex. 1 is a computer \ngenerated form. Applicant and her husband are long-haul over the road truck drivers.  \nAs such, there are periods of time when they are gone from their home for extended \nperiods. At one point during the security clearance application, Applicant was sent \npaperwork and she was not home for almost three months to receive the paperwork. \n(Tr. 29)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n \n \n6\n                                                          \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed more than $41,000 to 14 creditors. One of the debts was \n \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \n7\nreduced to judgment. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial problems \nwere contributed to by numerous surgeries and medical treatment related to her slip \nand fall that destroyed her knee cap. Seven of the debts, totaling more than $9,000, are \nfor medical bills. Applicant pays premiums for Medicare coverage and assumed \nMedicare would pay for her 77 treatments. The mediation process has recently started \non this slip and fall case. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant lost time from work caring for her brother prior to his death \nand because of her migraine headaches and Crohn\u2019s disease. The restrictions imposed \non her job as a truck driver by her Crohn\u2019s disease have been lessened by the \nbathroom facilities on the new truck. The medical bills resulting from the slip and fall, the \ntime lost from work caring for her brother, and the restrictions on her work imposed by \nCrohn\u2019s disease are not likely to recur because of the facilities in the new truck. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) applies. \n \nAG & 20(b), Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,@ applies. Applicant experienced an \nunexpected medical emergency and caring for her brother along with the financial \nburden associated with each. She has paid what she was able to on her debts. AG & \n20(b) applies. \n \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has paid a \nnumber of the medical bills. She has been making $250 monthly payments, recently \nraised to $400, to one creditor for more than 18 months. She has been making $50 \nmonthly payments on other medical bills since March 2004, approximately 4 years. She \nhas been voluntarily paying the IRS $500 per month for more than two and a half years. \nAdditionally, the debt ($1,022) listed in SOR & 1.g. is her ex-husband\u2019s debt. AG & \n20(b) applies to these four obligations.  \n \n \nThe SSA overpaid Applicant $1,650 in disability payments. Applicant acted \nreasonably in attempting to avoid overpayment. She called the SSA and told them she \nhad returned to work and they assured her she was entitled to the payments. She \nintends to allow SSA to take the amount owed from her benefits when she starts \nreceiving payment in three years. This may not be the best way to handle the \noverpayment, but one can only do so much with the funds available.  \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n \nApplicant wants to arrange payment on the $5,000 judgment. She also owes four \nadditional debts: $ 68 (SOR \u00b6 1.o), $428 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), $484 (SOR \u00b6 1.m), and $3,794 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j). Should their old truck sell or should she receive settlement on the slip and \nfall case, these amounts could easily be paid. If there is no sale or settlement, Applicant \nhas arranged payments with other creditors in the past and her long history of payments \nindicates her creditors will be paid. These five additional debts do not raise concerns \nabout her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe allegations under Guideline E, (Personal Conduct) are refuted. The \nGovernment has shown Applicant's answers to questions 37, 38 and 39 were incorrect, \nbut this does not prove the Applicant deliberately failed to disclose information about her \nfinances. The Applicant has denied intentional falsification. In July 2004, when \ncompleting her SF 86, Applicant did not list any debts as having ever been more than \n180 days delinquent or being currently more than 90 days delinquent. At the time she \ncompleted her SF 86, she was making payments on three of the obligations. Applicant \ndoes not recognize three other creditors and was not being called or contacted by any \ncreditors. A default judgment was obtained against Applicant, but Applicant was \nunaware of the judgment until her attorney looked it up. Applicant was not receiving any \ncalls or correspondence from the creditors and had simply forgot about the debts when \nshe completed her SF-86 \n \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance \nis a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification \nmust be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. An \nomission concerning delinquent debt is not deliberate if the person did not know of their \nexistence or failed to remember them. The Applicant was unaware of the default \njudgment and did not know her accounts were delinquent when completing her SF 86. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s job took her away from home for months at a time, thereby \nlimiting her access to her mail. \n \nI found Applicant\u2019s explanation of her negative answers on her SF 86 plausible. \nAfter hearing her testimony, observing her demeanor, and evaluating all the evidence of \nrecord, I found her testimony credible on the falsification issue. I am satisfied she did \nnot intentionally falsify her SF 86.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n \n9\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntype that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The debts set forth in the SOR were \nnot incurred on luxuries. The majority were for medical treatment and taxes. \n \nApplicant is making monthly payments on three of the largest of her debts. These \ndebts cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Applicant is addressing those \ndebts she can. There are debts she is currently unable to address. The issue is not \nsimply whether all her debts are being paid\u2014it is whether her financial circumstances \nraise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a) (1)) \nApplicant is paying those bills that she can and has been doing so for a number of \nyears. The length of time she has been making payments gives me confidence she will \ncontinue to make payment until these debts are paid. Once the debts are paid she will \nwork to pay off the remaining obligations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.o: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a- 2.c: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n10\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 18, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Jacqueline T.\nWilliams denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.1\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that: (a) Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness had resulted from circumstances beyond his control\u2014a divorce and serious medical\nproblems, and (b) Applicant has been in the process of consolidating his debts and filing for a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy.  In support of his argument, Applicant provides documentation updating his\nfinancial situation, and attesting to his good character and work performance.  Part of this submission\nrelates to debts cited in SOR paragraphs which were resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor and are not at\nissue on appeal.  With respect to the balance of Applicant\u2019s submission, his arguments do not\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had delinquent debts and was still\nin the process of resolving his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome all the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\n\n3\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n4, 2007).  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance\ndecision under Guidelines F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

B (Notice of Final Payment or Suspension of Compensation Payments).\n3\nTr. at 22.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 17, 2006, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation\nProcessing.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security\n1\nclearance, and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  on May 25, 2007, detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nBy letter dated June 26, 2007, Applicant, through counsel, responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing. Department Counsel indicated the case was ready to proceed on July 31,\n2007. This case was assigned to me on August 3, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August\n6, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 30, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At\nthe hearing, the Government submitted exhibits 1-8, and Applicant submitted exhibits A-H, all of\nwhich were admitted into the record without objection. The record was left open to give Applicant\ntime to submit additional documents. Applicant submitted two additional documents. The documents\nwere identified as exhibits I and J and admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received\non September 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.c, 1.e-1.h, and 1.j.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record,\nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 54 years old and has worked as a rigger for a defense contractor since 1973. He\nleft school after completing the eighth grade. He is divorced and has two adult children, ages 25 and\n22.\nOn January 9, 2001, Applicant injured his left shoulder on the job and had surgery in March\n2004. After surgery, he filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim. He received a total of $18,110.18 in\nbenefits for the period March 12, 2004 through September 26, 2004.  He was out of work for about\n3\nsix months.4\n\nEx. A (Notice of Final Payment or Suspension of Compensation Payments).\n5\nTr. at 22.\n6\nEx. D (Judgment Information).\n7\nEx.

He filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim and received a total of $13,578.47\nin benefits for the period November 19, 2004 through April 24, 2005.  He was out of work for about\n5\nsix months.6\nThe SOR lists that Applicant has 12 delinquent and outstanding debts totaling approximately\n$27,765. He proffered evidence of paying two debts, totaling $2,270. A 2003 judgment against him\nwas paid on March 24, 2006 (SOR 1.b).  A debt for a television account for $48 (SOR 1.f) was paid\n7\non August 29, 2007. The SOR listed that he was 120 days delinquent on a mortgage valued at\n$112,000 (SOR 1.i). At the hearing, he testified that he deeded this property to his ex-wife, once he\nbecame delinquent on the mortgage payments. The loan was paid in full on June 30, 2006.8\nApplicant is contemplating filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. During the last two\nmonths, he has had appointments with his attorney to review his financial situation.  His attorney\n9\nsuggested that Applicant file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, and he would be obligated to repay\na portion of all of his delinquent debts based on his income.10\nApplicant has nine delinquent debts outstanding, totaling approximately $25,495. Applicant\nindicated he has no knowledge of a debt for $1,707 (SOR 1.a).  He indicated his bankruptcy\n11\nattorney will assist him in tracking what this debt represents.  He indicated that a bill for $147 (SOR\n12\n1.c) for a delinquent television account would be paid the day after the hearing.  He denied owing\n13\n$2,093 (SOR 1.d) on a delinquent account.  A telephone bill for $232 (SOR 1.e) may be paid off\n14\nby him or it might be included in his bankruptcy.  He owes $470 (SOR 1.g) on a telephone account,\n15\nand this debt will be included in the bankruptcy.  He owes $9,157 (SOR 1.h) on a car he purchased\n16\nin 2006. After lending the car to his girlfriend, it was in an accident that incurred $7,000 worth of\ndamages. After the car was repaired, the insurance company dropped him and he returned the car to\n\nTr. at 49-50.\n17\nTr. at 57-58.\n18\nTr. at 59.\n19\nTr. at 60.\n20\nTr. at 97.\n21\nTr. at 64.\n22\nTr. at 62.\n23\nEx.

The car was to be auctioned by the dealer but he never heard\nfrom them.  An account with a collection agency for another car was charged off for $2,385 (SOR\n17\n1.j).  Applicant stated that car debt arose when he had heart surgery, and he had no money to make\n18\npayments. He is indebted to a collection agency on an account totaling $9,120 (SOR 1.k). He\nbelieves this debt duplicates the debt for $9,157 (SOR 1.h).  If he finds out that this is a separate\n19\ndebt, he will include it as part of his bankruptcy.  He believes that a debt for $184 (SOR 1.l) does\n20\nnot belong to him and it might duplicate the debt for $147 (SOR 1.c).\nApplicant has a child support order, which is paid through payroll deduction. He is about\n$1,600 in arrears.  Through March 15, 2006, he paid $250 a week for child support and that amount\n21\nwas reduced to $25 on March 22, 2006.  A reduction in child support occurred because his son lived\n22\nwith him for a year and a half, and he continued to pay the full amount for child support.  When the\n23\namount was recalculated, his payment was reduced. His son is now 22 years old.\nApplicant proffered seven letters of recommendation from his coworkers.  They all think\n24\nthat he is a reliable, trustworthy, and dependable worker.\nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is approximately $43,680.  He does not own a vehicle. He has\n25\nabout $100 in a savings account.  Although he has a retirement account, he is not certain how much\n26\nit is worth.  For the past seven months, Applicant has been working seven days a week.  He stated\n27\n28\nthat working this hard enables him to financially assist his children and girlfriend.29\nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n30\nId. at 527.\n31\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n32\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n33\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n34\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n35\n5\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n30\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n31\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n32\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n33\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n34\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.35\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems. \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18)\nApplicant has a long history of financial problems going back to 2003, when two judgments\nwere entered against him. In 2003, a judgment was entered against him for $2,222. In 2006, he paid\n\n6\nthe judgment. He indicated that he has no knowledge of what the judgment filed in 2003 for $1,707\nrepresents. Moreover, he has other debts totaling $25,495 that are still delinquent and outstanding.\nAccordingly, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Applicant had heart\nsurgery in 2000, and received short-term disability payments for the three months he was recovering\nand out of work. In March 2004, he had surgery on his left shoulder, due to a job-related injury. He\nreceived $18,110.18 in worker\u2019s compensation benefits for the period March 12, 2004 through\nSeptember 26, 2004. In November 2004, he had surgery on his right shoulder for an on-the-job injury.\nSubsequently, he received $13,578.47 in worker\u2019s compensation benefits for the period November\n19, 2004 through April 24, 2005. He was out of work for about one year, six months for each surgery.\nHowever, his surgeries in 2000 and 2004 can no longer be used as legitimate reasons for his unhealthy\nfinancial situation. I conclude that Applicant was financially compensated for his surgeries by short-\nterm disability and worker\u2019s compensation payments, albeit, he did not earn his full salary but he did\nhave an income and could have made arrangements with his creditors if his income was limited.\nConsequently, Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply.\nApplicant has not taken his financial responsibilities seriously. This is evidenced by the\nlimited payments he made on the debt listed in the SOR. He paid a $48 debt on August 29, 2007.\nMoreover, he indicated that a debt for $147 would be paid the day after the hearing. Other debts\nremain unpaid and he plans to include them in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Although he is being\ncounseled on his finances, the record reveals that he sought counseling about two months before the\nhearing. Whatever progress he has made has been slow and not results oriented by the hearing date.\nConsequently, \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or is\nunder control) and \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) do not apply.\nI now turn to the general factors of the whole person concept. I applaud Applicant for securing\na job that provided a good career without completion of a high school education. Applicant has a\nsluggish  approach to handling his finances. A 2003 judgment was paid in 2006. A debt for $48 was\nnot paid until August 2007. For the past seven months, he has been working seven days a week.\nRather than make payments on his outstanding debts, he is giving his money to his children and\ngirlfriend, which enhances their financial coffers rather than his. As a remedial fix, he has been\npondering filing bankruptcy. However, he is slowly trying to deal with his finances, and it is\nquestionable as to whether he will ever pay his delinquent debts. For the reasons stated, I conclude\nApplicant is not suitable for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\n\n7\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

MALONE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nAlison O\u2019Connell, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nSecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial problems are mitigated by recent actions\nto pay or resolve his debts. However, he was unable to mitigate security concerns about a lengthy\nrecord of arrests for assault and restraining order violations. Clearance is denied.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 19, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance needed for his current employment with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance.\n1\nOn June 29, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise\nsecurity concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines  under Guideline F (financial\n2\nconsiderations) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\nme on September 4, 2007, and I convened a hearing on September 25, 2007, at which the parties\nappeared as scheduled. Without objection, I admitted 11 exhibits offered by the government (Gx.\n1- 11). Applicant testified in his own behalf, and offered five exhibits, which were admitted without\nobjection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - E. I also left the record open to receive additional\ninformation from Applicant. The record closed on October 3, 2007, when I received Applicant\u2019s\npost-hearing submission, which I admitted without objection as Ax. F. DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) the same day.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.e -\n2.j. His admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the pleadings,\ntranscript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 45 years old and requires a security clearance for his work for a defense\ncontractor as a security guard at a classified government facility. In 1981, Applicant enlisted in the\nArmy National Guard, but transferred to active enlisted duty in the United States Navy later that\nyear. In February 2002, he retired from active duty as a petty officer first class (paygrade E-6). At\nthe time of his discharge, he had several medical problems, including diabetes, for which he receives\na 40% disability payment in addition to his retirement pay. \nAfter leaving the Navy in 2002, Applicant enrolled in training for long-distance truckers. He\nworked for a trucking company from July 2002 until December 2002, when he was forced to leave\nhis job. His diabetes had worsened to the point where he had to take insulin injections, a condition\nthat made it unsafe to drive long distances. From 2003 until May 2004, Applicant held a variety of\nfull- and part-time jobs, but he was unemployed between December 2002 and May 2003, between\nJuly 2003 and October 2003, and between September 2006 and November 2006. (Gx. 1) He was\n\n3\nhired for his current job in October 2006, but did not actually start working there until December\n2006.\nApplicant\u2019s tuition for his truck driving school was paid directly out of his paycheck as long\nas he worked for the company that ran the school. When he lost his job due to illness, he was unable\nto keep up with the payments. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, by March 2007, he owed the school about\n$7,800 in unpaid tuition and interest. However, he reached an agreement with the collection agency\nto whom the debt was referred, whereby he has been paying $200 each month since May 2006. (Ax.\nF)\nAlso as a result of his loss of income, Applicant was unable to meet his monthly mortgage\npayments. In July 2004, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, his $123,000 mortgage was foreclosed and he lost\nhis house. In September 2004, the house was subsequently sold by the bank for $226,000. Applicant\nand his second ex-wife received proceeds from the sale. Applicant owes nothing on this debt and his\nVA home loan eligibility has been restored. However, the foreclosure still appears on his credit\nhistory report. (Answer to SOR; Ax. B)\nIn 2005, Applicant also became delinquent on his homeowners\u2019 association dues. As alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 1.b, the association obtained a civil judgment against Applicant to collect a $267 debt. This\ndebt was paid in full as of April 2007. (Ax. E)\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems caused him to seek Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in June\n2003. He declared approximately $19,000 in debts to be paid over 45 months at $423 each month.\nHowever, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, by September 2004, Applicant had not yet found steady work, and\nthe bankruptcy was dismissed for non-payment.\nApplicant has been married twice. Both marriages ended in divorce. He was married to his\nfirst wife from April 1984 until November 1997. His second marriage lasted from August 1998 until\nJuly 2004, however, they had separated in July 2002. Applicant has two children by women to whom\nhe was never married. His oldest child was born in 1992, while he was married to his first wife.\nAnother child was born in February 1999, after Applicant married his second wife. He did not know\nof the child until January 2005, when a blood test identified him as the child\u2019s father. On or about\nOctober 19, 2005, he was ordered to pay $514.60 each month for child support. Because the order\nwas retroactive to the date he was identified as the father, he was ordered to pay an additional\n$109.50 each month to make up the arrearage. The child and his mother live in a different state than\nApplicant. Applicant has paid each month as required to the state where he lives, but the child\u2019s state\nhas reported him as delinquent in paying the support. Despite the SOR \u00b6\u00b61.d and 1.e allegations that\nApplicant is late in paying two different child support orders, he is only subject to one order and he\nhas paid it each month as ordered. As of the hearing, the arrearage had been reduced to about $360.\n(Ax. D)\nBoth of Applicant\u2019s marriages were contentious. Several times, arguments with his wives\nturned physical and Applicant was arrested and/or charged with assault or assault and battery at least\neight times between 1984 and 2002. Applicant claims he was subject to criminal prosecution solely\nbecause his wives would file baseless charges against him after one of their many arguments.\n\n4\nMost of Applicant\u2019s arrests occurred during his first marriage. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, he\nwas charged with assault in June 1984 after an argument with his wife. That charge was entered as\nnolle prosequi. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, he was charged with assault in October 1984 after an\nargument with his wife. That charge was later dismissed. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c, he was charged\nwith three counts of assault and one count of disorderly conduct in November 1984, after an\nargument with his wife. The assault charges stemmed from his actions while resisting arrest by\npolice officers called to his house. At trial, he was acquitted of the assault charges, but convicted of\ndisorderly conduct and fined. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d, Applicant was charged with assault in\nSeptember 1986, but that charge was entered as nolle prosequi. In April 1991 and July 1991, as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.f, respectively, he was charged with assault and battery on his first wife.\nHe was convicted of and given a suspended 30-day jail sentence for each offense. Finally, in August\n1992, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g, Applicant and his wife got into another fight during which he\nassaulted her and took her car keys. He was acquitted of a petit larceny charge, but convicted of\nassault and battery. (Gx. 6 - 8)\nApplicant has denied that he did anything to his first wife other than grab her to keep her\nfrom hitting or pushing him. However, a 1994 written statement he gave as part of a subject\ninterview with the Defense Investigative Service during an earlier background investigation, he\nacknowledged his wife twice went to the hospital after they fought \u2013 once for a broken nose and once\nafter his knee hit her in the eye. (Gx. 9) \nIn June 2002, an argument between Applicant and his second wife escalated into physical\nviolence. The couple separated in July 2002 after she filed a charge against him of assault and battery\non a family member. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.h, Applicant was convicted and sentenced to 30 days\nin jail, which was apparently suspended. In connection with this incident, Applicant was ordered to\nhave no contact with Applicant. However, in November 2002, he sent his estranged second wife a\nletter while he was on the road. This constituted a violation of the no contact order, for which, as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.i, he was charged and convicted of a misdemeanor violation of a protective order.\nHe was given a six-month suspended jail sentence. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.j, in April 2003, Applicant\nwas arrested after he sent his second wife a Valentine\u2019s Day card, another violation of the no-contact\norder. This time, he was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $125. (Gx. 1 and 8)\nIn June 1993, Applicant referred himself to psychiatric care at a Naval hospital because he\nfeared he was losing control and had thought of killing his wife. Records of the treatment refer to\nhis history of spousal abuse and an incident in the previous year when he severely beat her after\nfinding her in bed with another man. After a weekend of observation and evaluation, Applicant was\ndiagnosed with an adjustment disorder and borderline narcissistic or dependent traits. He and his\nwife were referred to marital counseling and Applicant continued to receive counseling for stress\nmanagement. Applicant and his first wife also attended several court-ordered counseling sessions\nas a condition of dismissals or suspended jail sentences. (Gx. 10)\nApplicant served honorably in the Navy.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination\nbased on examination of all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.  Decisions must\n3\nalso reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or\n4\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against\nan applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to\nclassified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties at\nhearing require that the security concerns addressed in Revised Adjudicative Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline J (criminal conduct) be applied.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n5\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n6\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Consideration. Under Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n8\n \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d \n9\n \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d\n10\n \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n11\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d\n \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\n12\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances;\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 30.\n13\n6\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  The\n8\ngovernment presented sufficient information to support the allegations of delinquent debt in the\nSOR. Available information shows Applicant failed to meet his repayment obligations through his\n2003 Chapter 13 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that he failed to pay his homeowners association dues\nresulting in a civil judgement against him (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that he became delinquent on the tuition\nfor his truck. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) The record further shows Applicant was listed as being in arrears on\nmonthly child support payments in two different states (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e), and that his $123,000\nmortgage was foreclosed. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) The foregoing requires consideration of Guideline F\ndisqualifying conditions 19(a)  and 19(c).\n9\n10\nThe record also requires consideration of Guideline F mitigating conditions 20(a)  and\n11\n20(b).  After leaving the Navy in 2002, Applicant had found work as a truck driver but was unable\n12\nto pay his tuition because he lost his job due to illness. Unemployment and under employment over\nthe next two years left him unable to keep up with several debts and he filed for bankruptcy\nprotection. However, his employment prospects continued to hamper his obligations under the\npetition. However, Applicant presented sufficient information to show he has paid the homeowners\nassociation judgment (Ax. E), that he has been repaying the tuition debt since before the SOR was\nissued (Ax. C and F), and that there was no debt remaining after the foreclosure of his mortgage (Ax.\nB). As to his child support obligations, the information he submitted shows there is only one state\nto which he is paying support, and the only reason he had an arrearage was because about 10 months\nelapsed between the paternity test results and a court order was issued defining Applicant\u2019s\nobligation. He has never missed a payment and the arrearage in question is nearly paid off. \nAvailable information shows Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due largely to\ncircumstances beyond his control and that he has made sufficient progress in paying or otherwise\nresolving his debts. It is unlikely he will incur such delinquencies in the future, and I resolve this\nguideline for the Applicant.\nCriminal Conduct. Under Guideline J, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  The government presented sufficient\n13\ninformation to support the allegations that he was arrested and charged with criminal offenses ten\ntimes between 1984 and 2003 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j. The government\u2019s information,\n\n \u201c a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d\n14\n \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\n15\nprosecuted or convicted;\u201d\n Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery of his girlfriend\n16\nwhen he was 16 years old. (Gx. 9) This information is relevant to the entire record of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct.\n Applicant repeatedly claimed his wives misrepresented what happened and that he did not intentionally hurt\n17\nhis either wife. I did not believe his claims in this regard, especially in view of the contents of Gx. 9 and 10, which show\nthat, despite his claims to the contrary, Applicant injured his first wife by assaulting her at least twice. \n \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n18\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\u201d\n \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\n19\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\u201d\n See footnote 4, supra.\n20\n7\nalong with Applicant\u2019s admissions, further showed Applicant was convicted of criminal charges after\nthree of those arrests, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.e through 1.j. As a result of his arrests in 2002\nand 2003 for violating terms of his sentence for a July 2002 assault on his second wife, Applicant\nspent 30 days in jail. All of the foregoing requires consideration Guideline J disqualifying condition\n(DC) 31(a)  and DC 31(c).  \n14\n15\nBy way of mitigation, Applicant failed to meet his burden of showing the available\ninformation about his criminal conduct is no longer of security concern. He has not been involved\nin criminal conduct since 2003. However, his record of such behavior spans two marriages over 20\nyears and includes a similar offense as a juvenile.  Under other circumstances, four years of good\n16\nconduct may be sufficient to show rehabilitation and to indicate he may not engage in such conduct\nin the future. But given the  length of time over which the conduct occurred, and the fact Applicant\nhas yet to acknowledge his wrongdoing and accept responsibility for his actions,  there is no support\n17\nfor consideration of  Guideline J mitigating condition 32(a)  or 32(d).  I conclude this guideline\n18\n19\nagainst the Applicant.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines F and J. I have also reviewed the\nrecord before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  I place great emphasis on the fact that Applicant served his country for\n20\nover 20 years. However, there is no other information available regarding his work record since\nleaving the military. I have also considered the adverse circumstances presented by his illness and\nemployment difficulties. Applicant is a mature adult with significant life experience. To his credit,\nhe responsibly addressed his financial problems; but his tendency to resort to physical violence to\nresolve personal disputes is a well-documented lifelong problem that casts doubt on his judgment\nand willingness or ability to follow rules and abide by basic norms of social behavior. Appellant\npresented no information to suggest his conduct has been addressed sufficiently so that it will not\n\n See footnote 7, supra.\n21\n See footnote 3, supra.\n22\n8\nrecur. Indeed, his lack of insight into his conduct and his continued minimization of his conduct\nserve only to buttress the government\u2019s doubts about his judgment. Such doubts must be resolved\nin favor of the national security.  A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information\n21\n22\nbefore me shows that the Applicant has not yet overcome the government\u2019s reasonable doubts about\nhis ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and\ndiscretion expected of one who holds a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.f:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):         \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.j:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 13,\n2006. On August 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\n1\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 27, 2007.  He answered\n2\nthe SOR in writing on September 21, 2007, and requested that his case be decided by\nJanuary 16, 2008\n\nItem 4.\n3\nThe government submitted eight items in support of the allegations.\n4\nItem 6 at 4.\n5\nItem 5 at 35-36 of 37.\n6\nItem 4 at 3.\n7\n2\nan Administrative Judge on the written record without a hearing.  Department Counsel\n3\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on October 22, 2007. A complete copy of the\nfile of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an\n4\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.\nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM on\nOctober 30, 2007, and returned it to DOHA. He provided no further response to the\nFORM within the 30-day period he was given to do so, did not request additional time to\nrespond, and made no objection to consideration of any evidence submitted by\nDepartment Counsel. I received the case assignment on December 13, 2007. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. From March 1984 to\nMarch 2004, he served on active duty in the U.S. Navy, retiring at pay grade E-6. He is\nmarried, with one child living at home and another who lives with his former wife. His\npersonal financial statement, dated April 5, 2007, reflects about $73,000 in equity in his\nhome and $2,400 in monthly surplus of family income over expenses.5\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 21, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and 1.I of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, and 1.h of the SOR. He provided additional\nexplanations to support his denials concerning most of those allegations.  \nThe three delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e involved credit\ncard balances with two retailers and a bank that were charged-off between 2001 and\n2003, while Applicant was still in the Navy. He does not deny that he owed the original\ncreditors these amounts. In fact, he listed two of these three accounts as delinquencies\nin response to question 28a on his security clearance application.  In his SOR\n6\nresponse, he acknowledges the existence of the original debts, but claims that the\nabsence of written contracts with the debt collection services to whom the debts were\nassigned absolves him of any duty to pay them.  The total amount of these three debts\n7\nis $11,312.\nApplicant denied owing the delinquent cell phone debt alleged in \u00b6 1.b, without\nany explanation. This $476 debt appears on all three credit bureau reports (CBRs) in\n\nItem 6 at 12; Item 7 at 1; Item 8 at 6.\n8\nItem 5 at 9 of 37; Item 6 at 11; Item 8 at 12.\n9\n3\nthe FORM.  This account first became delinquent in August 2001, and was assigned for\n8\ncollection in March 2005.  The three delinquent debts, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and\n1.I, to which Applicant admitted, total $292 and comprise two electric bills and a medical\nco-pay. All three also became delinquent while Applicant was serving in the Navy.\nApplicant provided no evidence of payment or other resolution concerning any of these\ndebts.\nApplicant stated that he paid the $38 cable-service bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He\ndid not provide proof of payment, but the debt does not appear on either of the two 2007\nCBRs in the FORM, which is consistent with his claim. He also denied the $38\ndelinquent natural gas bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, explaining that he did not live in the\nstate at the time the debt allegedly arose in August 2003. The evidence supports this\ndenial, since he was living in another state from September 2000 through January 2004\nduring his final tour of naval duty.9\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n4\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under\nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt during his final years of\nactive naval service, was apparently unable to pay some obligations for a period of time,\nand has been unwilling to repay significant debts after becoming able to do so.\nExcluding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.h, which were not established,\nApplicant demonstrated no effort to resolve any of the remaining $12,080 of proven\ndelinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination and balancing of resulting security concerns\nwith any potentially mitigating matters.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\n\n5\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial\nissues first arose between about 2000 and 2002, while he was in the Navy. Since 2004,\nhis combined military retirement pay and other family income has been sufficient to\nrepay these debts. However, he has not done so. He has not incurred any recent\nadditional delinquencies, but the old debts remain unpaid to date. His disregard of these\nfinancial obligations is ongoing, and continues to raise concerns about his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence does not support this\npotentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, even if\nsome of the financial problems arose from his former inability to pay all his bills from his\nNavy pay, his more recent employment generated sufficient funds to permit resolution of\nhis outstanding obligations. He chose not to act responsibly in identifying and resolving\nthese debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not supported as a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant neither asserted nor provided evidence of either of\nthese conditions, except with respect to the $38 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. I conclude\nthese potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nApplicant has the current means to address and resolve the delinquent debts\nestablished by the Government. He has neither done so, nor expressed any intention to\ndo so, even after receiving notice of the security concerns raised by these issues. This\ndoes not support an inference that he is now financially overextended and, therefore, at\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. It does, however, indicate a\nlack of judgment and unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, thereby raising\nsubstantial questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to safeguard\nclassified information.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\n\n6\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these financial problems\narose, Applicant was in the final years of a twenty-year naval career. He provided no\ninformation to show that any of these debts arose due to circumstances largely beyond\nhis control. Applicant has secured lucrative employment for the past several years, with\nthe means to resolve his delinquent debts should he choose to do so. He has chosen\nnot to resolve them without valid justification. There is no evidence of rehabilitation or\npermanent behavioral change. While risk of coercion or duress is not significant, his\nongoing disregard of lawful obligations, especially after receiving notice of the security\nconcerns raised thereby, creates continuing doubt about his trustworthiness and\nreliability. He offered no other evidence to mitigate these concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has\nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nSecurity concerns are raised under the drug involvement and personal conduct guidelines\npertaining to Applicant's history of illegal marijuana use, including while holding a security\nclearance.  He did not intentionally falsify his answers to interrogatories provided to the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals, on June 7, 2007. He has not met his burden to mitigate the other\nsecurity concern raised under personal conduct and the concerns raised under drug involvement.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n Item 4.\n2\n Item 3. \n3\n Item 3 (Aside from his admissions, there is nothing in the record evidence pertaining to his marijuana use from\n4\n1985 to 1995). \n Item 3. \n5\n Item 7. \n6\n2\nOn July 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29,\n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. \nOn August 7, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  Applicant elected to have\nhis case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file of\nrelevant material (FORM) on September 6, 2007. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on September\n12, 2007 and received by him on September 18, 2007.  Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant timely responded\non October 16, 2007. Department Counsel had no objection to Applicant's response. The case was\nassigned to me on November 2, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 41-year-old production manager employed with a defense contractor since July\n1995. He is married and has a nine-year-old son.  He admits to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b,\n2\n1.c and 2.a, and  denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b.3\nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use.  In his answer to the SOR, he admits to using\nmarijuana on a monthly basis from 1985 to 1995.   He admits to using marijuana on at least 10\n4\noccasions between January 2000 to December 2005.  He admits that his use of marijuana between\nJanuary 2000 to December 2005, occurred after he was granted a Confidential security clearance.5\nIn April 1988, he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and hashish for sale, and\nfireworks without a permit. He was convicted of the offense of fireworks without a permit and fined\n$980.6\nOn September 8, 2006, Applicant submitted a questionnaire for sensitive positions, Standard\nForm 86. In response to question 24a which asked Applicant whether he used any illegal drugs\nwithin the past seven years, he answered, \"Yes\" and listed that he used marijuana on an estimated\n\n Item 4. \n7\n Item 4, questions 23B and 23D. \n8\n Item 5, question 1. \n9\n Item 5, question 3. \n10\n Item 3. \n11\n Item 5, question 2. \n12\n Response to FORM, dated October 16, 2007.\n13\n Response to FORM, Performance Appraisals for the periods October 1998 to October 1999, December 2000\n14\nto December 2001, January 2004 to December 2004, November 2004 to November 2005, and November 2005 to\nNovember 2006. \n3\n10 occasions between January 2000 to December 2005.  He answered \"Yes\" in response to question\n7\n23B which asked whether he had ever been arrested for, charged with Firearms/Explosives Charge\nand in response to question 23D which asked whether he had ever been arrested or charged with\nalcohol or drug offenses. He listed his 1988 arrest and charge for possession of marijuana and\nfireworks without a permit.  He also listed a 1990 reckless driving offense.8\nOn June 7, 2007, Applicant responded to Interrogatories sent by the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals. Question one asked \"Have you used any narcotic, depressant, stimulant,\nhallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP) and/or any Cannabis (to include marijuana and hashish),\nexcept prescribed by a licensed physician?\" Applicant answered, \"Yes\" and listed that he used\nmarijuana approximately two times a year from 2000 to December 12, 2005. The average quantity\nof marijuana used was 1/2 teaspoon. He does not intend to use marijuana in the future.   Question\n9\n3 asked \"When did you start using marijuana?\" Applicant answered, \"As stated in the questionnaire\ndated September 8, 2006, January 2000 estimated.\"   \n10\nApplicant did not list his marijuana use from 1985 to 1995 in his response to the\ninterrogatories. He did not list his earlier marijuana use on the interrogatory because he believed that\nhe only had to go back seven years. He had no intent to falsify his security clearance application.11\nApplicant indicated that he purchased marijuana for personal use. On occasion, he would\nsmoke marijuana with his wife. Other times, he would smoke it alone. He used marijuana to help\nhim quit smoking tobacco. He stopped using marijuana as the urge to smoke tobacco declined and\nalso to become a good role model for his son.12\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant states that he has worked for his employer for over\n20 years. He provided several copies of his performance appraisals and indicated that he had been\npromoted four times during his career. He regrets the choices he made in the past. He chose to tell\nthe truth during this inquiry. He no longer uses marijuana and has no intention of using marijuana\nin the future.  The performance appraisals that Applicant submitted were favorable.\n13\n14\n\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). \n15\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 24. \n16\n Revised AG, dated Augsut 2006, \u00b615. \n17\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2.\n18\n Id.\n19\n4\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \"the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\"  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n15\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive and the revised AGs, effective September 1, 2006.  The revised AGs set\nforth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement:  Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.16\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.17\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\"   An administrative\n18\njudge must apply the \"whole person concept,\" and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n19\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n\n Id.\n20\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n21\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n22\n Directive \u00b6 E.2.2.2; Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n23\n AG, \u00b6 24(b).\n24\n5\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n20\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be\na fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a). \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n21\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.22\n\u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security\nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n23\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline H and Guideline E.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nApplicant's past drug abuse raises a security concern. Drug abuse is defined as \"the illegal use\nof a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\"24\nApplicant admits to using marijuana on a monthly basis from August 1985 to 1995.  He used\nmarijuana approximately ten times between January 2000 to December 2005, after being granted a\nsecurity clearance in July 1996. \n\n6\nThe following Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) apply to Applicant's case.\nDI DC \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse) applies due to his past history of illegal marijuana use. DI DC \u00b6 25(c)\n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) applies.  Applicant possessed and purchased\nmarijuana on several occasions.  DI DC \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance) applies.  Applicant admits to using marijuana on several occasions while holding a\nsecurity clearance from 2000 to 2005. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.b because he was\nnot found guilty of the offense of the possession of marijuana/hashish offense and the passage of time\nsince his arrest. Drug involvement concerns remain due to his illegal drug use.\nThe drug involvement concern can be mitigated. However, I find none of the mitigating\nconditions apply.  In Applicant's case, two of the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC)\nhave the potential to apply.  DI MC \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  Applicant's drug\nuse was recent. His decision to use marijuana while holding a security clearance raises questions\nabout his judgment and reliability.\nDI MC \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation) is not applicable. Applicant's more recent use\nof marijuana occurred either by himself or with his wife. As such, disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts does not apply.  Applicant did disclose his drug use on his security clearance\nquestionnaire. He states that he has no intent to use marijuana because he wants to be a good example\nfor his son. An appropriate period of abstinence has not been demonstrated. He has not presented\nsufficient evidence to mitigate the drug involvement security concern.  I find against Applicant under\nGuideline H.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central\nquestion if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard\nclassified information.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a which cross alleges SOR \u00b6 1.c, regarding his use of marijuana after\nbeing granted a security clearance, a security concern is raised under personal conduct because\nApplicant's illegal use of marijuana after being granted a security clearance makes him vulnerable to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 17(e)\n(personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\n\n7\nthe person's personal professional, or community standing...) applies. While Applicant disclosed his\nuse of marijuana while holding a security clearance on his security clearance questionnaire, there is\ninsufficient evidence to fully support the mitigation of this concern. Personal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition (PC MC) \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) partially applies because of Applicant's\ndisclosure of his marijuana use from 2000 to 2005, on his security clearance application. However,\nnothing in the record evidence indicates that Applicant disclosed his marijuana use to his employer.\nHe is still vulnerable to exploitation or manipulation. He may not want to disclose his recent\nmarijuana use to his employer because it may place his job in jeopardy since illegal drug use is often\na concern in the work place.  Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to mitigate this concern.\nI find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.b which alleges that Applicant deliberately\nfalsified material facts in his response to interrogatories by failing to disclose that he started using\nmarijuana in 1985.  Applicant states that he thought he only had to list marijuana use within the past\nseven years. I find his explanation credible. I note that he listed a 1988 marijuana offense on his recent\nsecurity clearance questionnaire.  If he were trying to mislead the government about his earlier\nmarijuana use, it is likely that he would not have listed this offense. Aside from his own admissions\nin response to the SOR, there is no other evidence of Applicant's marijuana use in 1985 to 1995.  He\nhad no intent to mislead the government with respect to his earlier marijuana use.  SOR \u00b6 2.b is found\nfor Applicant.   \nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. While Applicant\nclaims that he no longer intends to use marijuana, his use of marijuana over a five year period after\nbeing granted a security clearance raises questions about his judgment and reliability.  He was in his\nmid to late thirties during his 2000 - 2005 marijuana use and cannot blame his marijuana use on\nyouthful indiscretion. Although he fully disclosed the recent marijuana use on his security clearance\napplication, a question remains as to his potential for vulnerability and duress absent evidence that\nhis employer is also aware of his marijuana use. Considering Applicant's history of marijuana use,\nnot enough time has passed to mitigate the security concerns raised under drug involvement.\nTherefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nGuideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2\nGuideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nErin C. Hogan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In this\nstatement, he admitted that he (1) used marijuana in 2007, (2) purchased and used\nEcstacy in January 2008, and (3) \u201cmay have acted as a middle man\u201d in the exchange of\nmoney and drugs. He also discussed his intentions regarding further drug use. He\nstated: \u201cMy intent on further use is not to use any illegal drugs a regular thing. I do not\nthink I would be apt to use ecstasy again and I believe it is kind of passed me. It was\nnice experience but I don\u2019t think it is necessary to use in the future. I do not plan on\nseeking out to use drugs but if marijuana was available in a social setting I might use it\nagain . . . .\u201d\nApplicant falsified material facts on a security clearance application (SCA)\nexecuted by him in July 2000 when he deliberately failed to disclose his 1999 marijuana\nuse.\n \nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\n\n3\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set forth in Paragraph 24 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug . . . can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nParagraph 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 25.a., \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying. Under\nParagraph \n25.c., \n\u201cillegal \ndrug \npossession, \nincluding \ncultivation, \nprocessing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution . . .\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph\n25.h., an \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s use of\nmarijuana, purchase and use of Ecstacy,  and his February 2008 statement in which he\nequivocated about his intentions for future drug use, raise these three disqualifying\nconditions.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I considered each of them and conclude none apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n4\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable because applicant intentionally provided false,\nmaterial information on the 2000 SCA.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 31.c., an \u201callegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s intentional misrepresentation\nof material facts on the 2000 SCA (a felony under 18 U.S.C. 1001) raises these two\ndisqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I have considered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \n\n5\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na history of illegal drug use and of being less than candid about it. His use of marijuana\nand ecstacy after he told the DoD in 2006 he did not intend to use it again, and his\nfailure to offer an unequivocal statement forswearing future illegal drug use when he\nhad the opportunity to do so in 2008, makes it impossible to conclude he is unlikely to\nuse illegal drugs in the future. For these reasons, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate\nthe security concerns arising from Guidelines H, E and J.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on October 8, 2007, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on January 9, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 15, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for February 6, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented\nfour exhibits.  The Applicant presented three exhibits and testified on his own behalf.\nThe official transcript (Tr.) was received on February 14, 2008.\n\n2\nMOTION TO AMEND SOR\nThe Government made a motion to amend the SOR under allegation 1b to reflect\na reference to question 27 instead of question 29 as alleged.  The Applicant had no\nobjection to said amendment.  The Government\u2019s motion was granted and said\namendment was made.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 28 years old and single.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Member of the Technical staff and is seeking to\nmaintain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant started using marijuana at the age of 19, in 2001, about the same\ntime he began working for a defense contractor.  He was hired as a summer intern while\npursuing his undergraduate degree.  He graduated from college in June 2002, and was\noffered a full time position by the defense contractor in October 2002.    \nThe Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) dated January\n8, 2002.  Question 27 of the application asked the Applicant if since the age of 16 or in\nthe last 7 years, whichever is shorter, has he illegally used any controlled substance for\nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack, cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine,\ncodeine, heroin, etc.), hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.) or prescription drugs.  The\nApplicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d.  The Applicant failed to list that he used marijuana from 1998\nto at least 2002.  (See Government Exhibit 2).  The Applicant subsequently received a\nSecret level security clearance.  \nThe Applicant explained that he knowingly submitted false information to the\nGovernment on his security clearance application because he was scared, it was his\nfirst job after college, and he wanted to stay in the city where he lives.  (Tr. pp. 45-46).\nThe Applicant justified his use of illegal drugs because he believed that it did not affect\nhis work performance.  Even though he knew that his marijuana use was illegal and that\nit was against company and DoD policy, he continued to use it.            \n\n3\nFrom 2002 through 2004, the Applicant continued to use marijuana while holding\na security clearance.  From August 2004 through May 2007, the Applicant earned a\nmasters degree in astronautical engineering with a 3.9 GPA, while working full time.\nSometime in 2004, the Applicant made a conscious decision to stop using marijuana\nand/or any other illegal drugs.  He became fully focused on his career goals and\ndedicated to a drug free lifestyle.  \nThe Applicant completed a second Security Clearance Application (SF-86) dated\nMay 12, 2005.  This time, he was applying for SCI access.  Question 27 of the\napplication asked the Applicant if since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is\nshorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana,\ncocaine, crack, cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.),\n(amphetamines, \ndepressants. \nBarbiturates, \nmethaqualone, \ntranquilizers, \netc.)\nhallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.) or prescription drugs.  The Applicant answered, \u2018YES\u201d,\nand listed that he had used marijuana a few times from January 2002 to January 2003.\nHe intentionally understated his use of marijuana.  He failed to list the fact that he had\nused marijuana with varying frequency from at least 1998 to at least September 2004.\n(See Government Exhibit 1).  The Applicant\u2019s SCI access was denied in August 2006.  \nThe Applicant stated that he wanted to come clean and reveal the truth about his\nmarijuana use when he filled out the second security clearance application.  This time\nhe made a mistake by revealing only the time of his peak use of marijuana 2002 to 2003\ninstead of revealing all of his use.  During a subsequent polygraph examination, the\nApplicant admitted that he had last used marijuana in September 2004.  The Applicant\nexplained that he did not take the security forms as serious as he should have.  He felt\nthat they did not define who he was and he now realizes his mistake.  He states that he\nhas grown up and understands the importance of being honest and truthful with the\nGovernment in answering the questions on his security forms.  He states that he now\nlives a good, honest life and usually keeps integrity at the front of his actions.  He is\nsaving money to buy a house, he plans to get engaged this summer, and is pursuing his\nhobby of building an experimental aircraft in his garage at home.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nAnswer to SOR).\n           Based upon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant deliberately falsified\nhis Security Clearance applications dated January 8, 2002 and May 12, 2005.      \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor, a Rabbi and friend,\nand a coworker, attest to the Applicant\u2019s fairness, intelligence, good judgment and\nintegrity.  He is considered a team player, and a valuable employee.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A).\nOther letters of commendation awarded to the Applicant reflect his personal\ncontributions and superb technical support and professionalism on the job.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B). \n\n4\nThe Applicant has received several awards and certificates of appreciation for his\nexceptional work performance.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n5\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in dishonesty that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n6\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in dishonesty (Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline E of the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct is very troubling.  He\nwas not honest with the Government on two separate security clearance applications\nconcerning his use of marijuana.  The first time he completed a security clearance\napplication in 2002, he denied all illegal drug use.  He was subsequently granted a\nsecurity clearance and continued to use marijuana.  The second time, in 2005, he\nadmitted drug use but significantly understated it.  This time he was not found to be\ntruthful and did not receive Special Compartmented Access (SCI).  On both occasions,\nhe deliberately tried to conceal the truth about his illegal drug use.  Consequently, his\ndishonesty with the Government concerning this matter is unacceptable.  \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying condition 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty\nof clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an\nApplicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his\npersonal background.  None of the mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under\nGuidelines E apply. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  The Applicant has been able to fulfill the academic requirements\nassociated with his career quite well.  However, he is young and immature and has\nmade a series of poor decisions that adversely effect his ability to obtain a security\nclearance.  He should never have used marijuana in the first place.  He should have\nrevealed the truth about his marijuana use on his security clearance applications, and\nhe should not have continued to use marijuana after having been granted a security\nclearance from the DoD.    \n\n7\n This Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: David P. Price, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nAfter reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s most recent background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national\n1\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. On August 28, 2007, DOHA issued\nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline E (personal\n2\nconduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).\nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on November 16, 2007, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on\nDecember 12, 2007. The parties appeared as scheduled. Without objection, I admitted\nfive exhibits offered by the government (Gx. 1 - 5). Applicant testified in his own behalf,\noffered 49 documents, which were sorted by topic into three exhibits and admitted\nwithout objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - C. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.)\non December 20, 2008. Based on the facts and conclusions set forth below, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for continued access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant was\narrested in January 2006 and charged with and pleaded guilty to driving under the\ninfluence (DUI), obstruction of justice, and cruelty to a child. The government further\nalleged that Applicant was given jail time for each offense, but the sentences were\nsuspended for three years. He admitted this allegation.\nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that when he was\narrested as described in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant\u2019s 15-year-old stepson had been driving\nthe car, but Applicant had switched seats with him to mislead the police officer into\nthinking Applicant had been driving the car when it was pulled over. Applicant admitted\nthis allegation. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make\nthe following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 36 years old and employed as a consulting analyst by a defense\ncontractor in support of a Navy program. He has worked for his current employer since\nFebruary 2006. From May 2000 until February 2006, he worked at the same facility but\nfor a different defense contractor. From 1990 until May 2000, he served in the United\nStates Navy as a fire controlman. But for a medical discharge due to asthma (Tr., 59),\nhe would have stayed in the Navy until he retired. Applicant\u2019s discharge was honorable,\nand he left the service as a first class petty officer (paygrade E-6). His performance\nevaluations were above average throughout his career, he has numerous personal\nawards and citations to his credit, and his conduct throughout his service was\nunblemished by misconduct of any kind. His evaluations from his civilian employers\nhave also been very good. References from co-workers and supervisors past and\npresent show Applicant to be an outstanding employee, and each recommend him for a\nposition of trust based on his honesty, integrity, and reliability. (Gx. 1; Ax. A; Ax. B)\nApplicant lives with his wife, who he married in October 2001, and her 17-year-\nold son from a previous marriage. Applicant and his stepson have a very good\nrelationship, but Applicant generally defers to the boy\u2019s mother in most decisions about\nhim. (Tr., 60 - 61) Since January 29, 2006, however, he and his wife have engaged in a\nmore collaborative process when it comes to family decisions. (Tr., 74) That evening, all\nthree drove in his wife\u2019s car to a friend\u2019s house for dinner. Applicant and his wife each\nconsumed alcohol with dinner, and they originally had intended to stay the night. Late in\nthe evening they decided to drive home, which was about 10 miles away, as Applicant\u2019s\nstepson had school the next day. After much badgering, Applicant\u2019s then-15-year-old\nstepson convinced his mother to let him drive them home, even though he did not yet\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and\n4\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\n3\nhave even a learner\u2019s permit. Applicant questioned the decision, but did not interfere.\n(Tr., 34, 49 - 51)\nOn the way home, they were pulled over by the police. After he stopped the car,\nApplicant\u2019s stepson jumped into the back seat with his mother, and Applicant jumped\ninto the driver\u2019s seat. The evidence is conflicting on whether the boy did so on his own\nor his mother told him to do it. What is clear is that it was not Applicant\u2019s idea for his\nstepson to drive the car in the first place, or for the boy to get in the back seat when\nthey were stopped. But Applicant decided without prompting to get behind the wheel for\nno other reason than to not have to explain why there was no driver when the police\nofficer came to the driver\u2019s side door. Subsequently, the police officer determined\nApplicant had been drinking and administered a field sobriety test, which showed\nApplicant\u2019s blood alcohol content to be .08%, which is the legal limit for driving after\ndrinking. Only after he was informed that he was being arrested and charged with\ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), did Applicant try to convince the arresting\nofficer that his stepson had been driving the car. Applicant was held in jail until late the\nnext day. (Gx. 2; Tr., 40, 66, 84; Ax. B)\nApplicant disclosed his arrest to his facility security officer the next day at work.\nWhen he reported to his new job with his current employer the following month, he\nagain disclosed his arrest. (Tr., 79 - 80)\nThe day after Applicant was released from jail, the arresting officer came to his\nhouse and arrested him again. The officer had reviewed the video tape of the traffic stop\nand confirmed that Applicant\u2019s stepson had been driving the car. (Tr., 44 - 46; Gx. 2)\nAdditional charges of obstruction of justice and cruelty to a child were entered against\nhim. In court on July 5, 2006, Applicant pleaded guilty to reckless driving, obstruction of\njustice, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was sentenced to a total of\none year and  90 days in jail, all of which was suspended for three years conditioned on\ngood behavior. He was also fined a total of $900, $300 of which was suspended, and he\nwas ordered to complete an alcohol safety awareness program (ASAP). Applicant\u2019s\ndriving privileges were also suspended for six months. Applicant has paid all fines and\ncosts, and he has  completed all other requirements of his sentence. He has also\ncompletely abstained from alcohol since his arrest. (Gx. 2 - 5; Ax. C; Tr., 79)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n4\n\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nmitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties at hearing require consideration of the security concerns and\nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline E (personal conduct), at AG \u00b6 15, and\nGuideline J (criminal conduct), at AG \u00b6 30.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct.\nUnder Guideline J, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) The government\u2019s\nexhibits, along with Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony, are sufficient to support the\nSOR allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant pleaded guilty to three charges in connection\nwith his arrests in January 2006. He received suspended jail terms, paid fines and\ncosts, completed ASAP, and lost his license for six months. These facts require\nconsideration of the disqualifying condition listed in AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime\nor multiple lesser offenses). \n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s jail sentences were suspended until July 2009 conditioned on his\ncontinued good behavior. There is no direct information showing Applicant was actually\nplaced in a probationary status, and a review of the records of the court\u2019s disposition of\nhis charges shows the boxes specifically reserved for an imposition of probation as part\nof his sentence were left blank. Nonetheless, the disqualifying condition listed in AG \u00b6\n31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation) applies because the effect of\nApplicant\u2019s suspended sentence is similar \u2013 if he is arrested and/or charged with\nanother criminal offense before July 2009, he may be incarcerated for all or part of the\ntime originally suspended.\nThe facts also support consideration of the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6\n32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) (emphasis added) and AG\n\u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement). The circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s arrest were unusual. It is also\nthe only incident of its kind in his background. Applicant has more input into decisions\nabout his stepson, and, aside from the incident in question, his judgment has been\nabove reproach. While Applicant is still subject to the terms of a possible jail sentence,\nthe totality of available information about Applicant\u2019s conduct, reliability, job\nperformance, and character is sufficient to conclude that he is not likely to engage in\ncriminal conduct in the future. Insofar as the adjudicative factors are not to be applied\ninflexibly or in a way that would produce an unfair result, that information is also\nsufficient to justify an exception to the AG \u00b6 31(d) disqualifying condition. On balance,\nthe security concerns about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct are mitigated.\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in AG \u00b6\n15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nAvailable information supports the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant switched seats\nwith his stepson when they were stopped by the police on their way home after a dinner\nparty. This conduct resulted in an obstruction of justice charge to which Applicant\npleaded guilty. Applicant was also charged with cruelty to a child, and Applicant pleaded\nguilty to the lesser included offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\nAside from being a clear instance of poor judgment and dishonesty, the conduct\nat issue is addressed by the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing\nfalse or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator,\nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment\nrepresentative) (emphasis added) is applicable here. Applicant\u2019s conduct in getting\nbehind the wheel when he did and his failure to tell the police his stepson had been\ndriving until after he knew he would be charged with DUI were intended to mislead  the\narresting officer. By contrast, the mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 3, supra.\n9\n6\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) (emphasis added) must\nalso be considered. This is the only instance of such poor decision making evident in\nthe available information. For the same reasons as discussed in support of AG \u00b6 32(a)\nand AG \u00b6 32(d), above, I conclude Applicant is not likely to repeat this conduct. The\nsecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct are mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors under Guidelines E and J. I have also reviewed the\nrecord in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG 2(a).  Applicant is a\n8\nmature adult who honorably served his country in the Navy until he was forced to leave\nthe military for medical reasons. He also has a solid record of performance and potential\nas a civilian employee in the defense industry. In his personal life, Applicant has\nbecome an excellent father figure and mentor for his wife\u2019s son. He has no known vices\nor financial problems and, apart from the adverse information presented here, he has\nbeen a responsible adult possessed of sound judgment and good character. In short,\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest Applicant will ever find himself in such trouble\nin the future. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all of the available information\n9\nshows his criminal and personal conduct do not present an unacceptable risk should he\nbe granted access to classified information.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                             \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

SAX\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant was born in Nigeria  in 1956.  He first came to the United States (U.S.) in about\n1976, attended and graduated from college, and became a U.S. citizen in 2004, at which time he also\nobtained a U.S. passport.  In 2006, he renewed his Nigerian passport.  After the hearing, he destroyed\nthe Nigerian passport, but did not renounce his Nigerian citizenship.  He has extensive family ties to\nNigeria.  He has not adequately demonstrated mitigation of the Governments evidence under either\nguideline.  Clearance is denied. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nOn July 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \nOn August 16, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected\nto have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing. The matter was assigned\nto me on September 20, 2007. On October 9, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the hearing\nfor November 5, 2007. At the hearing the Government introduced four (4) exhibits (Government\u2019s\nExhibit (GX) 1-4). The Government also offered five Official Notice Documents, which were marked\nand admitted as Official Notice (ON) Documents I-V. The applicant testified and introduced two\nexhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A-B). As post hearing exhibits, he offered four more documents\n(AX C-F). All exhibits were admitted into evidence. The transcript (Tr) was received on November\n15, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 51-year-old \"engineer/scientist\" for a defense contractor (GX 1). The SOR\ncontains five (5) allegations under Guideline C (Foreign Preference); and four (4) allegations under\nB (Foreign Influence). Applicant admits all allegations, with detailed comments. All specific\nadmissions are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following FINDINGS OF FACT as\nto the status, past and present, of each SOR allegation. \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \n1.a. Since Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen in 2004, he has exercised dual\ncitizenship with Nigeria and the United States (U.S.). He understands (correctly) that holding dual\ncitizenship is not illegal under U.S. law. He maintained and recently renewed his Nigerian passport\nbecause it made it easier to visit his family members in Nigeria. He never used it for any financial,\npolitical, or other personal purpose. Because it might affect his security clearance eligibility, he\nannounced his willingness to renounce his Nigerian citizenship and surrender his Nigerian passport\n(Response to SOR). As of November 12, 2007, Applicant destroyed the Nigerian passport and\nsurrendered it to his company\u2019s Facility Security Officer (AX C and AX D). However, as of the\nclosing of the record, Applicant has not demonstrated that he had renounced his Nigerian citizenship.\n1.b. Applicant has possessed a valid Nigerian passport that was renewed in 2006 and will\nexpire in May 2011. In his response to the SOR, he announced his willingness to surrender the\nNigerian passport. As noted above, on November 12, 2007, Applicant destroyed the Nigerian passport\nand surrendered it to his company\u2019s Facility Security Officer (AX C and AX D). \n1.c. - Applicant applied for and was issued a Nigerian passport on June 1, 2006, even though\n\n3\nhe became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. on February 25, 2004, and had a valid U.S. passport since\nFebruary 26, 2004.  He renewed the passport because it made it easier to visit his family members in\nNigeria. As noted above, on November 12, 2007, Applicant destroyed the Nigerian passport and\nsurrendered it to his company\u2019s Facility Security Officer (AX C and AX D). \n1.d. - Applicant used his Nigerian passport to travel to Nigeria, as cited in 1.b. and 1.c., above.\nAs cited in 1.a and 1.b., above, he has now destroyed his Nigerian passport and intends to use only\nhis U.S. passport from now on for all purposes (AX C). \n1.e. - Applicant owns a house in Nigeria.  His family made gift him of the land and he had the\nhouse built for his children and any other family members who wished to live there.  The fixed\nlocation of the house also helps his children who were away at college and need a permanent address.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n2.a. - Applicant\u2019s children (31, 29, and 25) are citizens and residents of Nigeria. All have a\ncollege education and have jobs not connected to the government. Some know basically what he does.\nApplicant has a close relationship with his children in Nigeria. \n2.b. - Applicant\u2019s brothers and sisters are residents and citizens of Nigeria. They lead their\nown lives with their families and he rarely sees them. None have any connection with the Nigerian\ngovernment. \n2.c. - As discussed above at 1.e., Applicant does own a house in Nigeria worth about $25,000.\nHis net worth in the U.S. is about $500,000\n2.d. - Applicant traveled to Nigeria in 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007. He travels there to see his\nfamily since it is difficult for them to come to the U.S. \nApplicant submitted several letters from friends and colleagues. One acknowledges\nApplicant\u2019s employment since 1997 as a Test and Evaluation Engineer (AX A). A second has known\nand been a friend of Applicant since 1991, while at college. \"To [his] knowledge, [Applicant] is\nhardworking, honest, and trustworthy [and] of excellent moral character\" (AX E). A third person has\nknown Applicant at work for about a year. He views Applicant as \"personable and honest,\" a \"hard\nworker who is interested in learning,\" and who is \"rational and works well within a team atmosphere\nand provides a good service to our department\" (AX F). Applicant\u2019s fiancee in the United States is\nexpecting their child (AX B). \nApplicant states that he stands by the oath of allegiance he took when he became a U.S. citizen\nin 2004 (AX C). Applicant \"came [to the U.S.] to seek a better life. [He] went to school, became an\nengineer, and . . . has been working [here] since [he] graduated\" (Tr at 25). He does not feel he can\nrenounce his family and intends to continue to visit them there, albeit with his U.S. passport (Tr at\n26). Neither he nor his family have any contacts with the Nigerian government. His life is in the\nUnited States and his fiancee is expecting a baby next Spring and the child will be an American\ncitizen (Tr at 26, 27). Applicant has no intention of moving back to Nigeria. Rather, his intention is\nto remain in the United States (Tr at 27). \nThe house in Nigeria was intended to be a gift for his family (Tr at 27). It would be \"easy\" for\nhim to give up the house in Nigeria if retaining it would cause a problem. (Id.). Since he took the Oath\n\n4\nof Allegiance, he has abided by te rules, paid his taxes, and been a good citizen (Tr at 28). \nPOLICIES \nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nin all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2). I have considered all nine\nfactors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion. \nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \"clearly consistent with the national interest\" for an Applicant to hold a security\nclearance. An Applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations. If allegations are denied or otherwise controverted\nby the Applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those controverted facts alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons. \nOnce the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the\nDirective, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant. \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence. As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, at\nE2.2.2., \"any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\"\nOfficial Notice Documents \nBased on the Official Notice documents submitted by the Government, I find the following\nto be official U.S. policy and findings as to Nigeria: \nNigeria was a former colonial possession of the United Kingdom until gaining independence\nin 1960. It is a Federal Republic in western Africa and is composed of 36 states and a capital territory.\nIt has a population of about 136 million people, the largest in Africa. The dominant ethnic group in\nthe upper 2/3 of the country is the Hausa-Fulani, the majority of whom are Muslim. Other major\nethnic groups in the north include the Nupa, Tiv, and Kanuri.  Applicant is from the Edo area of\nSouthern and Midwestern Nigeria, which is predominantly Christian.  \nOil is Nigeria\u2019s main source of income and the U.S. its major trading partner, mostly because\nof the oil. Nigeria\u2019s \"economic team\" enjoys an excellent reputation in the international community\n\n5\n(GX 9). Its military of 76,000 receives aid from the U.S.  Nigeria has a generally positive reputation\nin the international community and frequently sends peace keepers to other African nations, upon\nrequest. The U.S. is assisting Nigeria in the development of democratic processes (Id.). \nS i n c e\nbecoming independent, Nigeria has experienced periods of political and economic instability and\ncrisis. Political life has been intermittently troubled for long periods by conflict between and among\nits various ethnic and religious groups. The military has ruled Nigeria for more than half of its 47\nyears of period of independence. The government\u2019s human rights record is generally poor, and is\naimed primarily at internal minorities and political opponents. \nThe U.S. State Department has advised Americans of the risks of robberies and kidnaping\naimed at foreigners traveling in that country. Although some crime involves violence, the major\nillegal activity aimed at foreigners has traditionally been economic fraud scams. I note that none of\nthe Official Notice documents submitted by the Government mentions any espionage or information\ngathering involving sensitive information and material. Based on this record, I conclude that the\nnational security risk, with which the Government is concerned, is at the lower end of the threat\nspectrum. \nCONCLUSIONS \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the Unites States, then he or she may be prone to act in such a\nway \n1.a.-1.d. Applicant was born in Nigeria in 1956. His family is part of the \"EDO\" people on\nthe \"south side, the Christian side of Nigeria\" (Tr at15). He lived in Nigeria until age 20, when he\ncame to the U.S. in about 1976. He has been here about 21 years and has worked for his present\nemployer since about 1995 (Tr at 28), without any problems of record. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in February 24, 2004 (GX 1). He considers himself to be a\ngood citizen (Tr at 28). He renewed his Nigerian passport in 2006 (valid until 2011), in order to\nfacilitate his travel to Nigeria to see his family. His last trip to Nigeria was in January 2007 (Tr at 33).\nOnce he understood the Government\u2019s concerns about his retention of the Nigerian passport, he\ndestroyed it in the presence of his employer\u2019s Facility Security Officer. \nApplicant\u2019s intentions as to his Nigerian citizenship was the subject of some discussion at the\nhearing. As I understand his position on this point, it is that because he is \"entitled to have dual\ncitizenship [under U.S. Supreme Court precedent],\" he did not intend to renounce that citizenship\neven though he had destroyed his Nigerian passport (Tr at 34-36).  He will renounce his Nigerian\ncitizenship only if he has \"a reason\" to do so (Tr at 36), but apparently does not believe he has such\na reason.  At the same time, he is not a fan of Nigeria. In fact he is \"bitter about what is going on over\nthere by the government\" (Tr at 27). \nThere is no child support requirement in Nigeria, but Applicant has provided them with\nmoney, helped them to attend college, and gave one daughter $10,000 when she was married (Tr at\n42, 43). Applicant speaks with his children one or twice a month (Tr at 44-46). He considers himself\nto be \"very close\" with them. The house he had built for them in Nigeria cost about $35,000 (Tr at\n54). His net worth in the United States is about $500,000 (Tr at 54, 55).When he sends them money,\nhe does so by transferring money from his bank in the United States to a Western Union office in\nNigeria where one of his children picks it up (Tr at 48). \n\n6\nWith the closing of the record upon receipt of his post hearing submission (AX B), Applicant\ndestroyed his Nigerian passport, but did not renounce his Nigerian citizenship. As was discussed\nduring the hearing, retaining his Nigerian citizenship was a negative factor that would be considered\nalong with all other relevant evidence of record.(Tr at 63-65) Afer a careful consideration of all the\nevidence, I am unable to conclude that Applicant has mitigated any questions about has eligibility.\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States. \nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 10.(a) (1) applies in that Applicant obtained, possessed and\nused a foreign passport. It has recently been appropriately destroyed; DC 10.(b) is applicable in that\nApplicant did seek and acquire a Nigerian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. In addition,\nApplicant still retains his Nigerian citizenship, which means he can obtain a replacement Nigerian\npassport. \nOf the possible Mitigating Conditions (MC) 11(a) applies in that he acquired Nigerian\ncitizenship because of his being born in Nigeria to Nigerian parents. However, he has since\naffirmatively exercised that citizenship by asking for and obtaining a new Nigerian passport after\nbecoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. 11.(b) does not apply since Applicant has apparently withdrawn\nhis willingness to renounce his Nigerian citizenship. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not clearly demonstrated an unequivocal preference for the United\nStates. Under the circumstances of this case, I find against Applicant under Guideline C. \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties\nor foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline should consider the identity of\nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or interest is located, including but not limited to,\nsuch considerations as whether the country is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism \n2.a and 2b. - Applicant has four grown children and four siblings who are citizens and\nresidents of Nigeria. Under Appeal Board precedent, all eight are considered to be \"immediate\"family\nmembers and Applicant\u2019s description of his relationship with them confirms that the relationships\nmust be considered close. I have considered his ties to the United States. He has been here for 21\nyears, but became a citizen only in 2004. His pending child will be his first family in this country. He\ntravels often to Nigeria to visit his family, and has built a house for them to live in. Nigeria is not\nlisted in official U.S. documents as active in espionage activities against the United States, but it does\nhave a record of terrorist activities, some of which are aimed at U.S. citizens and other foreigners. \nDisqualifying Condition - Based on the totality of the evidence, I conclude that DC) 7(a) is\napplicable because of Applicant\u2019s \"contact with . . . foreign family members who are citizens or\nresidents of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Mitigating Conditions - None that are established\nby the record evidence, specifically 8.(a): the presence of so many family members in a country\n\n7\nknown for terrorist activities and economic crime. \nThe record raises additional concerns in that Applicant chose to become a U.S. citizen only\nin 2004, despite being a resident of this country since 1976. \nIn summary, and despite the favorable comments from others that he submitted, Applicant has\n(1) not yet demonstrated an unequivocal preference for the United States, (2) retains his Nigerian\ncitizenship, and (3) has such strong ties to immediate family members in Nigeria as to raise a risk that\nhe might feel forced to choose between his loyalty to his family in Nigeria and his loyalty to the\nUnited States. \nConsidering all the evidence, I conclude that Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof either Guideline B and C, or the principles behind the \"whole person\" concept.  Consequently, he\nhas not yet demonstrated that he possesses the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of\nanyone seeking a security clearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a. \nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b. - \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c. \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d. - \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e. \nAgainst the Applicant.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b. - \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c. \nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.d.  \nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION \nIn light of all the circumstance presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \nv c\nBARRY M.
