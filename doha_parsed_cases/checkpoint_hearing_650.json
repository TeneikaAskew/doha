From 1996 to 2015 she worked full time for a different federal contractor. She is married for the second time and has two step-children.1 The SOR alleged 20 delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,000.

The debts are supported by credit reports from September 2016 and May 2018, her statement to an investigator in January 2018, and her SOR admissions in her answer from August 2018.2 Applicant attributes her financial problems to her underemployment resulting from the loss of a major defense contract by her employer in 2015. Her income was reduced from approximately $98,000 in 2015 to $24,567 in 2016, and to $3,797 in 2017.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \neffective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 2, 2018, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 17, 2018. The evidence \n02/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 2-6 (Item 1 includes pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on October \n1, 2018. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She submitted a one-page document in reply to \nthe FORM, which I marked as exhibit (AE) A. She did not file objections to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. Items 2-6 and AE A are admitted into evidence without \nobjections. The case was assigned to me on February 8, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \u2013 1.p, which she \ndenied. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old. She has worked for a government contractor since \nFebruary 2016. From 1996 to 2015 she worked full time for a different federal \ncontractor. She is married for the second time and has two step-children.1  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged 20 delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,000. The debts \nare comprised of charged-off and collections accounts (automobile repossession \ndeficiency, credit cards, consumer debts, telecommunication debts, and a medical \ndebt). The debts are supported by credit reports from September 2016 and May 2018, \nher statement to an investigator in January 2018, and her SOR admissions in her \nanswer from August 2018.2 \n \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to her underemployment resulting \nfrom the loss of a major defense contract by her employer in 2015. Her income was \nreduced from approximately $98,000 in 2015 to $24,567 in 2016, and to $3,797 in 2017. \nApplicant contacted an attorney to file a bankruptcy case, but as of September 2018, no \ncase had been filed. Aside from using the bankruptcy process to have her debts \ndischarged, Applicant has taken no other action to pay or otherwise resolve the SOR \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s debts remain unresolved.3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n                                                          \n1 Items 2-3. \n \n2 Items 1, 3-5. \n \n3 Items 1, 6; AE A. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid or unresolved. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. She did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that her financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. Applicant presented some evidence that the debts were due to \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncircumstances beyond her control (underemployment due to loss of government \ncontract). She did not show that she took responsible action to attempt to resolve her \ndebts. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. Applicant\u2019s only efforts to resolve her debts \nwas to inquire into the bankruptcy process by hiring an attorney. She documented no \nfurther action by her since then. She failed to provide documentation showing any \nefforts to contact the creditors, set up payment plans, or make payments on the listed \ndebts. There is no evidence she obtained financial counseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) \ndo not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s period of \nunderemployment. However, she also failed to present documentation addressing her \ndebt. Applicant has not established a track record of financial stability.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.t: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all adjudicative \ndecisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided a response to the SOR on July 13, 2018, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. In her response, she admitted \nall five allegations of the SOR and provided four documents.  \n02/01/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 15, \n2018, which included five documents. A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections \nand submit a written response and documents to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on October 2, 2018. She had until \nNovember 16, 2018, to respond to the FORM and provide documentation in mitigation of \nthe Government\u2019s security concerns. She failed to provide a response. The four exhibits \nApplicant attached to her SOR answer and the Government\u2019s five exhibits are admitted \ninto the record. The Government\u2019s exhibits are referred to herein using Department \nCounsel\u2019s numbering for each Item. The case was assigned to me on January 30, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant admitted the five allegations under Guideline F and \nset forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. She earned a high school diploma in 2003 and an \nAssociate\u2019s degree in 2004. She entered into a civil union in 2004 and has two children, \nages 11 and 13. She has worked for a government contractor as a reviewer since 2017. \n(Item 3 at 2.) She has been continuously employed in a full-time job since 2008. \n \n \nOn October 24, 2017, she submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In the \nSCA, she disclosed that she was delinquent on several debts, including the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. With respect to her college student loans (SOR \u00b6 1.a), \n(apparently borrowed in 2003 and 2004), she has never been able to afford payments on \nthe loans, which now total about $26,000. According to her statement in her SCA, these \nloans were in forbearance until March 2012, and she has been unable to pay them \u201cdue \nto poor job decisions and having children.\u201d The loans have been assigned to the \nGovernment and are presently in collection. In her January 2018 background interview, \nshe stated that she intended to contact the Government and begin paying this debt after \nshe received her 2017 tax refund. (Item 3 at 3.) She provided an introductory rehabilitation \nletter from the U.S. Department of Education, dated February 26, 2018, with her July 2018 \nSOR answer. She failed to provide anything further and did not respond to the FORM in \nwhich Department Counsel made clear that she needed to provide documentation of \npayments on her debts to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns. (Item 3 at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted in her SOR answer that her two Capital One credit card \naccounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c) have been charged off. The Government\u2019s evidence \nshows that the last payments on these accounts were made in May 2017. Applicant wrote \nin her October 2017 SCA that these accounts were four months delinquent because her \nhusband changed jobs and implied that he made less income. She wrote further that she \nplanned to begin paying these accounts again in November 2017. In her January 2018 \nbackground interview, she explained that her husband had changed jobs to a \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application, dated October 24, \n2017 (FORM Item 2), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \ncommission-based compensation and that this caused them financial hardship. (Item 3 \nat 4.) She further advised the investigator that he changed jobs again to a full-time job, \nwhich would give them sufficient income to start paying these debts. She attached to her \nSOR answer two documents reflecting her agreement with the collection agency handling \nthese accounts, Client Services Incorporated, to pay both accounts off within a year or \nso. (Item 1.) She has offered no additional evidence, however, to reflect that she followed \nthrough on these two payment plans or has made any payment to the creditor. \n \n \nThe two other delinquent debts in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) are credit card debts. \nApplicant provided a proposed payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but has \nprovided no evidence of any follow-up actions or payments. Also, she provided no \nevidence reflecting any efforts to contact the creditor handling the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her testimony and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \n\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant blames her financial problems on her poor job choices, which \npresumably refers to working at jobs with low wages. She also blames her problems on \nthe expense of raising two children and her husband\u2019s decision to work at a job with an \nunreliable commission income. Starting in 2018, he has been working at a full-time job \nand apparently with a more reliable income. She advised the investigator conducting her \nbackground interview that she anticipated receiving a tax refund in March 2018 and would \nbegin repaying her debts. She provided no evidence that she made any payments on any \nof her debts, even though Department Counsel in his FORM explicitly wrote that she has \nnot provided evidence of any payments of her debts and such evidence was important to \nher case. She also provided no evidence that she has received any financial counseling. \n \n \nI conclude that none of the above mitigating conditions apply and that Applicant \nhas not made a serious attempt to provide evidence to support a conclusion that she has \nacted responsibly in the handling of her delinquent debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n\n \n6 \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher past actions. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e: Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n",

Eisen, Esq. \n05/07/2019\n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nCurry, Marc, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns generated by his \nfamily members who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective June 8, 2017. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOD adjudicators \ncould not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue his security clearance. It recommended that his \ncase be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether his clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nOn August 28, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting all of the \nallegations, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on December 1, \n2018. On January 17, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, scheduling the case for \nMarch 4, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, Department \nCounsel submitted three documents for admission that I marked as Government \nExhibits (GEs) 1 through 3. Applicant submitted 13 exhibits, incorporated into the record \nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1 through 13. \n \nI took administrative notice, at Department Counsel\u2019s request, of the facts \nencapsulated within seven source documents, identified as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I \nthrough HE VII. Also, I received a copy of the discovery letter mailed from Department \nCounsel to Applicant, incorporating it into the record as HE VIII. The transcript was \nreceived on February 26, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old single man. He was born, raised, and educated \nthrough high school, in Iraq, immigrating to the United States in 2010, and becoming a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2015. (Tr. 31) He earned an associate\u2019s degree in database \nmanagement in 2017. (Tr. 42) \n \n \nBetween 2003 and 2010, while living in Iraq, Applicant worked for a defense \nsubcontractor that provided supplies to the U.S. forces. (Tr. 30)  According to his team \nleader, he was \u201can ideal employee as well as an intelligent and hard-working individual.\u201d \n(AE E)  \n \nIn 2010, Applicant applied for, and was granted, a special immigration visa to \nimmigrate to the United States after someone in his community in Iraq discovered that \nhe was supporting the United States mission, leading to death threats. (Tr. 31) After \nimmigrating to the United States, Applicant worked a variety of jobs before returning to \nthe defense field and taking a job supporting U.S. military advisors as an Arabic role \nplayer in 2017. (AE F) According to his supervisor, his training was instrumental to the \nprogram, as his \u201cability to think quickly and . . . grasp . . . the cultural nuances frequently \nencountered . . . made him an invaluable asset to the team.\u201d (AE F) Per a coworker, \nApplicant is dependable, duty-driven, and honest.\u201d (AE D) He was the most popular \ntrainer on base, as his \u201cinnate knowledge and native language skills facilitated the \ntraining scenarios and significantly enhanced the realism of the pre-deployment training  \n. . . conducted for thousands of . . . security forces annually.\u201d (AE D) According to the \nsenior program manager, Applicant \u201cdemonstrated a dedication to duty and an ability to \nbe trusted in all circumstances.\u201d (AE C) \n \nIn July 2018, Applicant began working for his current employer. He is a linguist, \nworking on location abroad. (Tr. 52) According to the site lead, \u201che is the type of \nemployee that every manager wants to have,\u201d and his \u201cprofessionalism has directly \ncontributed to the success of the synergy between the Coalition forces and their Iraqi \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \ncounterparts.\u201d (AE H) In February 2019, Applicant received a certificate of recognition \nfor his outstanding service as a linguist in the field. (AE K) \n \n \nApplicant is equally well-respected in his community. A friend characterizes him \nas \u201ca selfless person who believes in helping others in need [regardless] of race, origin, \nor religion. (AE J) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iraq. (Answer at 1) They are \ntailors. (GE 1 at 27) Applicant communicates with his mother by phone approximately \nonce every month, and they communicate on a family online chatroom app approximate \nthree days per week. (Tr. 41, 68) Applicant\u2019s father is \u201cold school,\u201d and prefers not to \nuse a cell phone often. (Tr. 67) Moreover, they \u201cdo not get along very well.\u201d They talk on \noccasion when Applicant calls his mother, and she gives his father the phone to say \nhello. (Tr. 68) In 2016, Applicant gifted them $6,000. (Tr. 89) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. He works in an Iraqi law \nenforcement unit analogous to a SWAT team, handling hostage rescue and interdiction, \ntogether with other counter-terrorism activities. (Tr. 34) He was hired and trained for this \nposition by the U.S. provisional government in 2007. (Tr. 33) For his first three years on \nthe job, he was under U.S. government supervision. (Tr. 34) Recently, he transferred \npositions within the police force, and now provides marksmanship training to Iraqi army \nmembers. (Tr. 34) Applicant has not spoken to his brother since the summer of 2018. \n(Tr. 77) They had \u201ca falling out,\u201d over a family-related matter. (Tr. 77) Previously, they \nspoke approximately twice per week. (GE 3 at 1) \n \n \nApplicant has two younger sisters. The youngest sister helps her husband, \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law, operate a carpenter shop. (Tr. 36) Applicant\u2019s next-youngest \nsister operates a business with her husband, Applicant\u2019s other brother-in-law, involving \nonline product marketing. (Tr. 80; GE 2 at 5) Before starting this business, Applicant\u2019s \nbrother-in-law was a police officer. (Tr. 80) He and Applicant\u2019s sister started the \nbusiness as a part-time endeavor. After it began thriving in 2017, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-\nlaw quit his job with the police department to focus exclusively on the online marketing \nbusiness. (Tr. 80) \n \n \nApplicant and his youngest sister communicate by text daily, and he \ncommunicates by text with his other sister two to three times per week. (GE 2 at 5) \nPeriodically, his sisters post pictures of their children, or their favorite recipes on the \nfamily chat room. (Tr. 41) Applicant last traveled to Iraq to visit his family members in \n2014. (Tr. 61) He has not seen them since he has been working there. \n \n \nApplicant owns no property in Iraq. (Tr. 54) He has $30,000 deposited in a U.S. \nchecking account, and $15,000 invested in a 401k retirement account. (Tr. 55, 57) He \nplans to buy a home, and rent it so long as he is working overseas, then move into it \nonce he returns. (Tr. 47-48)  \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \nAdministrative Notice \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. (HE I at 1) Although the Iraqi \ngovernment has made impressive gains over the years towards curbing terrorism, \nsignificant problems remain, as the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) continues to \nexert influence in parts of the country. (HE VII at 3) The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. \ncitizens are at high risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel \nto Iraq. (Item II at 1) The U.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. \ngovernment personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work \nunder strict security guidelines. (HE III at 2)  \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n \nApplicant has not visited his family members in Iraq in five years. Conversely, he \ncommunicates with them frequently through text messaging and social media, and has \nprovided significant financial support to his parents over the years. Moreover, although \nApplicant is currently not talking to his brother, they have not been out of touch long \nenough to be considered estranged. I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of supporting U.S. interests under dangerous conditions, \nbeginning in 2003, when he took a job with a contractor to help provide supplies to the \nU.S. \u2013 led coalition forces in Iraq. He immigrated to the United States after his security \nwas compromised, in 2010. Since living in the United States, he continued to \ndemonstrate his commitment to U.S. objectives, working as a role player in military \ntraining exercises. Despite leaving Iraq in fear for his life in 2010, he returned in 2018 to \nhelp coalition forces on the ground, working as a translator, where he has performed \nexcellently. Under these circumstances, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of \ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign \nperson, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so nominal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence \nsecurity concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nIn reaching this decision, I was particularly cognizant of Applicant\u2019s stellar \nemployment and character references. \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

All exhibits were admitted without objection. The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on January 2, 2019.  On February 6, 2019, I proposed to the parties \nthat this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nDepartment Counsel did not object. \n1 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), which became effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n02/07/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since October 2017. He has never had a clearance before. He earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He has never married and has no children. (GE 1; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana frequently, and also purchased it, after high school and \nin college (2007-2014). He tried hallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD twice each, also in \ncollege. After college, he used marijuana about 20 or 30 times between 2014 and May \n2017. (Tr. 39-42, 48-51) His marijuana use was mostly social, though he also used it to \nalleviate pain from a serious medical condition for a brief period in 2011, before the \ncondition required surgery. Applicant\u2019s medical condition is chronic, but he now takes \nprescription medication for it. (Tr. 54-59)  \n \n \nApplicant fully disclosed his illegal drug use on his August 2017 security \nclearance application. (GE 1) At hearing, he attributed his social drug use to his attitude \ntowards college.2 He testified that being laid off from a job in May 2017 led to a \nmaturation process and a desire to \u201cturn the corner\u201d and \u201cmake the right decisions.\u201d (Tr. \n43) He moved to a new state when he was hired by his current employer. He no longer \nassociates with his college friends. Applicant credibly testified that he no longer has any \ndesire nor any future intent to use marijuana or any illegal drug in the future. (Tr. 44-46) \nHe provided a signed statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, and he \nacknowledged that any future illegal drug use would be grounds to revoke his security \nclearance. (AE L) \n \n \nApplicant presented two strong character witnesses. His direct supervisor, a \nNaval Academy graduate who hired him and who works with him daily, testified to \nApplicant\u2019s exemplary work performance, his judgment, trustworthiness, reliability and \noverall suitability for a clearance. A close personal friend said Applicant is honest, \ntrustworthy and extremely respectful towards others. (Tr. 19-37) Several other character \nreferences, including family members, lifelong friends, and a former supervisor, all \nprovided strong letters of recommendation in which they attested to Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, trustworthiness, moral character, and suitability for a clearance. (AE A \u2013 K) \n \n \n \nThe disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are raised by the \nevidence. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is relatively recent. However, he disclosed his \nillegal drug use fully on his SCA, and credibly testified that he has had a significant \nlifestyle change since his last drug use (including losing his job and moving away from \nhis college environment and to a new state). He has no desire or future intention to use \nillegal drugs, and understands that to do so is unacceptable for someone entrusted with \naccess to classified information. I find that he has abstained from illegal drug use for an \nappropriate period, and that he is unlikely to use illegal drugs in the future. The \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \n \nThe security concerns over Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use no longer create doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \n                                                          \n2 Tr. 44 (\u201cI went to college where people vacation, and I treated it like a vacation at the time.\u201d). \n\n \n3 \n \nand considered that the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also \ngave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that \nApplicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. This case \nis decided for Applicant.  \n \n \n________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 18, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on April 30, 2019.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on May 2, 2019, and \nthe hearing was convened as scheduled on June 4, 2019. The Government offered nine \nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were admitted without \nobjection. The Applicant offered ten exhibits referred to as Applicant Exhibits A through \n\n \nJ, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant called two witnesses and testified \non his own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on June 25, 2019 \nto allow Applicant to submit additional supporting documentation.  Applicant submitted \none Post-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit K, which was \nadmitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June \n17, 2019. \n \n \n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old, and is married with three adult children.  He has a high \nschool diploma and 2 \u00bd years of college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a \nSoftware Engineer.  He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.   \n \nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption \nGuideline J- Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in excessive alcohol \nconsumption, which often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant began working for his current employer in 2015, but has been working \non the same military base for the past thirty-four years.  He states that he has held a \nsecurity clearance for thirty-four years.  \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of alcohol abuse.  On three separate occasions over \nthe past thirty years, he has been arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol \n(DUI).  Applicant does not believe he is an alcoholic, but does believe that he may have \nhad a drinking problem when he was a young man in the 1980\u2019s.  He explained that his \nexcessive drinking has occurred only at social gatherings.    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent arrest for DUI, and DUI with a blood alcohol content of \n.08% or higher was in July 2016.  (Government Exhibit 9.)  His blood alcohol content at \nthe time of arrest was about .15%.  Applicant explained that he drove his assistant \ncollege baseball coach home after one of the games.  When they arrived they \ndiscussed and reviewed game plays and write-ups that were presented to various \nbaseball scouts.  Applicant states that he had one Jack Daniels and coke drink.  His \nfriend then asked for a ride to his wife\u2019s friend\u2019s house where his wife was located, and \nwhen Applicant arrived he consumed another drink of alcohol.  He then proceeded to \ndrive himself home, and on the way was arrested.   Applicant was given a field sobriety \ntest that he failed, and was taken to county jail where he spent the night.  Applicant pled \nno contest to the second count, and the first count was dismissed.  He was ordered to \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nenroll in an alcohol program, complete 45 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, and \nabstain from alcohol for 15 months.  He was placed on three year probations that was to \nend in August 2019.  Prior to this arrest, Applicant was arrested on two other occasions \nfor DUI. \n \n \nIn January 2001, Applicant was arrested for DUI, and DUI with a BAC of .08% or \nhigher.  (Government Exhibit 8.)  Applicant stated that on this occasion, he and his wife \nwere invited to attend a Super Bowl Party.  His wife fell ill and did not attend.  Applicant \nattended the party without her, and left the party unexpectedly around halftime when an \nindividual he did not like showed up that Applicant did not want to be around.  On the \nway home there was a checkpoint, and Applicant was pulled over, and arrested for DUI.  \nApplicant\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of arrest was .20%.  Applicant pled no contest \nto the DUI and was placed on three year probation, in addition to being fined $1,429, \nordered to pay victim restitution of $100, enroll in and complete a six-month alcohol- \nawareness program, and ordered to abstain from drinking alcohol for two years with his \ndriving privilege suspended for ninety days, serve ten days in jail with credit for one day \non March 16, 2001.  Applicant\u2019s probation did not terminate until about March 2004.   \n \n \nIn May 1987, Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  \n(Government Exhibit 7.)  He pled no contest and was placed on three year probation, \nfined, and ordered to attend an alcohol awareness program.  Applicant does not \nremember the details of this arrest.  (Tr. p. 61.) \n \n \nApplicant is currently on probation for his 2016 DUI conviction that will terminate \nin August 2019.  He states that he no longer consumes alcohol.  He states that his last \ndrink of alcohol was in the summer of 2016.  He no longer has cravings for alcohol.  He \nstates that he has made the decision to completely live a sober lifestyle.  He states that \nhe has no intentions of ever using alcohol, not simply because it was a term of \nprobation but because he genuinely wishes to take positive steps to improve himself as \na person.  He wants to look for some kind of psychological counseling that he thinks \nwould be helpful to him.  (Tr. pp. 58 -59.)  He has continued to comply with all terms of \nhis probation and has enrolled in the prescribed alcohol awareness program that he has \nattended for about a year.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D, G, and Tr. p. 64.)  \n \n \nApplicant states that he is now more involved with the community, still coaching \nbaseball, and has found religion.  He attends church regularly, and the power of prayer \nhas helped him with his drinking.  (Tr. p. 75.)  He had previously stepped away from his \nreligion and is now back on course.  His brother helped get him back into it, and it has \nhelped create a new outlook on life for Applicant.  (Tr. p. 71.) \n \n \nIn December 2003, Applicant was issued his first SOR from the DoD.  The matter \nwas adjudicated, and Applicant\u2019s security clearance was subsequently revoked.  \nApplicant was aware at that time that the DoD was concerned about his excessive \ndrinking, and at that time Applicant had only been arrested on two occasions for DUI.  \n(ISCR Case No. 03-11548.)   \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor, as well as the Director, testified on behalf of \nthe Applicant.  Both gentlemen considered the Applicant to be an excellent employee \nand recommend his retention of his security clearance.  (Tr. pp. 29-46.)     \n \n \nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant for 2006 through 2007; 2008 through \n2009; and 2016 are all favorable and reflect that he consistently exceeds expectations \nin most cases.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B and C.)  \n \n \nEleven letters of recommendation from colleagues and friends of the Applicant \nattest to his integrity, honesty, credibility and good judgment.  From those who have \nworked with him, Applicant is described as conscientious and security conscious.  He is \na hard worker who always maintains a can-do attitude, and is admired by many of his \ncoworkers and considered to be a valuable asset to the mission.  He is recommended \nfor a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I.) \n \n \nA chemical dependency assessment of the Applicant from a licensed \npsychotherapist dated June 18, 2019, indicates a positive prognosis.  The \npsychotherapist refers to a history of four DUI\u2019s, not three.  It is not clear whether this \nwas an error or is factual.  The letter indicates that Applicant has a history of binge \ndrinking with no cravings for alcohol in between episodes resulting in four DUI\u2019s.  The \npsychotherapist further noted that, \u201cquite commonly, this drinking pattern limits an \nindividual\u2019s ability to identify the power alcohol exhibits over them.  Despite this, Mr. \nMuro took his 2016 DUI seriously and stopped drinking immediately afterwards.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s current sobriety plan and dedication to maintaining sobriety overall is very \npositive.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit K.) \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable \nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an \napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(b) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n  \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant incurred three arrests and charges for DUI.  \nThese incidents raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c).   \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern  of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear  and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \n \nApplicant failed to introduce sufficient evidence of rehabilitation. Although it has \nnot been determined if he is an alcoholic or is alcohol dependent, he has had three \nalcohol-related incidents away from work, the most recent one occurred as recently as \n2016.  Even after receiving an SOR from DOHA in 2003, which ultimately resulted in the \nrevocation of his security clearance, Applicant has continued to consume alcohol to \nexcess at times and he continued to drink and drive.  His conduct has been \nirresponsible and dangerous.  Following each DUI arrest, he has tried to stop drinking.  \nOn each occasion, after a short period, he resumed his previous pattern of drinking.  \nGiven the extensive nature of his drinking and the fact that his time in sobriety is still \nfresh, Applicant has not demonstrated sufficient good judgment and reliability necessary \nto access classified information.   \u00b6 23 does not provide mitigation. \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and  \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nAppellant was arrested for drinking and driving on three occasions and was \nconvicted each time.  The aforementioned disqualifying conditions have been \nestablished.  \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nAs the years have passed, Appellant violated the law by continuing to drink and \ndrive.  His three arrests and convictions for DUI speak for themselves.  Although \nApplicant now states that he will no longer consume alcohol, and has been sober for \nthree years, given his arrest history, and the fact that the most DUI occurred as recently \nas 2016, there is no guarantee that Applicant will not soon return to his old ways.  None \nof the mitigating conditions establish full mitigation.     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G and Guideline J in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant continued to \nconsume alcohol to excess even after being arrested on two separate occasions for DUI \nwhen his blood alcohol level was extremely high.  As a result, he was arrested a third \ntime which brings us to this hearing.  At this time, the evidence in mixed, and there is no \nstrong evidence in the record to show that he will remain sober for any sustained period.  \nHe has failed to present sufficient evidence of rehabilitation to overcome his heavy \nburden to mitigate his alcohol abuse.  Overall, the record evidence raises doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative \nguidelines. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:    \n           Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:                        Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He did not meet his burden to mitigate \nthe financial considerations guideline. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 24, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Adjudicative Guidelines \nF (financial considerations), H (drug involvement and substance misuse), J (criminal \nconduct), and E (personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 7, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings \n\n \n2 \n \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 1, 2019, scheduling the hearing \nfor June 13, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \nI marked the Government\u2019s discovery letter and its exhibit list as Hearing Exhibits \n(HE) I. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel amended SOR \u00b6 1 to \ninclude a new allegation 1.i, pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive.  \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s request and with no objection from Department Counsel, I left the \nrecord open until July 8, 2019. Applicant timely provided one document, which I marked \nas (AE) B, and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant requested a few \nmore days and I extended the record until July 12, 2019. He submitted one more \ndocument, which was marked as AE C and admitted in evidence without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 25, 2019.  \n                                                                                                                                                        \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations.  He is 33 years \nold. He is divorced and has four children. Applicant completed his security clearance \napplication in June 2016. He has not previously held a security clearance. (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2004 and attended a technical school, \nearning a degree in aviation in 2011. He has worked for his current employer as an \nelectronic technician for eight years. He was unemployed for a period of six months in \n2009. (GE 1) \n \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.i allege two child support collection accounts; four collection \naccounts; one charged-off medical account, and an amended state tax debt for about \n$1,600. Applicant claimed that he has been paying his child support (deduction from his \npay check) and several other accounts. He stated that all his financial documents were \nlost in a car accident in the spring. (Tr. 12) \n \n \nApplicant attributes the debts to his overextending himself while trying to take \ncare of his family. He explained that he decided to put off some creditors to pay others. \nHe realizes that a better approach would have been to contact the creditors and work \nout an agreement. (GE) 2 He stated that he has reduced his spending habits and \nconcentrates on his expenses. Applicant now earns about $65,000 a year, which \ndepends on overtime. He is paid hourly. (Tr. 38) He has no savings and little in his \nchecking account. He lives with his mother, and pays $100 a month in rent. (Tr. 39) He \nuses his girlfriend\u2019s car and pays the car insurance. (Tr. 71) He has not obtained credit \ncounseling. (Tr.57) He does not follow a budget.  \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.a ($13,000) and 1.b ($2,677), Applicant admitted that he was \ndelinquent in child support, but explained that $432 is automatically deducted from his \n\n \n3 \n \npay each month. At the hearing, Applicant stated that he did not pay attention and \nmoney was not deducted for child support in 2004 to 2008. (Tr. 29-33) He does not \nknow what the correct balances on his child support cases are at this time. (Tr. 36) \n \n \nSOR 1.c is a wireless collection account in the amount of $2,213. Applicant \nstated that he is now making payments in the amount of $50 a month. (GE 2) He \nsubmitted one document that showed $50 was debited from his bank account on June \n18, 2019. He stated at the hearing that he has a $400 balance, and he claims that he \nstarted paying in 2016. (Tr. 21, 43) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.d, a collection account in the amount of $1,742, for a security \nsystem, Applicant intends to pay the amount due on the account, but he has not had the \nmoney to do so yet. (Tr. 22) \n \n \nSOR 1.e is a medical account in collection for $828. He has not made any \npayments on the account. He believes that the bill was for hospital visits. \n \n \nSOR 1.f is a charged-off account in the amount of $455. He stated at the hearing \nthat he is paying $50 a month. (Tr. 23) He submitted no documentation. During his 2017 \nOPM interview, he stated that he would contact the creditor and make arrangements to \npay the account in full. (GE 2) \n \n \nSOR 1.g is a collection account for the same debt that is listed in 1.d. However, \nthe amount is $296. He stated that he would pay when he was able. (Tr. 23) He \nbelieves they were two separate accounts. (GE 2) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1. h, a collection account for $600, Applicant stated that it has been \npaid. (Tr. 24) He submitted documentation that reflected a payment of $25 that was \nmade on October 6, 2018, showing a balance of $149.32. During his 2017 investigative \ninterview, he noted that there were two different accounts and that he cannot remember \nwhich one he has paid in full. \n \n \nThe amended SOR 1.i represents a paper that Applicant brought to the hearing. \nIt is a letter dated November 21, 2018, showing a payment agreement for state taxes. \nThe payment plan was established for a period of 16 months paying $105.63 a month. \n(GE 6) At the hearing, Applicant explained that he has been paying every month. (Tr. \n53) He had no documentation to support his claim. \n \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under AG \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b that Applicant purchased marijuana on or \nabout October 2017, and information set below under criminal conduct. \n \n \nSOR 2.a alleges and Applicant admits that he purchased marijuana in October \n2017. He explained that he was buying the marijuana for his girlfriend. He was \ninstructed to stop at a rest stop off a major highway, where he purchased the marijuana \n($60) for his friend. (Tr. 58) As he was driving home, he was stopped by a police officer \n\n \n4 \n \nfor tinted windows. (GE 2, Tr. 62) The officer searched the car and found the marijuana \nin the glove compartment. Applicant stated that he does not use marijuana or any illegal \ndrugs. (Tr. 62) Applicant received a criminal citation and made a plea agreement. (GE \n5) He spent a night in jail. He has had this expunged from his record. He no longer \nassociates with that friend. He understands that this was a \u201cdumb mistake.\u201d  He did not \nreport this incident to his FSO for fear of losing his job. (Tr. 64) \n \n \nSOR 2.b alleges the criminal information in AG 3.a, that Applicant was charged \nwith possession of marijuana in October 2017. This is the same incident as described \nabove under Guideline H. \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nSOR AG 3.a alleges that Applicant was charged in October 2017 for possession \nof marijuana. This has been discussed as cross-alleged under the above guideline. \n \n \nSOR AG 3.b alleges the information as set forth in subparagraph 2.a. Again, this \nis the same incident in October 2017 to which Applicant admitted. \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nSOR AG 4.a cross alleges the information as set forth under paragraph 2.a and \n3.a (drug involvement and criminal conduct) as adverse personal conduct under this \nguideline. This is the same information that has been addressed above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his testimony and his credit reports \nestablish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to \n\n \n6 \n \nsatisfy debts\u201d), 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and 19(f) (\u201cfailure \nto file of fraudulently file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to \npay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d) \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \nApplicant admitted and his credit reports confirm that he has been indebted for a \nperiod of time. He has been paying some child support but produced no documentation \nto confirm his assertion. Applicant was unemployed in 2009, but has been steadily \nemployed since 2009. However, he has not acted responsibly. He has not received \ncredit counseling nor does he use a budget. He submitted two receipts for a payment to \ntwo different accounts. Applicant submitted an agreement with the state as to payment \nof taxes dated November 2018, but there is no indication that he has paid any of the \n$1,596. There is no indication if these were the only two payments. Due to the lack of \nevidentiary evidence submitted by Applicant, it is impossible to state that there are \ngood-faith efforts or that his financial situation is under control. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply in this case. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant admits that he purchased marijuana in October 2017 for his girlfriend. \nHe was arrested and charged with purchase of marijuana and possession of marijuana \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are established. \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n\n \n8 \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s incident was on one occasion, in 2017, when he made an extremely \npoor decision and bought marijuana for his girlfriend. He has not used any illegal drugs. \nHe does not associate with anyone who uses marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged in October 2017 for possession and \npurchase of marijuana for his girlfriend. AG \u00b6 31(b) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred in 2017. He has not had any arrests since. \nI find that so much time has elapsed since his criminal conduct occurred that it does not \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Since 2017, he \nhas established a good employment record with his current defense contractor. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \nI find that AG \u00b6 16(c) is mitigated under 17(c). The SOR allegations are cross- \nalleged as under 2.a and 3.a above. He admitted that he made a poor decision.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, H, J, and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified at the hearing. He goes to work each day and tries to \nsupport his family. He knows he has made mistakes in the past. He realizes it was \ndumb to agree to purchase marijuana for his girlfriend. He was credible in that he does \nnot use illegal drugs. He had the charge expunged. He has tried to pay on some bills, \nbut has not sufficient income. He stated that he lost paperwork in a car accident and did \nnot submit sufficient documentation to mitigate the financial security concerns. His 2017 \ncriminal incident was a one-time event.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under drug involvement and substance misuse, criminal \nconduct, and personal conduct, but not financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant received the FORM on September 5, 2018, and \nhad 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Applicant provided no response to the FORM. The Government\u2019s evidence, \nidentified as Items 1 through 7, is admitted into evidence without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 17, 2019.  \n02/06/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He obtained his general equivalency diploma (GED) in \n2002 and his master welder\u2019s license in 2007. Applicant has been employed as a \nmaster welder by a federal contractor since 2017. He reports no military service and he \nmarried in May 2016. Applicant has two daughters, age 3 months, and 10 years old. In \nsection 22 (Police Record) of his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) \nor security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed an arrest for driving under the \ninfluence (DUI) in July 2012. He pled guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving in \nApril 2013. He completed probation and community service; paid fines and costs; and \nattended mandatory, court-ordered DUI-counseling sessions one day each week from \nApril to October 2013. He disclosed another arrest for DUI in November 2016.    \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was also arrested for DUI and criminal mischief \nin July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant pled no contest to reduced charges of reckless \ndriving and criminal mischief in October 2005, and he was sentenced to one year \nprobation and ordered to complete a DUI level one program. Applicant admitted all of \nthe allegations in the SOR in his answer to the SOR in July 2018. (Item 3) He also \nadmitted to five other driving offenses including: driving while license suspended in \n2006, 2008, and 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.i) and driving in violation of court-ordered \nlicense restrictions in 2007 and 2013 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g). Additionally, Applicant \nadmitted being charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in January 2007. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c) State court records provided by Department Counsel corroborate Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and confirm his multiple criminal offenses. (Items 6 \u2013 7)  \n \nIn his personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant stated that his latest November \n2016 DUI occurred after he had dinner and three beers with friends and he was pulled \nover by police. Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) was .09 and the state law \nthreshold for DUI is .08 BAC. Again, he paid fines and $2,000 in court costs plus 25 \nhours of community service, and one year probation. He completed mandatory alcohol \nabuse counseling in January 2018, and his license was revoked for one year. \nNonetheless, Applicant continued to drive since he needed to get to work and felt he \nhad no other choice. In 2007, when he was charged with possession of marijuana, it \nwas provided to him at a party. He never purchased or sold marijuana, and claims to \nhave used it only this one time. (Item 5, pp. 20-21)  \n \n \nApplicant denied the cross-alleged violations under Guidelines G and E, at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2 and 3. He ascribes his afore-mentioned mistakes to youthful immaturity in his \nanswer to the SOR. He professes his intent to not re-offend. Applicant provided no \nresponse to the FORM or character references or performance evaluations. He \nprovided no documentary evidence that he attends treatment or Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) or other support groups, or that he has acknowledged his longstanding pattern of \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s June 30, 2017 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) (Item 4), or his personal subject interview (PSI) on February 26, \n2018. (Item 5)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmaladaptive alcohol use. He provided no evidence of modified consumption or \nabstinence from alcohol. \n \n \n \n                                       Policies \n \n \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Administrative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful \nweighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n           The security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n31(a) a pattern of minor offenses; any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \n31(b) evidence, (including but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n.  \n \nApplicant has admitted to three arrests for DUI and possession of drug \nparaphernalia. His admissions are corroborated by the record evidence including court \nrecords provided by Department Counsel, which provide details. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (b) \nhave been established by the Government\u2019s evidence. (Items 5 - 7) The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n          Applicant was arrested for DUI in 2005, 2012, and 2017. His last arrest for driving \non a suspended license was in June 2017, and he was convicted after he completed his \nSCA. This was his fifth arrest for either driving on a suspended license or on a restricted \nlicense. Applicant is incorrigible. While he completed court-ordered alcohol awareness \ncourses at least twice following his DUI arrests, Applicant has apparently not learned \nfrom his earlier mistakes. His conduct, on whole, for over a decade, reflects a flagrant \ndisregard for laws and rules of the road. It is not likely that he will follow rules and \nregulations with respect to handling classified information. AG \u00b6 32 (d) only partially \napplies, if at all.   \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder.  \n \n \nApplicant had three alcohol-related incidents, the DUI arrests in 2005, 2012, and  \n2017. SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c) are applicable.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and, \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \nMy analyses above under Guideline J is the same under this administrative \nguideline G, and are herein incorporated by reference. Applicant has completed two \ncourt-ordered, mandatory DUI courses. Nonetheless, Applicant provided no evidence or \nassurance that he has modified his drinking or that he abstains from alcohol. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 \n(d) partially applies to mitigate the cross-alleged allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a.  \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a pattern of rules violations and his long-term \nconduct indicates an inability or unwillingness to modify his behavior and comply with \nlaws and rules of the road for safe driving. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d)(3) are implicated.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns \ninclude: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \nMy analyses above under Guidelines J and G are the same under this this \nGuideline E, and are herein incorporated by reference. Applicant has completed two \ncourt-ordered, mandatory DUI courses. While AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (d) may have some \napplicability, they are not enough to overcome Applicant\u2019s well-established pattern of \nviolating the law and ignoring rules, such as when he drove drunk three times, and \ndrove with either a restricted or suspended license on five occasions. While some of his \ndriving offenses may be considered minor, the repetitiveness and frequency of his \nviolations show a pattern of bad judgment. Applicant has produced no documentation \nshowing that he has overcome his drinking problem, modified his consumption, or now \npractices abstinence with the aid of AA or other support group.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines. Most importantly, Applicant has not \naddressed the specific allegations in the SOR. He has longstanding and ongoing \ncriminal, alcohol, and driving offenses going back to 2005. He has offered nothing to \nassure the Government that there will be no recurrence. He has not met his burden of \nproduction.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:               \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n Paragraph 2, Guideline G:                      Against Applicant \n \n \n Subparagraph 2.a:                                  Against Applicant \n \n            Paragraph 3, Guideline E:                       Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:                                    Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

She also \nstated that her 2014 Federal income tax returns were ready to file. Her failure to file her \n2014 Federal income returns was not alleged in the SOR. (Item 2)  \n \nDepartment Counsel noted that Applicant claimed that she filed her 2015 and \n2016 Federal income tax returns and that a $2,100 consumer debt was current. He also \nnoted that Applicant failed to provide any documentary evidence that her Federal \nincome tax returns were filed, nor had she provided any documentary evidence that her \n$2,000 in unpaid taxes or her remaining 13 consumer accounts had been paid, were the \nsubject of a payment plan, or were otherwise settled or resolved. \n \n \nApplicant explained that she did not file her 2015 and 2016 Federal income tax \nreturns because she was working as a contractor in Kuwait and was waiting until she \nreturned to the United States to file her returns with a tax preparer familiar with filing \ntaxes on U.S. derived income while employed in a foreign country. Applicant was \nemployed overseas from December 2015 to April 2017. Applicant stated that she \nincurred estimated penalties of $2,200 for filing her 2016 returns after the due date and \nhad set up a payment plan with the IRS. (Items 2, 4) During her OPM PSI, Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nstated that she would set up a payment plan by August 2018 to address her remaining \nSOR debts. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant\u2019s FORM response contained documentation dated March 5, 2018, \nshowing that her 2015 and 2016 Federal income tax returns had been filed, with her \nreceiving respective refunds of $3,741 and $1,337. (Item 7) In that same response, she \nsubmitted documentation that her first $250 installment had been debited from her \nchecking account towards her $2,000 delinquent tax debt on October 9, 2018. (Item 7). \nIt is unclear from the record why Applicant\u2019s refunds were not applied to her delinquent \ntax debt.  \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM discussed specific shortcomings of Applicant\u2019s \nSOR answer, and emphasized long-standing DOHA case law concerning the necessity \nfor applicants to provide mitigating documentation. Except as discussed above, \nApplicant\u2019s SOR Answer and FORM Response contained no documentation that \naddressed her remaining SOR debts. \n \nApplicant concluded her response to the FORM by stating that her personal debt \nhad not compromised her integrity to hold a security clearance and that she had not \nengaged in any illegal or questionable acts to generate funds nor had she had sources \nof unknown income. (Item 7) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n \n Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 19 provides four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\u201d (c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d Based on the evidence contained in the record, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c) and \n19(f) are applicable. Further review is necessary.   \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six potentially mitigating conditions under these facts: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n  \nThe Appeal Board explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility to prove applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. (You already said this above)  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).(deletion cures orphan) \n \nApplicant has not yet fully established any of these conditions except for AG \u00b6 \n20(g). The principal reason, of being deployed overseas, proffered by Applicant for not \ntimely meeting her 2015 and 2016 filing responsibility does not constitute good faith as \ncontemplated by the Directive, or as defined by the DOHA Appeal Board precedent, and \naccordingly does not fully mitigate the security concern raised by her financial conduct. \nApplicant avers that while working in Kuwait, she decided to wait until she returned to \nthe United States to deal with her taxes. This belies the fact that Kuwait is a developed \nand modern country offering international telephone and internet connectivity as well as \npostal and commercial mail capabilities; all of which, singularly and collectively, could \nand should have been used by Applicant to timely prepare and file her tax returns. \nThere is no evidence in the record documenting that Applicant sought or received an \nextension to file her tax returns late. \n \nAlthough Applicant filed her 2015 and 2016 Federal income tax returns and \nestablished a payment plan to repay her delinquent taxes in 2018, her failure to timely \nfile her tax returns and resolve her delinquent accounts precludes finding she has the \ngood judgment and reliability needed to be cleared for access to classified information. \nApplicant must demonstrate that she has acted reasonably under the circumstances. \nBeyond the statement she provides in her SOR answer, the record does not establish \nwhen or how Applicant intends to resolve the remaining delinquencies. \n \nIn addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate adjudicative \nfactors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the context of the \nwhole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant is presumed to be a mature, \nresponsible citizen.  Nonetheless, without sufficient information, including corroborating \ndocumentation, suggesting that her long-standing financial problems are being \naddressed, doubts remain about her suitability for access to classified information. \nProtection of the national interest is the principal focus of this adjudication. Accordingly, \nthose doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \n \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record, but failed to submit sufficient \nevidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding her \ncircumstances, articulate her position, or mitigate the financial security concerns. She \nfailed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation regarding her \nefforts to address her delinquent debt. Absent such information, financial considerations \nsecurity concerns remain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant national security eligibility.

The foreign influence guideline is \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. Eligibility for security clearance access is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 28, 2017, Applicant signed and certified an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) application for a security clearance. \nThe Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the preliminary affirmative findings \nrequired to grant a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), dated July 3, 2018, detailing security concerns under the guideline for foreign \ninfluence (Guideline B). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), June 8, 2017.  \n \n\n  2 \n \nApplicant provided her notarized answer on July 27, 2018. The case was \nassigned to me on November 1, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 21, 2019, for a hearing on March 14, \n2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s three exhibits and \nApplicant\u2019s 22 exhibits (AE) A-M were entered into evidence without objection. The \nGovernment\u2019s administrative notice memorandum and source documents, and \nApplicant\u2019s administrative notice memorandum and source documents were marked as \nhearing exhibits (HE) 1 and HE 2, respectively. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.), and \nthe record closed on March 26, 2019.  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI have taken administrative notice of certain relevant facts related to Pakistan. \nThese facts come from source material published by the Department of State and \nDepartment of Justice. The source material includes joint statements, fact sheets, and \nremarks published by the White House, the Secretary of State (through the Department \nof State), and the prime minister of Pakistan, in 2010, 2013, 2014, and 2015. The facts \nare limited to matters of general knowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s uncle (SOR 1.a) and her friend (SOR 1.b) are \ncitizens and residents of Pakistan. Applicant admitted both allegations with \nexplanations. She requested a hearing.  \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. She married a naturalized U.S. citizen in December \n2016. He has worked for a U.S. federal agency since 2011 and has a security \nclearance. She received her bachelor\u2019s degree in April 2005 (psychology) and two \nmaster\u2019s degrees in May 2007 (psychology) and May 2011 (mass communications). \nShe has been working for a defense contractor as a research analyst since September \n2013. She received a promotion to a principal analyst in 2016, and is being considered \nfor a position as task leader. She held a security clearance from 2012 to August 2014, \nwhen the clearance was \u201cdisapproved.\u201d (GE 1 at 9-45, 60-61; Answer to SOR; AE A; Tr. \n22-26, 31-32, 37) \n \nSOR 1.a \u2013 Applicant\u2019s uncle is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. He is a doctor \n(pulmonologist) in the Pakistan Military Medical Corps. This individual is actually \nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s cousin, not her uncle. Applicant explained that growing up in the \nPakistani culture one refers to older relatives as an aunt or uncle. When Applicant \nstarted filling out security applications, she continued to refer to her mother\u2019s cousin as \nuncle. He served as a doctor for the Pakistan Military Medical Corps from the 1990s to \nabout 2012, then he moved to another country for additional training for about a year. In \n2013, he returned to the Pakistan Military Medical Corps because Applicant testified \nthat he has been in the Corps for about 20 years. Her contact with him is four times a \nyear through social media and phone. Her last face-to-face contact with him was in April \n2017, when she lodged at his home for a couple of days. Applicant sent an email to him \n\n  3 \n \nin November 2018. He has never asked Applicant about her job or information relating \nto her job.

She is one of \nApplicant\u2019s closest friends since high school (circa 1996). She is employed as a \nteacher. As of May 2016, Applicant was contacting her friend about four to five times a \nyear. The friend came to the United States in 2012 for medical treatment. During her \nstay, the friend resided with her sister in another state. Applicant last spoke to her friend \nabout six months before the hearing. (GE 1 at 43-44; GE 3 at 2; answer to SOR; Tr. 56-\n59)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 58 years old. She is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and lives in \nanother state. She is employed as a mental health clinician. (GE 1 at 35-36; GE 3 at 1; \nTr. 33) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is 69 years old and is a Pakistani citizen, who resides in the \nUnited States. In a May 2016 signed affidavit, Applicant indicated to an investigator from \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that she was unaware of her father\u2019s \nlocation due to her parents\u2019 divorce in approximately 2001. Her last social media contact \nwith him was in 2009, when they discussed her brother\u2019s personal problems. While in \nPakistan, her father was employed by a pharmaceutical company. In the United States, \nhe was driving a taxi. (GE 1 at 36-37; GE 3 at 1) \n \nApplicant\u2019s 30-year-old brother, a lawyer, is a citizen of Pakistan living in the \nUnited States in another state. In December 2017, she did not know his citizenship \nstatus and was estranged from him for about seven years. Applicant did not believe that \nher brother was affiliated with any foreign government. (GE 1 at 38-39) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are naturalized U.S. citizens living in \nanother state. (GE 2 at 4) Applicant\u2019s husband has several relatives (not listed in the \nSOR) who are citizens and residents of Bangladesh. These persons are identified in the \nrelatives\u2019 matrix in her January 2018 answers to interrogatories (GE 2 at 9-18). Neither \nApplicant nor her husband have had any contact with the first nine relatives since 1992. \n(GE 2 at 9-12) Applicant or her husband expect to contact the tenth relative every two or \nthree years by email and phone, with their last contact occurring in 2017. (GE 2 at 12) \nThe last contact with the relative listed at number 11 was in 1985. There has been no \ncontact with the 12th relative. (GE 2 at 12) The last contact with the next eight relatives \nwas in 1992. (GE 2 at 13-15) The last contact with her husband\u2019s 21st and 22nd listed \nrelative was in 2016, with future contact expected to occur once every ten years. (GE 2 \nat 16) The last contact with the 23rd relative was in 2016, with no expected future \ncontact. They have had no contact with the 24rd relative. Applicant or her husband\u2019s last \ncontact with his 25th relative was in 2016, with no contact since. (GE 2 at 17) Their last \ncontact with the 26th relative was in 2017, with future contacts expected to occur once \nevery 10 years. Neither Applicant nor her husband have had any contact with the last \nfour relatives listed. (GE 2 at 17-18) From the 30 relatives listed on the matrix, \n\n  4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s only recent contact was with the 10th and 26th relative. Applicant or her \nhusband\u2019s last contact with the tenth relative was in 2017, with the frequency of future \ncontact occurring once every two to three years. The last contact with the 26th relative \nwas also in 2017, with the frequency of expected future contact expected to occur once \nevery 10 years. None of Applicant or her husband\u2019s relatives are in a position to be \nexploited by a foreign power that could force Applicant or her husband to choose \nbetween loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States. (GE 2 at 9-18, 31)  \n \nNeither Applicant nor her husband have any financial interests in a foreign \ncountry. They do not receive any income from a foreign government or entity. \nConversely, they do not owe money or have a legal obligation to any foreign \ngovernment or entity. If Applicant suspects someone is trying to exploit her or influence \nher through her family member, or in any other fashion, she will resist and refuse the \nefforts to influence her and report the attempt to her facility security officer (FSO) or the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), should the situation require that action. (GE 2 at \n22-26, 30; Tr. 51-52) \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial interests in the United States include a home she and her \nhusband purchased in November 2018 for approximately $572,000. According to their \npersonal financial statement (PFS), dated February 11, 2019, their combined monthly \nincome was $10,600. Their assets totaled $1,092,000. Their combined monthly \nexpenses were $7,000, with a monthly remainder of $3,600. Applicant is a registered \nU.S. voter. (AE J; AE K1-K4; AE L) \n \nCharacter Evidence  \n \n \nA vice president, three coworkers, one former coworker, and a manager provided \ncharacter references for Applicant. The vice president of her company believes that she \nqualifies for access to classified information because of her conscientiousness. (AE E1) \nHer coworker since 2013, who became her supervisor in 2016, has worked on 20 \nnational security projects with her. She is devoted to following the rules and complying \nwith protocol. She receives regular security briefings and has demonstrated she would \nreport attempts to exploit her. (AE E2) A coworker of five years finds Applicant honest \nand reliable, and a person who will not succumb to pressure. (AE E3) A coworker who \nhas known Applicant for four years knows that she follows the rules and would report \nattempts to manipulate her. (AE E4) Applicant\u2019s friend of eight years, who worked with \nher on a job in 2010, and has continued a friendship with her, considers her to be \nhonest and reliable. (AE E5) Applicant\u2019s colleague, who served as her manager on \nseveral projects, considers her to be a valuable employee with integrity and job \nperformance as her strong points. (AE E6) Applicant\u2019s job performance for evaluation \nperiods of 2015, 2016, and 2017 have been good to excellent. (AE B1, B2, B3) \nApplicant received a letter of commendation for her work on two projects in 2014. (AE \nC) \n \n \n \n\n  5 \n \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Pakistan \n \nPakistan is a parliamentary Islamic republic with significant internal problems \ncaused by terrorist organizations concentrated in several locations within the country. \nAs of 2014, parts of Pakistan\u2019s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa province, and Balochistan province were regarded as a safe haven for \nterrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, \nLasahkar I Jhangvi, and the Afghan Taliban. These groups create ongoing security \nproblems by targeting western interests, U.S. citizens, senior Pakistani officials, minority \npolitical groups, and religious entities. In September 2012, the United States officially \ndeclared the Haqqani Network a foreign terrorist organization. Operations in 2014 by \nthe Pakistani military against some of the terror groups had only marginal success.  \n \nThe human rights record of Pakistan is not good. Extrajudicial killings, torture, \nand disappearances have been reported, along with intrusive government surveillance \nof politicians, political activists, and the media. Government and police corruption, \nsexual harassment, and gender discrimination are persistent problems. Pakistani \ngovernment authorities seldom punish government officials for human rights violations.  \n \nPolices \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n\n  6 \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe nature of a country\u2019s government, its relationship to the United States, and \nits human rights record, are relevant in evaluating the chances that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government pressure or influence. As the guideline \nindicates, the country in question must be considered. Terrorist organizations, including \nthe Taliban and al-Qaeda, continue to operate against the United States and Pakistani \ninterests within Pakistan. The country has a poor human rights record that is \nexacerbated by the country\u2019s terrorism and violence. When evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nties to foreign family members, the totality of an applicant\u2019s foreign family ties as well as \neach individual family tie must be considered. Conditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying include: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \n \n \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do not \nautomatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation. The presence of terrorist and insurgent organizations, and the unstable \nsecurity situation within Pakistan intensify the heightened risk of foreign manipulation \nand exploitation. Applicant\u2019s second cousin and friend are citizens and residents of \nPakistan. She contacts them through social media or by phone about four times a year. \nShe traveled to Pakistan once in 2012. On her visit to the country in April 2017, she \nstayed with her second cousin for two days. Overall, the level of contacts that Applicant \nhas with her second cousin and her friend create a heightened risk of foreign influence \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a). AG \u00b6 7(b) is applicable because Applicant\u2019s connections to her second \ncousin brother and female friend create a potential conflict of interest between her \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and her desire to \nhelp her second cousin and her friend by providing that information.  \n \n \n\n  7 \n \n \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant has ties and regular contacts with her second cousin and friend in \nPakistan. In view of these contacts, and the terrorist elements that target Pakistani \ncivilians and U.S. interests in the country, Applicant could be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the family interests and the interests of the United States. AG \n\u00b6 8(a) does not apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. Applicant has developed longstanding bonds to the United \nStates. These bonds began when Applicant migrated to the United States in June 1996. \nShe became a U.S. citizen in October 2004. In April 2005, she earned her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in psychology at an American university. In May 2007 and May 2011, she \ngraduated from U.S. institutions with a master\u2019s degree in psychology, followed by a \nmaster\u2019s degree in mass communications. She has worked professionally for her U.S. \nemployer as a research analyst since September 2013, then received a promotion to a \nprincipal analyst in 2016, and currently anticipates a promotion to task leader. She \nmarried her husband (a naturalized U.S. citizen) in December 2016. Her husband has \nbeen working for a U.S. federal agency since 2011. She and her husband purchased \ntheir home in December 2018. Her closest ties in the United States are to her husband, \nher mother, and her husband\u2019s parents, all U.S. citizens. In sum, Applicant can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict in favor of U.S. interests.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is inapplicable since Applicant did not rebut the presumption that her \nrelationships with her second cousin and friend are neither casual nor infrequent.  \n \n \n \n \n\n  8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence guideline in the context \nof the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the context of \nthe general factors of the whole-person concept. I considered that Applicant moved to \nthe United States in 1996. She became a U.S. citizen in 2004. By 2011, Applicant had \nattained a bachelor\u2019s degrees and two master\u2019s degrees from American universities. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s marriage to a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2016, and \ntheir U.S. net worth over $1,000,000.  \n \nI considered the exemplary compliments that Applicant received from her \ncoworkers and managers regarding her job performance, her competence in \nsafeguarding classified information, and their complete confidence in her to report any \nattempt to pressure or manipulate her. I considered Applicant\u2019s understanding of the \nadditional opportunities she has in America for growth educationally, professionally, and \nsocially as a woman. All of Applicant\u2019s financial interests are located in America. I \nconsidered the unlisted foreign family members of Applicant\u2019s husband that are \nidentified in GE at 9-18. Applicant or her husband have had no recent contact with most \nof them and their contact with the other relatives has been sporadic at best. Given \nApplicant\u2019s strong bonds that she has developed to the United States over the past 22 \nyears, I conclude that her problematic relationships with her brother and her father will \nnot disturb her determination to resolve all conflicts in favor of the U.S interest. \nConsidering the evidence from an overall commonsense point of view, Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B):  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n\n  9 \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b:   \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Schacter, Esq. \n______________ \n08/30/2019\nDecision \n______________ \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \nThe amount of time that has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s security violation, and the \ncircumstances surrounding the violation are insufficient to overcome the security concern, \ngiven the nature and seriousness of the transgression. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 24, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline K, handling protected information, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nOn September 11, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting subparagraph 1.a, \nas cross-alleged in subparagraph 2.a, and denying subparagraphs 2.b and 2.c. He \n\n2 \n \nrequested a hearing, whereupon on December 10, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On \nMarch 18, 2019, DOHA scheduled the hearing for April 10, 2019.  \n \nBefore the hearing, Department Counsel provided Applicant\u2019s counsel with six \nexhibits (Government Exhibit (GE) 1 through GE 6) that he planned to introduce at the \nhearing. Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to the admissibility of all of the exhibits except GE 1. \nAfter considering pre-hearing briefs from both parties, and arguments at the hearing \nregarding this matter, I admitted GE 1, sustained Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to exclude \nGE 2, and admitted GE 3 through GE 6, denying his motion to exclude them.  \n \nDepartment Counsel then moved to continue the hearing to allow him the \nopportunity to procure the testimony of a witness to authenticate GE 2. Counsel for \nApplicant objected. I granted the motion in part, continuing the case for Department \nCounsel to procure the authenticating witness, and denied it in part, allowing Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel to present the testimony of the two character witnesses who had come to the \nhearing to testify.  \n \nBefore continuing the hearing, I also admitted four exhibits, identified as Hearing \nExhibits (HE) I through HE IV. HE I and HE II are copies of e-mail correspondence \nbetween the parties and me. HE III is the National Industrial Security Program Operating \nManual (February 2006, Incorporating Change 2, May 18, 2016). HE IV is Chapter 5, \nSection 1 of DOD 5220.22-M (February 28, 2006).    \n \nOn March 18, 2018, DOHA scheduled the completion of the hearing for June 3, \n2019. The hearing was held as rescheduled. After considering the testimony of the \nauthenticating witness, I admitted GE 2, over Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s renewed objection. I \nalso received six Applicant exhibits identified as AE A through AE F. At counsel\u2019s request, I \nmarked another court exhibit, for identification purpose only, as HE V, DOD Instruction \n7050.01, effective October 17, 2017.  \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for ten days to allow parties to \nsupplement their closing arguments. On June 5, 2019, I received a supplementary closing \nargument from Applicant\u2019s counsel, and on June 6, 2019, I received a response from \nDepartment Counsel. I appended the e-mailed copies of these submissions as HE I at \npages 46 through 50. The transcript (Tr.) of the first part of the hearing was received on \nApril 30, 2019. The transcript of the second part of the hearing was received on June 13, \n2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old married man with two teenage children. He earned a \nBachelor of Science degree in architecture in 1994, and an associate\u2019s degree in project \nmanagement in 2007. (AE A at 2) He has been working in the information technology field \nsince 1984, and has been a program manager since 2003. He was first granted a security \nclearance in 2006. (AE A at 2) \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant is an engineer who installs and upgrades fiber security systems. (AE C at \n1) His current supervisor, who has worked with him in various capacities for 34 years, \ncharacterizes him as an exceptional engineer who performs his duties above and beyond \nthe scope of work required by their clients. (AE C at 1)  \n \n \nApplicant worked for his previous employer from 2010 to 2013. (GE 1 at 11) He \nsupervised a team of five engineers and ten technicians as part of a project to upgrade the \nnetwork systems. (Tr. 75; GE 2) The project was two pronged. It first involved going to \nseveral rooms to inventory the network systems and determine which needed to be \nphysically replaced, then replacing the systems that needed to be upgraded. (Tr. 89) \nApplicant\u2019s team worked on the identification and inventory prong of the project. (Tr. 89, \n106) Each day, team members went to multiple classified rooms and security closets. Entry \nto these rooms was controlled by up to two combination locks, depending upon the \nclassification level. (Tr. 90) \n \n \nEach day, Applicant went to a swipe-access-controlled sensitive compartmented \ninformation facility (SCIF) to retrieve the combinations. The combinations that controlled \naccess to SCIFs were in a separate room than the lock combinations for the rooms that \nhoused lower-level classified information. (Tr. 105) Each of the combinations had three \nnumbers.  \n \n \nBecause the numbers to the combinations were classified, Applicant could not write \nthem down. Instead, he had to memorize them. After retrieving the combinations and \nmemorizing them, he would pass them along to his team members, who would then go to \nthe respective rooms to execute their assignments. (Tr. 134-135) Combinations could not \nbe disclosed in unclassified facilities.  \n \n \nMemorizing all of these numbers in the proper order was challenging. At most, \nApplicant had to memorize \u201c30 different numbers in a specific order, couple[d] with nine to \neighteen different combinations.\u201d (Tr. 106 -107) If he forgot a combination, he had to return \nto the room where he had originally received it. This could slow the project by 30 minutes. \n(Tr. 115) In late 2012, an engineer who worked at Applicant\u2019s company suggested that he \nstore the combination codes in his personal cell phone. (Tr. 117, 127) He provided \nApplicant with encryption software to protect the information which Applicant downloaded \nonto his phone. Applicant did not check with his FSO or supervisor about whether the \nencryption software had been approved for use by either his employer or the agency. (Tr. \n142)  \n \n \nUsing the encryption software, Applicant began inputting the classified combinations \ninto his personal cell phone. (Tr. 127) He would later refer to the cell phone for the \ncombinations to help remember them when he provided them to his subordinates. The \ndisclosure of these classified combinations to his subordinates occurred in an unclassified, \nopen office space. (GE 2 at 2) Applicant thought the room was classified because it was \nsecured by a special lock. (Tr. 129) It is unclear from the record how long Applicant \nobtained and shared classified combinations in this fashion. \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nIn November 2012, the DOD\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office received an anonymous \ncomplaint about Applicant\u2019s security practices regarding the classified combinations. (GE 2 \nat 1; AE F) The anonymous complaint also alleged that Applicant wrote classified \ncombinations in a black book. Applicant denied this allegation about the black book and the \ninvestigation includes no finding regarding this allegation. (Tr. 123, 139) \n \n \nThe complaint was referred to the facility and personnel security division of the \ndepartment where Applicant was performing his contract work. The complaint prompted an \ninvestigation that began in April 2013. (GE 6, Enclosure (Enc.) 6; AE F) Subsequently, the \nthen-chief security manager interviewed Applicant. During the interview, he \u201cclearly and \nfreely admitted that he did house those combinations, and he did disclose them to his \npersonnel . . . .\u201d (Tr. 24)  \n \n \nAccording to the former chief security manager, Applicant and the other contractors \nreceived security briefings every month. (Tr. 25) Applicant contended that the security \ntraining he received was generic and did not address the subject of storing combinations \non personal phones. (Tr. 114) Moreover, he contended storing information on his phone \nenabled him to get more combinations to his teammates more quickly, without having to \nreturn multiple times to the rooms where he was required to go to retrieve them. By \npromoting efficiency, Applicant \u201cthought it was for the betterment of the team.\u201d (Tr. 115) \n \n \nAfter completing the investigation in May of 2013, the chief security manager \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s actions caused a compromise of classified combinations. \nAdditionally, he concluded that \u201ccontract security officers [were] not properly briefing \ncontractor personnel on their security responsibilities.\u201d (GE 2 at 2; AE F) Ultimately he \nrecommended that Applicant\u2019s access to classified information be terminated. \n \n \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s security violation, the agency had to change all of the \ncombinations. Changing the 400 to 500 combinations required 192 work-hours.  (Tr. 27) \n \n \nThe chief security manager who conducted the investigation testified at the hearing. \nHe stated that his investigation into Applicant\u2019s improper handling of classified information \nalso included reviewing the guidance involving memorizing multiple combinations. (Tr. 52) \nAs part of the review process, the chief security manager and his team consulted with \nvarious work groups that needed access to classified spaces in an effort to ascertain \u201chow \n[they] could actually assist these people and still keep from having compromises.\u201d (Tr. 55) \nHe concluded that the procedure which involved contractors memorizing as many \ncombinations as possible was not a good practice. (Tr. 53) Consequently, the security \nmanager and his staff developed a new policy where \u201cyou would have to come to the \nsecurity office, make your case for a number of combinations and we would be the ones to \nvet and provide those combinations to you in our classified facilities.\u201d (Tr. 55)   \n \n \nOn May 22, 2013, Applicant\u2019s employer placed him on unpaid administrative leave, \npending its investigation. (GE 6, Enc. 3) This decision was reached because Applicant, \nabsent a security clearance, was \u201cnot permitted to complete [his] duties as outlined in [his] \nemployment agreement . . .\u201d (GE 6, Enc. 3) As part of the company\u2019s out-processing \n\n5 \n \nprocedures, he was required to turn in all of his building access keys and badges, and to \nattend a security debriefing. (GE 6, Enc. 4) In addition, he was instructed that his health \nbenefits were set to terminate within ten days of the unpaid administrative leave notice. \n(GE 6, Enc. 3) The memo setting forth these instructions does not characterize Applicant\u2019s \npending departure as a termination. \n \n \nOn March 1, 2016, the FSO of Applicant\u2019s former employer responded to a request \nfor background information received from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as \npart of a new clearance investigation. (GE 6; AE F) In his response, the FSO noted that \nApplicant\u2019s continued assertion that he did not receive the proper training to handle the \nclassified information \u201cconfirms that he was not, and is not capable of handling classified \ninformation because common sense dictates the information he was handling was \nclassified and his handling of it . . .  was improper.\u201d (AE 6 at 1) \n \n \nAccording to an individual whom Applicant supervised on a job prior to the job where \nthe security violation occurred, he was a \u201cserious-minded professional\u201d who made \ninformation security \u201chis highest priority.\u201d (AE C at 4) He corrected this former subordinate \non one occasion, and taught him how \u201cto keep multiple sources of information, floor plans \nand cut-sheets, securely stored separately, and not together.\u201d (AE C at 4) His former \nsupervisor at the job where the security violation occurred characterizes it as an anomaly \nthat does not reflect Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information. (AE C at 5) He \nfrequently observed Applicant mentoring subordinates on physical security issues. (AE C at \n5)  \n \n \n \nAccording to one of Applicant\u2019s former coworkers who was involved with his \ntermination, Applicant was removed from his position, pending an investigation into the \nalleged security violation and because there were no other positions available in the \ncompany that were commensurate with his experience, credentials, or compensation. (AE \nD at 1)  He considers Applicant to be \u201chonest, very detailed, and passionate about his \nwork.\u201d (AE D at 1) \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in February 2016. In response \nto the question whether he had ever been fired, quit after being told he would be fired, left \nby mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct or unsatisfactory \nperformance, he answered \u201cyes,\u201d explaining that he left the position by mutual agreement, \nas discussed above, for \u201calleged violation of security procedures that [he] had never \nreceived proper training.\u201d (GE 1 at 12)  \n \n \nAnother question on the February 2016 security application asked whether Applicant \nhad ever received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined \nfor misconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security policy. He answered, \u201cyes,\u201d \nagain referencing the position that he left in 2013, explaining that he was punished for an \n\u201calleged violation of security procedures that [he] was never trained on.\u201d (GE 1 at 13)  \n \n \nA government investigator interviewed Applicant in March 2017. He told the agent \nthat he left his previous employer by mutual agreement following the security violation \n\n6 \n \nallegations, and that he was eligible for re-hire. (Tr.  152-153) He believed this to be the \ncase because he never was told that he could not return. \n \n \nApplicant has continued to take security trainings over the years. In March 2019, he \ncompleted a counterintelligence training, and later that month, he completed an annual \nsecurity awareness refresher course. (AE D3 at 1; AE D4 at 1) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied together with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n\n7 \n \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), as set forth below:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concerns about handing protected information are set forth in AG \u00b6 13: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information \u2013 which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information \u2013 raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to \nsafeguard such information, and is a serious security concern \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s storage of classified lock combination codes on his personal cell phone, \nand his later disclosure of these combinations to subordinates in an unclassified area \ntrigger the application of the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 34: \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location;   \n \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium; and \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nThe chief security officer, who investigated Applicant\u2019s security violations, \nconcluded, among other things, that contract security officers were not properly briefing \n\n8 \n \ncontractor personnel on their security responsibilities. Moreover, he testified that the \nprocedure which involved contractors memorizing as many combinations as possible was \nnot a good practice, and that Applicant\u2019s case was one of the catalysts for reforming the \nprocedure for contractors to obtain access to locked, classified rooms. This raises the \nissue of whether AG \u00b6 35(c), \u201cthe security violations were due to improper or inadequate \ntraining or unclear instructions,\u201d applies. \n \n \nRegardless of the quality of security clearance training that Applicant received, or \nthe efficacy of the procedure governing the retrieval of classified combination locks, it is \naxiomatic that storing combinations to locks securing rooms that contain classified \ninformation on one\u2019s personal cell phone, constitutes an improper handling of classified \ninformation. AG \u00b6 35(c) does not apply.  \n \n \nIn 2019, Applicant took two refresher security courses. AG \u00b6 35(b), \u201cthe individual \nresponded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a \npositive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities,\u201d applies. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security violation occurred six years ago. However it was egregious, as it \ncompromised the combinations to more than 400 locks, all of which had to be replaced at a \ncost of 192 work hours. Given the nature and scope of his transgression, I am unable to \nconclude that AG \u00b6 35(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has \nhappened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d applies. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern related to handling \nprotected information. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s conduct is disqualifying under this guideline for the \nsame reasons as they are disqualifying under the guideline governing the handling of \nprotected information, as explained above. Applicant\u2019s alleged falsifications, as alleged in \nsubparagraphs 2.b and 2.c, raise the issue of whether the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 16 apply: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \n\n9 \n \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cyes,\u201d in response to the questions on the security clearance \napplication asking him whether he had either left a position under adverse circumstances, \nor whether he had ever been disciplined, reprimanded, or suspended from a job. He also \nidentified the employer involved and the date of his departure. His assertion that the \nsecurity violations occurred because of a lack of proper training was an expression of his \nsubjective belief, not a falsification. I conclude Applicant did not falsify his 2016 security \nclearance application. \n \n \nGiven the testimony of one of the individuals involved with Applicant\u2019s termination \nfrom his employment, vouching for his honesty, I am also persuaded that he was not \nattempting to mislead the investigator in March 2017 when he stated he left the job by \nmutual agreement. I conclude there are no personal conduct issues related to falsification. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mishandling of protected information is disqualifying, as cross-alleged in \nParagraph 2, for the same reasons it is disqualifying under the guideline governing the \nhandling of protected information, as discussed earlier in the decision. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n  \n \nApplicant has many positive attributes. Historically, he has been a good performer \non the job. Many individuals, including an individual from his former company where \nApplicant left after his clearance was suspended who was involved in his termination, \nvouched for his character. Moreover, contrary to the SOR allegations, he did not intend to \nmislead anyone in the investigative process when he completed his security clearance \napplication and later, when he interviewed with an agent. Conversely, mishandling of \nclassified information strikes at the heart of the security process, and as such, requires \napplicants to overcome a very heavy burden to mitigate. When viewed in this context, \nApplicant\u2019s security violation is simply too egregious for me to conclude without any doubt \nthat such a violation would not recur in the future. I conclude that Applicant has failed to \ncarry the burden. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n10 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b \u2013 2.c: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.)\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended. DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Security Executive\nAgent, Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8,\n2017.\n03/25/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 26, 2018, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to  me on January 9. 2019, and  scheduled for hearing on February\n13, 2019. A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nAt the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of three exhibits (GEs 1-3).\nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit (AE A). Both the Government\u2019s\nexhibits and Applicant\u2019s exhibit were admitted without objection. The transcript was\nreceived on February 26, 2019.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline E. Applicant allegedly (a) falsified his electronic questionnaires\nfor electronic processing (e-QIP) of October 2017 by misrepresenting the circumstances\nof his leaving his employment (i.e., by mutual agreement) and failing to acknowledge he\nwas fired in May 2015 due to having an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate, in\nviolation of company policy; (b) falsified his e-QIP of October 2017 by omitting his use of\nmarijuana in October 2010 and in December 2013; and (c) falsified his personal subject\ninterview (PSI) with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) by\nfailing to disclose his firing in May 2015 due to an inappropriate relationship with a\ncoworker, in violation of company policy and his illegal marijuana use in October 2010\nand December 2013.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with\nexplanations. He claimed to have attached a termination letter from his former employer,\nbut no attachments were in the file. Whether the attachment was administratively \nremoved in preparation for the hearing is unclear.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old information technology (IT) consultant for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nBackground\nApplicant never married and has no children. (GE 1) He attended college classes\nin the Ukraine between August 2010 and June 2014 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in\nJune 2014 in computer engineering. (GE 1) He immigrated to the United States in 2005\nand became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2012. (GEs 1-3) Applicant reported no\nmilitary service. \nSince April 2012, Applicant has been self-employed as an IT consultant. (GE 1)\nContemporaneously with his self-employment as an IT consultant (since September\n2017), he has worked as a Russian interpreter for a Russian linguist firm. (GE 1)\n2\n\nBetween October 2011 and August 2013, he worked as an IT team lead for an IT firm.\n(GE 1) He reported self-employment as an IT consultant between April 2007 and April\n2010. (GEs 1-3)\nEmployment termination\nRecords confirm that Applicant was terminated from his employment with a\ndefense contractor (Company A) in May 2015 on the stated grounds that he had an\ninappropriate relationship with a subordinate, in violation of company policy. (AE A; Tr.\n25-26) His termination and reasons are summarized in an email forwarded to him in May\n2015 by his manager. (AE A) as follows: (a) Applicant was found to have engaged in a\n\u201csignificant personal relationship with another employee, resulting in a conflict of\ninterest,\u201d and (b) he failed to notify his human resource office or his manager about the\nexistence of the conflict of interest. (AE A; Tr. 26-27)  \nApplicant never denied the cited bases of his termination. Applicant worked for\nCompany A between June 2013 and May 2015, and was fired over his engaging in a\npersonal romantic relationship with a coworker. (GEs 1 and 3 and AE A; Tr. 25-26)\nDrug use\nApplicant admitted, and records confirmed that he used marijuana in October\n2011 and in December 2013. (GE 3) He self-reported in his PSI that he used medically\nprescribed cannabis oil in 2017 on 10 to 15 occasions. (GEs 2-3) There is no evidence in\nthe record to indicate he used marijuana on any other occasions.\nE-QIP omissions\nAsked to complete an e-QIP in October 2017, Applicant falsified the form by\nomitting his termination from his employment with Company A in May 2015. (GE 1) In\nanswering questions posed in section 13A of his 2017 e-QIP, Applicant answered \u201cLeft\nby mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct\u201d and explained the\nmisconduct charges to mean engaging in a personal relationship resulting in a conflict of\ninterest. (GE 1) At no point in the e-QIP Applicant completed in 2017 did he\nacknowledge his being fired or terminated from Company A in May 2015 as the result in\nhis engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a coworker. (GEs 1 and 3 and AE A;\nTr. 30-33)\nIn the same October 2017 e-QIP, Applicant omitted his prior drug use in October\n2010 and again in December 2013, when responding to questions posed in section 23\nabout illegal use of drugs or controlled substances. (GE 1) Asked about past use of\nillegal drugs, Applicant disclosed his being examined by a medical provider for help with\nhis sleep and being furnished a medical marijuana card, which he used to purchase\nmarijuana around 10-15 times in August 2017. (GE 1) He provided no further information\nabout his past marijuana use in 2010 and 2013, either in section 23 or in the additional\ncomment section of the e-QIP. (GE 1)\n3\n\nIn a follow-up PSI conducted by an investigator from OPM in November 2017,\nApplicant failed again to disclose both his firing due to his having an inappropriate\nrelationship with another employee and his past use of marijuana in October 2010 and\nDecember 2013. (GE 2) In his PSI, he acknowledged only that he told the OPM\ninvestigator that he (a) resigned in lieu of being fired and (b) he used prescribed\nmarijuana in 2017 as a sleep aid on 10 to 15 occasions. (GE 2; Tr. 32-33, 40) \nNowhere in Applicant\u2019s 2017 OPM interview did he disclose his being fired from\nCompany A due to his having a personal relationship with another employee without\nreporting it to his human resources department or manager, or that he used marijuana in\n2010 and 2013. (GE 3 and AE A) Basically, he stuck to the same story he furnished in\nhis earlier 2017 e-QIP. (GEs 1-2)\nIn December 2017, Applicant completed a counterintelligence security screening\nquestionnaire. (GE 2) In this questionnaire, Applicant admitted his firing from a previous\nemployer for having an inappropriate relationship with another employee. \nUnder questioning by the screening investigator, Applicant admitted to not\ndisclosing in his e-QIP his being fired from Company A for engaging in an inappropriate\nrelationship with a coworker, in violation of company policy. (GE 2 and AE A) Applicant\nattributed his disclosure failures to his believing that leaving his Company A employment\nby mutual agreement sounded better than being fired. (GE 2 and AE A; Tr. 41-42). \nStill, Applicant\u2019s explanations for his omissions of his being fired instead of leaving\nby mutual agreement and his understating his marijuana use, both individually and\ncollectively, reflect a lack of candor. His explanations, while they reflected his reasoning\nat the time behind his employment termination omissions, document and confirm his\nknowing and wilful omissions of material information needed to develop background\ninformation pertinent to a determination of his eligibility to hold a security clearance. \nOn the strength of the evidence developed in the record, inferences are warranted\nthat Applicant\u2019s omissions and understatements about the circumstances of his\ndeparture from Company A and the extent of his past marijuana use in 2010 and 2013\nwhen completing his 2017 e-QIP were both knowing and wilful, and were left uncorrected\nin his ensuing PSI. Considering all of the circumstances surrounding his omissions and\nunderstatements, inferences are warranted of a material lack of candor by Appellant in\nhis omitting and misstating the circumstances surrounding his Company A termination\nand the dates of his use of marijuana in 2010 and 2013 when completing his 2017 e-\nQIP. \nAdverse inferences are warranted as well in connection with his failure to provide\nfull and accurate accounts of his Company A termination and more extensive marijuana\nuse when responding to OPM investigator questions in his ensuing PSI. Appellant\u2019s\ncorrected admissions of his termination from Company A and more extensive use of\nmarijuana were not provided until questioned by an investigator assigned to interview\nhim in a subsequent counterintelligence screening questionnaire.                                       \n                                                               \n4\n\nEndorsements \nApplicant did not provide any personal endorsements from his supervisors and\ncoworkers. Nor did he provide any performance evaluations, character references, nor\nevidence of community contributions.\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns. These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. \nThe guidelines do not require administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on\nthe enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\ndecision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in\naccordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be\nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should\n5\n\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 531 (1988).  And because all security clearances must be clearly consistent with the\nnational interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the Applicant.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or\nsensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process. . . AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  Because all security clearances must be clearly consistent\nwith the national interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the Applicant.\n6\n\nAnalysis\nApplicant presents as an IT consultant for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance. Principal security issues in this case center on Applicant\u2019s material\nomissions of his termination for cause by his Company A employer and his\nunderstating of the dates and extent of his marijuana use.\nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness under Guideline E as the result of his omissions of his  termination for\ncause by his Company A employer and his understating of the dates and extent of his\nmarijuana use in the e-QIP he completed in October 2017. Questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, are\neach core policy concerns of the personal conduct guideline (AG \u00b6 15) \nSection 1001 of Title 18 is a specific intent crime and perforce requires a\nshowing of subjective intent to deceive the Government. See United States v. Puente,\n982 F.2d 156, 159 (5  Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 2934 (1993); United States v.\nth\nSweig, 441 F.2d 1043, 1046-1047 (9  Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 847 (1970); United\nth\nStates v. Bussey, 942 F.2d 1241, 1250 (8  Cir. 1991). Probing for indices of knowing\nth\nand wilful deceit involves considerations of motive and all the surrounding\ncircumstances, recognizing how difficult it is to climb into the mind of the actor.\nIn Applicant\u2019s case, judgment and trustworthiness concerns are directly tied to\nApplicant\u2019s employment and marijuana omissions and understatements he furnished in\nhis e-QIP of October 2017, and which he failed to correct in his ensuing OPM\ninterview. Because his omissions are material to the Government\u2019s ability to fully\ninvestigate Applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a security clearance, they raise important\ntrustworthiness, reliability, and judgment concerns under Guideline E.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 06-20964, at 6 (April 10, 2008).  \nApplicant\u2019s termination for cause stemming from his having an inappropriate\nrelationship with another employee, in violation of his company\u2019s policy, and\nunderstatement of the dates and extent of his past marijuana use invite application of\nDC \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information; or\nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, or competent medical or mental health professional\ninvolved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility\ndetermination, or other official government representative,\u201d  and 16(d)(3), \u201ca pattern of\ndishonesty or rule violations.\u201d Each of these disqualifying conditions fully applies to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.\nApplicant\u2019s proven intentional omissions of his Company A termination and\nunderstatements of the dates and extent of his marijuana use and ensuing failures to\n7\n\nmake prompt, good-faith corrections when afforded opportunities to do so in his\nensuing OPM interview preclude the application of any of the other mitigating\nconditions potentially available to him under Guideline E. His belated responses to\nquestions posed to him in counterintelligence screening questionnaire about his\ntermination and use of marijuana cannot be considered either prompt nor made in\ngood-faith for mitigation purposes. \nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s omission of his\ntermination for cause and understatements of the dates and extent of his use  of\nmarijuana in his 2017 e-QIP, considerations of the evidence covering the\nGovernment\u2019s Guideline E allegations warrant unfavorable conclusions. Applicant\u2019s\nomissions and understatements reflect candor lapses incompatible with clearance\ncriteria. \nWhole-person assessment\nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has established insufficient \nprobative evidence of his overall honesty, trustworthiness, and understanding of DoD\npolicy constraints on providing inaccurate information material to making clearance\neligibility determination. At this time, Applicant is at continued risk of candor lapse\nrecurrences.  Evaluating all of the facts and circumstances developed in the record,\nApplicant fails to mitigate security concerns associated with the allegations covered by\nGuideline E.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\n      \nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):          AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas. 1.a -1.c:\n                     Against Applicant \n           \n      C   o nclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Savarino, Esq. \n______________ \n04/19/2019\nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct, \nGuideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 3, 2016. On \nAugust 24, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline J, criminal conduct, Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR with a detailed three-page answer, admitting \nall of the SOR allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.b. He provided explanations for each of the \nincidents that he admitted. The case was assigned to me on January 25, 2019. The \n\n \n2 \n \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for February 28, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. At the hearing, Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough J, which were admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received at \nDOHA on March 11, 2019. I left the record open until March 8, 2019, and Applicant \nprovided an additional character reference letter from a life-long friend, attesting to \nApplicant\u2019s honesty. (AE K) \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 58 years old. He graduated from high school in 1978 and obtained \nhis associate\u2019s degree in aeronautics in 1983. Applicant has been employed in the \naviation field in some capacity since age 12. (Tr. 42) He reports no military service. He \nmarried in 1990 and divorced in 1998 with no children. Applicant taught himself \ncomputer coding and he started software companies in the 1980s. (Tr. 45) His company \nemployed 85 people and had $45 million in annual sales when Applicant was age 29. \n(Tr. 48) Applicant moved south to a different state in 2016 to get away from a gritty and \ndeleterious lifestyle and start a job with a major federal contractor. (Tr. 91) \n \n Applicant admits he was arrested in February 2008 and charged with \npossession of a controlled substance, and driving while impaired. (Answer) Applicant \ntestified that he sustained a devastating leg injury in 2003 and he was unable to work \nthrough 2008. (Tr. 51, 53, 56, AE E, H) He had invested his life savings in his small \nbusiness. Since he had no insurance, he lost everything. (Answer) He was attempting to \nrebuild his business and facilitate investors, when he went out with an associate who \nused drugs. (Tr. 57-58) They had a beer together and then the associate drove them to \na house party where the associate and others used cocaine. Applicant testified credibly \nhe did not use cocaine that evening; although he did use it previously following his \ninjury. (Tr. 67)  He wanted to leave the party. (Tr. 58)  His associate said \u201ctake my keys\u201d \nand Applicant drove away. He was stopped by police and admitted to having a beer. \nThe vehicle owner\u2019s girlfriend left her coat in the back seat. When Applicant authorized \na search of the vehicle, police found cocaine and drug paraphernalia in the coat. He \nwas arrested. He no longer associates with the vehicle owner or the coat owner.  \n \nAlthough the driving while impaired charge was dismissed, Applicant was \nconvicted of possession of a controlled substance (found in the female\u2019s coat) and \nsentenced to three years\u2019 probation, court costs, and a fine. (Tr. 64-66) In section 22 \n(Police Record) of his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) or security \nclearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that he served four months in jail in \nJuly 2011 for a probation violation. He testified credibly that he was at the end of his \ncourt-ordered probation for the July 2008 conviction above, when he informed his \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s May 3, 2016 Security \nClearance Application (SCA) (Item 1), or his personal subject interview (PSI) on October 4, 2017. (Item 2)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprobation officer that he needed to travel to an upstate location. (Tr. 69) She responded \nthat he should just check in with her when he returned. (Tr. 71) When Applicant spent \nmore time upstate than he intended, he realized he was going to be late returning. (Tr. \n72) He called to advise the probation officer of this delay. She nonetheless reported the \ntardiness violation by Applicant, causing him to have to serve out his sentence in jail. \n(Tr. 73-74) His mother died while he was in jail. (Tr. 77)  \n \nApplicant admits that he was stopped by police in July 2008 and charged with \nunlicensed operation of a vehicle, running a red light, and driving an unregistered \nvehicle. SOR \u00b6 1.b was amended at the outset of the hearing to reflect that he was \n\u201cstopped\u201d by police and not \u201carrested.\u201d (Tr. 11-12) Applicant admits to the allegation as \namended. He received a citation and failed to appear in court. He has paid all fees and \nfines associated with that traffic stop, and the warrant that issued (for failure to appear) \nhas been rescinded in September 2018. (Tr. 85, AE A, F) Applicant states that 2008 \nwas a bad year and he struggled with depression as a result of his crippling injury and \nloss of his business. (Tr. 15, 67) He later treated with a clinical master social worker in \n2016. (Tr. 91-92)  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was also arrested for driving while impaired \n(DWI) in March 1999. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) He admits to this offense twenty years ago, and he \npled guilty and paid all fines and court costs associated with it. (Tr. 53-55) He also \nadmits that he was arrested in April 2017 for DWI as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant \ntestified that he was very ill and suffering from bronchitis and allergies at the time. (Tr. \n98)  He was prescribed medication by his physician, and he took a steroid, antibiotic, \nand cough medicine, prior to the arrest. (Tr. 103, 124) He was pulled over by police who \nsaid Applicant had swerved erratically while driving to a convenience mart at 2:00 a.m. \nto get throat lozenges. (Tr. 102) Applicant testified he was having a coughing fit. When \nhe was pulled over, he was unsteady on his feet due to the devastating injury. (Tr. 102) \nHe took a breathalyzer that registered zero blood-alcohol content. (Tr. 104) He was \nfound guilty of failure to use due care while driving since he was operating under the \ninfluence of cough medicine. (Tr. 105, GE 4, AE D) Applicant paid a $1,500 dollar fine. \n(Tr. 107)  \n \n \nApplicant last used illegal drugs in 2008. (Tr. 114) He drinks only on rare \noccasions. (Tr. 116) Applicant presented testimony from his supervisor of the fleet \nballistic missile section of a federal contractor. (Tr. 30) He spoke to Applicant\u2019s superb \nwork ethic and character, and testified that Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and reliable. \n(Tr. 34-36) The witness wrote Applicant\u2019s excellent performance evaluation. (AE J) \nApplicant also provided a favorable character reference letter and a letter from his \nprevious attorney attesting to the fact that he resolved all outstanding traffic violations in \nstate A and all fines were paid in 2015. (AE C, G) Applicant admitted the cross-alleged \nviolations under Guidelines E and G, at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2 and 3, and provides the same \nexplanations as above.  \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                       Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful \nweighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n           The security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n31(a) a pattern of minor offenses; any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness;   \n \n31(b) evidence, (including but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n \n31(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-ordered rehabilitation program.   \n.  \n \nApplicant has admitted to his arrests for DWI in 1999 (convicted); possession of \na controlled substance found in a female\u2019s coat in 2008 (convicted); failure to exercise \ndue  care (reduced from DWI) in 2017 (for driving while coughing); a tardiness probation \nviolation, and a failure to appear in court as a result of his 2008 arrest. He also had a \nseries of traffic violations when he was down on his luck around 2008. His admissions \nare corroborated by the record evidence including the FBI criminal history and court \ndocuments introduced by Department Counsel. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (b), and (d) have been \nestablished by the Government\u2019s evidence. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n          Applicant has only one conviction for DWI that occurred over twenty years ago.  \nHis last arrest for failure to exercise due care (driving while coughing and taking cough \nmedicine) was not an alcohol-related event. He paid a $1,500 fine for this conviction. \nThe 2008 arrest for possession, and attendant traffic offenses, all occurred when \nApplicant was suffering from depression as the result of loss of his life savings in his \nsmall business, and loss of his health. Applicant was forthright and candid that his \nchoice of prospective business associates at that time showed a lack of judgment. \nHowever, I accept his testimony that the cocaine and paraphernalia found in the \nfemale\u2019s coat were not his. These offenses occurred 11 years ago, and he has since \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntreated with a master clinical social worker and turned his life around. While it is \ninexplicable why he failed to appear in court after the July 2008 traffic stop, it is clear \nthat he has since paid all associated costs, fines and fees to state A. Although his \nconduct in 2008 reflects a careless disregard for laws and rules of the road, Applicant \nconvinced me that it was a fleeting and uncharacteristic period in his life. He has \novercome a catastrophic injury, loss of his mother while in jail, and loss of a lucrative \nbusiness. It is not likely that his misconduct will recur and I am confident he will follow \nrules and regulations with respect to handling classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and \n(d) apply.   \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \n \n \nApplicant had only one alcohol-related incident, the DWI arrest in 1999. SOR AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 22(a) is applicable, even though the incident is very dated.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \nMy analyses above under Guideline J is the same under this administrative \nGuideline G, and are herein incorporated by reference. Applicant has never been \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndiagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. There is no evidence that he is alcohol \ndependent or abuses alcohol. He completed court-ordered probation and all conditions \nordered in 2008, although he had one hiccup when he violated his conditions by his \ntardiness in checking in with his probation officer in 2011. He voluntarily attended \ncounseling with a master clinical social worker in 2016. He only drinks on rare \noccasions, and never to excess. Applicant provided assurance that he has modified his \ndrinking and that he uses alcohol moderately. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (b) apply to mitigate the \ncross-alleged allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a.  \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a pattern of rules violations and traffic offenses that \nmay indicate an inability or unwillingness to modify his behavior and comply with laws \nand rules of the road for safe driving. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) is implicated.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns \ninclude: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nMy analyses above under Guidelines J and G are the same under this this \nGuideline E, and are herein incorporated by reference. Applicant has completed \ncounseling, moved away from his external stressors, and modified his lifestyle. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(c) and (d) apply. They are enough to overcome Applicant\u2019s established pattern of \nviolating the law and rules. Most of his illegal conduct and driving offenses occurred \nduring a period of enormous stress in Applicant\u2019s life and may be considered minor \nunder the circumstances. They do not present a pattern of bad judgment. Applicant has \nproduced documentation, witness testimony, and his own testimony, showing that he \nhas overcome any putative drinking problem and modified his consumption. He has not \nused drugs since 2008 and he has an engaging and rewarding career opportunity.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines. Most importantly, Applicant has addressed \nthe specific allegations in the SOR. He has overcome adversity and desires to serve the \ndefense industry as a contractor. He has offered sufficient evidence to assure the \nGovernment that there will be no recurrence. He has met his burden of production.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:              \nFor Applicant \n \n \n Paragraph 2, Guideline E:                      FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraph 2.a:                                  For Applicant \n \n            Paragraph 3, Guideline G:                       FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraph 3.a:                                   For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nApril 5, 2019. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted six SOR allegations and denied the remaining three. Her \nadmissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings \nand evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nthis contractor for approximately 14 years. She served honorably in the U.S. Army and \nretired in 1997 after 20 years in the grade of sergeant first class (E-7). She has held a \nsecurity clearance for over 40 years. She has a high school diploma and has taken \nsome college courses. She is currently married. She has been married four times \npreviously. She has two adult children.1 \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had a foreclosed mortgage account; a past-due \naccount in the amount of approximately $31,890; five charged-off or collection accounts \ntotaling approximately $4,269; and two delinquent medical accounts totaling $104. The \ndebts were listed in a credit report from January 2017. Credit reports from August 2018 \nand March 2019 show no delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.i).2 \nApplicant credibly explained that her financial problems occurred during the 2008 \nto 2011 timeframe when she was married to her fourth husband (H4). Applicant\u2019s job \nrequired frequent lengthy travel away from home. When she was away during her \nmarriage to H4, he told her he was paying the mortgage payment for their home, which \nat some point became rental property. They initially used a realtor to lease and manage \nthis property. H4 neglected to tell Applicant that he fired the realtor and began \nmanaging the rental property himself. He neglected to pay the mortgage payments on \nthe property and failed to supervise the tenants who severely damaged the property. \nEventually, the property went through foreclosure. Applicant was unaware the property \nwas in jeopardy until the foreclosure proceedings. The property had a second mortgage, \nwhich also became delinquent while H4 was managing the property. Neither mortgage \nholder has sought a deficiency judgment against Applicant since the foreclosure in \n2010. Applicant sought and was granted a divorce against H4 in 2011. There is no \nevidence showing that she had any financial difficulties before she married or after she \ndivorced H4. Applicant recently purchased a home and is current on her monthly \npayments.3 \n1 Tr. at 16-18, 21-22, 29; GE 1, 2. \n2 GE 3-5. \n3 Tr. at 18, 20-21, 23-26; GE 4-5. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \nApplicant documented that she paid the SOR debts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and \n1.f in July 2018. Those debts are resolved. She also documented her dispute of SOR \ndebts \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h by showing that she was covered by medical insurance and would \nnot have incurred those debts. As for SOR debt \u00b6 1.d, Applicant credibly stated that she \ncontacted the creditor and they could not find that she owed on a debt.  This is  \nconfirmed by the absence of any debt listing on the latest two credit reports. Those \ndebts are resolved.4 \nIn addition to her credit reports showing no delinquent debts and her recent \nhome purchase, Applicant also has a retirement account valued at approximately \n$100,000. This supports her testimony that she is in good financial standing.5 \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary  \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n4 Tr. at 18-19, 27-28; GE 4-5; AE A-B, D-E. \n5 Tr. at 29. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe evidence showed Applicant accrued several delinquent collection debts and \na mortgage foreclosure. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised.  \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAlthough Applicant should have responded in a more timely fashion, she has \nresolved her debts, outside of the mortgage foreclosure. The foreclosure was somewhat \nbeyond her control because H4 had assumed responsibility for overseeing the property \nwhile she was working remotely. He failed in this responsibility and she suffered the \nconsequences. However, these debts no longer appear on her credit report. She \nsuccessfully disputed the two medical debts by showing her insurance entitlement. The \nremaining debt was not found by the creditor. There are clear indications that her \nfinancial issues are resolved and that recurrence is unlikely. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) \u2013 \n20(e) are applicable. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, her federal contractor service, and the \ncircumstances surrounding her indebtedness. I am convinced that Applicant will not \nincur delinquent debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 58-year-old man who has been married for 23 years. He was married previously from 1983 to 1986. The marriage ended in divorce. For the past three years, he has been working for a telecommunications company, as a network systems manager. (Tr. 13) Between January and February of 2015, Applicant used his personal e-mail account, which he accessed through his work computer, to solicit sexual acts via Craigslist. On one occasion, Applicant attached to his solicitation an electronically-transmitted photo of himself that he described as sexually explicit. In May 2015, Applicant\u2019s employer discovered these illicit online communications. Shortly thereafter, he was terminated. Applicant completed a security clearance application in October 2015, when he applied for his current job. He admitted that he was terminated, but stated that he was terminated for buying and selling things on eBay and Craigslist while at work, rather than for soliciting sex online while at work. Applicant characterized himself as \u201ca stupid person at the time\u201d he misused the work computer, and testified that such behavior will never recur. (Tr. 27) He characterized his relationship with his wife as an open one, in which they have both had affairs over the years.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s use of his work computer to solicit sex, and his subsequent failure to \ndisclose this episode on his security clearance application as the reason for his subsequent \nemployment termination, generate personal conduct security concerns that he failed to \nmitigate. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 22, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, explaining why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive) and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June \n8, 2017. \n04/11/2019\n\n2 \n \nOn September 17, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations and \nrequesting a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019. On \nFebruary 11, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, \nscheduling Applicant\u2019s case for March 14, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. I \nreceived two Government exhibits (GE 1 and GE 2) and considered Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nI also incorporated a copy of the discovery letter that Department Counsel mailed to \nApplicant (Hearing Exhibit I). The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 26, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old man who has been married for 23 years. He was married \npreviously from 1983 to 1986. The marriage ended in divorce. For the past three years, he \nhas been working for a telecommunications company, as a network systems manager. (Tr. \n13) \n \n \nBetween January and February of 2015, Applicant used his personal e-mail \naccount, which he accessed through his work computer, to solicit sexual acts via Craigslist. \nOn one occasion, Applicant attached to his solicitation an electronically-transmitted photo \nof himself that he described as sexually explicit. In May 2015, Applicant\u2019s employer \ndiscovered these illicit online communications. Shortly thereafter, he was terminated. \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in October 2015, when he \napplied for his current job. He admitted that he was terminated, but stated that he was \nterminated for buying and selling things on eBay and Craigslist while at work, rather than \nfor soliciting sex online while at work. \n \n \nApplicant characterized himself as \u201ca stupid person at the time\u201d he misused the work \ncomputer, and testified that such behavior will never recur. (Tr. 27) He characterized his \nrelationship with his wife as an open one, in which they have both had affairs over the \nyears. He testified that his wife is aware that he occasionally uses the internet to arrange \nsexual encounters with others. (Tr. 21) She neither testified, nor provided an affidavit. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \n\n3 \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n4 \n \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s misuse of his work computer triggers the application of \nAG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, \nor duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group.\u201d His subsequent \nfalsification of his e-QIP triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of his work computer occurred four years ago. However, he \nprovided no evidence of anything that he has done to prevent a recurrence. Moreover, his \ntestimony that his wife knows about his online sexual solicitations has little probative value \nabsent her testimony. Lastly, Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose this episode as the cause of his \njob termination, when he completed his 2015 e-QIP, clearly demonstrates that he remains \nvulnerable to coercion. Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the relevant disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

Young, Esq., Applicant\u2019s Counsel \n \n \nDecember 9, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 17, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines M, Use of Information \nTechnology, and E, Personal Conduct. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based \non information available to the government, DoD adjudicators could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 22, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was originally assigned to another \njudge, but was reassigned to me on July 31, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 24, 2019, scheduling the hearing for \nAugust 6, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on \n\n \n2 \n \nhis own behalf and presented 16 documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AppXs) A through P, which were also admitted without objection. \n \nOn direct examination, Applicant also testified as to his past alcohol \nconsumption. (Transcript (TR) at page 21 line 8 to page 26 line 23.) As a result, \nDepartment Counsel amended the SOR adding Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption. (TR \nat page 58 line 11 to page 59 line 7.) After the record was closed on August 6, 2019, \nDepartment Counsel issued the written amendment to the SOR, adding subparagraphs \n3.a.~3.f. The record had been left open for 15 days from the date of the receipt of that \namendment for Applicant to ask for the record to be reopened, to formally answer the \namended SOR, to submit additional documentation, and/or to submit a closing \nstatement. (Id.) On August 22, 2019, Applicant answered the amended SOR (Answer2), \nand submitted a closing statement. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on \nAugust 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 5.) \nHe has been employed with the defense contractor since November of 2016. (GX 1 at \npage 15.) As a result of the incident alleged in subparagraph 1.a., Applicant \u201cwas \ndenied access to classified information,\u201d but it was re-granted in conjunction with his \ncurrent duty position. (GX 1 at pages 91~92.). He is divorced, and has no children. (TR \nat page 12 line 21 to page 15 line 14.) \n \n \nGuideline M - Use of Information Technology & Guideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \n1.a. and 2.a  Applicant, while a member of the U.S. Air Force, intentionally \nmisused his administrative rights access to a U.S. Government administrative computer \naccount to log into his then wife\u2019s personal storage files, on two to three occasions, from \nabout December of 2015 to February of 2016. He suspected that she was engaging in \non-line infidelity. (TR at page 36 line 2 to page 42 line 12, and at page 52 line 12 to \npage 55 line 7, and AppX K.) Applicant self-reported this error in judgment. (Id.) This, \ncoupled with an October 2, 2015, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) incident, \nwhich will be discussed under Paragraph 3, below, resulted in Applicant being \nseparated from the Air Force. (TR at page 17 line 12 to page 21 line 7.) His former \nspouse, a member of the U.S. Air Force, supports Applicant\u2019s security clearance \nretention request. (AppX O.) \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n \n  \n3.a. Applicant admits that he was cited in 1999 for possession of alcohol by a \nminor. (Answer2 at page 1.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n3.b. Applicant admits that in August of 2005, he was charged with a DUI. The \ncharges were later dismissed in accordance with a plea bargain, which included \nApplicant\u2019s agreement to join the U.S. Air Force and graduate from basic training \nwithout further incident. (Answer2 at page 1.) \n \n \n3.c., 3.d., 3.e. and 3.f. As noted above, in October of 2015, Applicant received \nnon-judicial punishment for a second DUI. (TR at page 21 line 8 to page 26 line 20, and \nGX 3.) As a result, Applicant attended 3~5 mandatory out-patient Alcohol and Drug \nAbuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) counseling/treatment sessions from October \nto November of 2015. However, as the result of a relapse in December of 2015, \nApplicant self-referred himself back to ADAPT, where he was diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser. He completed this counseling in July of 2016. Applicant last consumed alcohol \nto the point of intoxication in June of 2019, about two months prior to his hearing. (TR at \npage 25 lines 21~25.)   \n \n \nApplicant is well respected in the work place as evidenced by seven character \nreferences. (AppX A.) \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline M - Use of Information Technology \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information Technology \nis set out in AG \u00b6 39:  \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 40. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; \nand \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \n \n \nApplicant misused his access rights on his Government computer to log into his \nformer spouse\u2019s personal storage files. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of his access occurred under unusual circumstances, more \nthan three years ago. Despite the misuse of his computer administrative rights vis-\u00e0-vis \nhis former spouse; he has the support of his former spouse, and the support of those \nwith whom he works. This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n\n \n6 \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of his computer access arguably shows a pattern of rule \nviolations. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nAgain, Applicant\u2019s error in judgement occurred under unusual circumstances, \nmore than three years ago. He has the support of his former spouse, and of those with \nwhom he works. This allegation is also found for Applicant.  \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions may apply: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant had three alcohol-related incidents between 1999 and 2015, to include \ntwo DUIs. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nI find that none of these apply. Applicant had a relapse in December of 2015, and \nhas been diagnosed as an alcohol abuser. Despite this diagnosis; only two months prior \nto his hearing, Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication. This allegation is \nfound against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n8 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines M, K, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working in the defense industry and is respected \nby those with whom he works. He performs well at his job.  \n \nOverall, however, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Alcohol Consumption security concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a.~3.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Her financial difficulties are due to circumstances \nlargely beyond her control (e.g., serious health problems, a separation eventually \nresulting in a divorce, unemployment, and underemployment). She has acted \nresponsibly under trying circumstances and will address the unresolved delinquent \ndebts as her financial situation continues to stabilize. Accordingly, this case is decided \nfor Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \n1 Applicant resumed using her former name per a June 2018 divorce decree. \n03/29/2019\n\n \n2 \n \non November 14, 2017.2 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on July 24, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 21, 2018. Her answers were mixed; she \nadmitted 6 of the 12 delinquent debts alleged; she denied the others; and she provided \nshort explanations for each answer. She also requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place \nas scheduled on December 3, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-5. Applicant \nmade an oral presentation, but presented no documentation. No witnesses were called \nother than Applicant.  \n \nThe record was kept open until January 3, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit \ndocumentary matters. She made a timely submission on January 2, 2019, and those \nmatters are admitted without objections as follows: (1) Exhibit A, military records and \nletters of recommendation; (2) Exhibit B, a June 2018 divorce decree; and (3) Exhibit C,  \na December 2018 establishment judgment and order for child support.   \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in the defense industry for the first time. She previously held a security \nclearance during previous military service. She is employed as a gunner involved in \nordnance testing since December 2017. Her formal education includes a high school \ndiploma. She married in 2008, separated in May 2017, and divorced in June 2018. She \nis the primary residential parent for two minor children, ages 10 and 5.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes honorable service in the U.S. Navy \nduring 2006-2012, for about five and a half years. She was discharged due to disability \nas explained further below. Her retired pay, which she receives from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, is about $1,600 monthly.3 She was then unemployed from about \nJanuary 2012 to May 2017, when she left her husband. She then worked as a self-\nemployed office assistant working for her parents for about six months until she began \nher current job in the defense industry. She earned about $400 weekly working for her \nparents. \n                                                          \n2 Exhibit 1. \n \n3 Tr. 44-45.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts consisting of charged-off or collection \naccounts for a total of about $18,000. Three of the accounts are medical collection \naccounts for less than $100 each. At the hearing, Applicant agreed that the status of the \ndebts remained the same as when she answered the SOR.4 In addition to Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions noted above, the 12 delinquent debts are established by three credit reports \nfrom January 2018, September 2018, and December 2018, respectively.5 So far as I \ncan determine, the 12 delinquent debts in the SOR have not been paid, settled, placed \ninto a repayment arrangement, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved.  \n \nApplicant attributes her negative financial history to circumstances largely \nbeyond her control. She described at length the chronology of events leading to her \ncurrent situation during her hearing testimony.  She was discharged from the Navy in \n2012 due to numerous medical problems, primarily cervical cancer. Her discharge \npaperwork states that the reason for separation was temporary disability, and she was \nplaced on the temporary disability retired list, and subsequently she was placed on the \npermanent disability retired list in 2015.6 After her discharge from the Navy in 2012, she \nspent the next five years dealing with illness, in and out of the hospital, and undergoing \ndifferent procedures. Her inability to work during that time placed a financial strain on \nthe family finances. Her husband, also a Sailor, continued on active duty for about two \nyears. After his discharge in 2014, they relocated to a state to be close to her husband\u2019s \nfamily. The plan was her husband was supposed to begin a railroad job within two \nmonths of his discharge, but that was delayed for several months, which created \nadditional financial strain. They then started the slow process of rebuilding their financial \nhouse.  \n \nApplicant had a serious medical episode in which she nearly passed away in \nAugust 2016. After that, her health improved, she returned to being a functioning adult, \nand she started looking into returning to work or going to school through her GI Bill \nbenefits. Her husband was opposed to her plans, and marital discord followed. \nUnsatisfied with her husband, she left in May 2017 and moved across the country to live \nwith and work for her parents. When she left her husband, she departed with her \nclothing, her children\u2019s clothing, a vehicle, her retired pay, and really nothing else. She \nfiled for child support in July 2017 and for divorce in September 2017, but was unable to \nobtain service of process on her husband. That changed when her husband relocated to \nApplicant\u2019s state of residence for his employment in April 2018. \n \nTwo months later in June 2018 the state court granted a divorce decree, but \ndeferred on the issue of child support.7 Applicant was designated as the primary \nresidential parent. The issue of child support was finally settled in December 2018, a \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 41-42.  \n \n5 Exhibits 3, 4, and 5.  \n \n6 Exhibit A.  \n \n7 Exhibit B.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nfew days after the hearing in this case.8 Her ex-husband was ordered to pay a judgment \nin the amount of $3,180 for child support for the period from May 2017 through \nDecember 2018. He was also ordered to pay current child support of $484 monthly \nbeginning January 2019. The total monthly payment to Applicant is $534 monthly, which \nincludes $50 toward the arrearage or judgment.  \n \nSince beginning her job in the defense industry, Applicant was able to move out \nof her parents\u2019 home and purchase a relatively new vehicle (a 2017 Hyundai), which \nwas necessary to cover the mileage she must drive. She has not incurred new \ndelinquent debt other than the automobile and the purchase of a washer and dryer. In \naddition to her retired pay and the child support, she earns about $22 hourly and \nestimated her 2018 earnings at about $45,000.9   \n  \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.10 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.11 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d12 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.13 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.14 \n \n                                                          \n8 Exhibit C.  \n \n9 Tr. 64-65.  \n \n10 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n11 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n12 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n13 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n14 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.15 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.16 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.17 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.18 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.19 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.20 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .21 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n                                                          \n15 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n16 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n17 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n18 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n19 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n20 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n21 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n AG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The two \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nConcerning the evidence in extenuation and mitigation, Applicant receives \nmaximum credit under AG \u00b6 20(b). Her financial difficulties are due to circumstances \nlargely beyond her control as follows: (1) serious health problems resulting in her \ndischarge from the Navy due to disability; (2) continuation of her health problems \nresulting in her inability to work for the next five years; (3) her husband\u2019s period of \nunemployment after his discharge from the Navy; (4) her marital separation and divorce; \n(5) her period of underemployment before her current job; and (6) delay in \nestablishment of a child-support order, which just commenced in January 2019. Plainly, \nthese are circumstances largely beyond her control.  \n \n \nMoreover, I am persuaded that she acted like a reasonable person who was \nconfronting a difficult situation. She left her husband who was unsupportive of her and \nthen took a low-level job working for her parents while she sought out and found a \nbetter job. She also promptly pursued both child support and a divorce, but was delayed \ndue to her husband\u2019s location in a distant state. Although she recently bought a car, a \nrelatively new 2017 Hyundai can only be described as basic transportation and \nreasonable. With her current employment, retired pay, and the addition of monthly child \nsupport, Applicant is now in a position to do something about the delinquent debts, and I \nam persuaded that she will do so in due course.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

(Tr. \n46) Applicant refused a breathalyzer test. (Tr. 46) He received nonjudicial punishment \nunder Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice, and a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions because of misconduct.

(Tr. 46) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges in November 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nDisorderly Conduct-Brawling/Fighting-Domestic Violence. Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.b; \nhowever, he said the case never went to court because the charges were dismissed. (Tr. \n                                            \n1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific information is available \nin the cited exhibits. \n \n2 Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant\u2019s \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA).

(GE 1) Applicant drank five or six rum and cokes at \na bar. (Tr. 87; GE 3) The police stopped Applicant because of a traffic violation. (Tr. 50) \nHe kept burping, and the police were unable to conduct a breathalyzer. (Tr. 50) The police \ndid not complete the breathalyzer test or attempt to conduct a blood-alcohol test.

(Tr. 88) He successfully completed the \ndiversion plan, and the charge was dismissed with prejudice. (Tr. 52; GE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges in August 2012, Applicant was charged with Disorderly Conduct \nand Criminal Trespass. (GE 1) Applicant said he drank about two drinks at a party; \nhowever, he told the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he drank \nfive or six drinks and that he was intoxicated. (Tr. 55, 90; GE 3) He left the party, and he \nfollowed a 16-year-old girl to her apartment which was located in the same building as \nthe party. (Tr. 53, 90-91) At the time, he said he thought the girl he was following was an \nadult. (Tr. 109) She told him he could not come inside her apartment, and he went to the \nparking lot where his vehicle was located. (GE 3) He left the parking lot and he returned \nto her apartment because he said he needed to obtain directions. (Tr. 54) She told him to \nleave; they argued; and her father evidently called the police. (Tr. 92, 110, 115; GE 3) \nThe owner of the apartment where the party occurred was cited for serving alcohol to \nminors. (Tr. 110) Applicant conceded that alcohol played a part in his decisions because \nif he had not been drinking he would not have needed directions. (Tr. 55-56, 92) He \npleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. (GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges in June 2013, Applicant was charged with DUI. (GE 1) The \npolice stopped Applicant for a traffic violation. (Tr. 56-57) His blood-alcohol test (BAT) \nresult was .187. (Tr. 57) Applicant believed he could drive, and he did not think he was \n\u201cimpaired\u201d even though his BAT was .187. (Tr. 57, 93-94) Applicant was found guilty of \nDUI, and he was on probation for one year. (Tr. 94; GE 1; GE 3) He received a $1,000 \nfine, and he was required to remain sober during his probation. (Tr. 94; GE 1) After \ncompleting probation, he reduced the number of occasions in which he drove after \ndrinking alcohol. (Tr. 58, 95) He limited his alcohol consumption to one beer when he is \ngoing to drive. (Tr. 58) SOR \u00b6 2.a cross alleges the information in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.d as criminal conduct. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges in September 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nDomestic Battery-Knowing/Reckless Bodily Harm. (GE 1) The assault involved \nApplicant\u2019s first wife. (Tr. 30-32) Applicant had about two drinks of an alcohol beverage. \n(Tr. 72, 95) He was angry, and he pushed and kicked a door, which struck his spouse\u2019s \nhand. (Tr. 67-68) He claimed he did not see her when he hit her with the door. (Tr. 69) \nShe also claimed he threw keys at her and hit her; however, he denied that the keys hit \nher. (Tr. 72-74) He threatened to sell the house. (Tr. 74) The part of the OPM summary \nof interview and the police report indicating he threatened to kill everyone in his home are \nincorrect. (Tr. 75, 96-97; GE 3) The police arrested him, and he was issued a 72-hour \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nrestraining order. (Tr. 69; GE 3) His spouse wanted Applicant to come home, and the \nprosecutor dismissed the charges. (Tr. 70, 76; GE 1) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current spouse met his first spouse on one occasion at a wedding, and \nhis current spouse described his first spouse as aggressive and violent. (Tr. 30-32) His \ncurrent spouse observed his first spouse as she assaulted Applicant at a wedding, and \nhis first wife was so out of control that it was \u201clike you see in the cartoons.\u201d (Tr. 30-31) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges in July 2017, Applicant was charged with Domestic Battery-\nBodily Harm. Applicant had gone out drinking. (Tr. 97; GE 2) His current spouse took his \nwallet and his identification cards and credit cards. (Tr. 98-99) She threw his wallet \noutside, and she locked him out of the house. (Tr. 98; GE 3) She subsequently returned \nhis identification and credit cards to him. (Tr. 99) A day or so later, Applicant and his \nspouse were involved in a physical altercation. He said she was the aggressor, and he \nwas only attempting to keep her from driving his truck. (Tr. 77) His spouse hit him, and \nher ring cut his face. (Tr. 78)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s description of the July 2017 altercation with Applicant was \nconsistent with Applicant\u2019s description. Applicant\u2019s spouse said that she and Applicant \nargued about his alcohol consumption several days before he was arrested for assault. \n(Tr. 37) She took his wallet. (Tr. 37) She was anxious about when he would come home \nafter work. (Tr. 38-39) She said she was \u201cyelling and screaming and lying and saying he\u2019s \nhurting me.\u201d (Tr. 18) She said they had a \u201cscuffle\u201d because he took her car keys and \npassport and because she had taken pain medication and consumed alcohol. (Tr. 18) \nHer purse was in his vehicle, and it contained her passport and car keys. (Tr. 20) She \nattributed the altercation to her use of alcohol together with \u201cProzac and really high doses \nof steroids.\u201d (Tr. 19) She felt angry and aggressive, and she hit him. (Tr. 19-20) He was \nnot aggressive; however, the videotape showed him not letting her in his truck and pulling \nher away from his truck. (Tr. 20) She believed the police arrested Applicant because he \nis a large person; he was yelling; and a witness made a statement against him. (Tr. 21-\n22) He did not punch her; however, she had \u201csome scrapes and things.\u201d (Tr. 22) She said \nshe lied to the police about the abuse because she was angry, and the drugs were \naffecting her judgment. (Tr. 22)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse asked the prosecutors not to charge Applicant, nevertheless, \nthey prosecuted him. (Tr. 23) He pleaded guilty; and he received a \u201cdeferred judgment\u201d \nprobation agreement. (GE 2; AE A) He received fines and court costs totaling $482. (GE \n2) His probation specified that he was not supposed to consume alcohol from February \n2018 to February 2019. (Tr. 102-103; GE 2 (stating that he would \u201c[u]se no alcohol\u201d) He \nsaid he had a single relapse; however, he did not report it to his probation officer because \nhe did not consider it to be relevant. (Tr. 103)3 His probation officer did not specifically \nask him whether he consumed alcohol. (Tr. 105) He conceded violating probation was \npertinent, but he did not consider it to be crucial. (Tr. 103-104) He received a deferred \n                                            \n3 Applicant\u2019s August 4, 2018 SOR response indicates he has \u201ccomplied and continues to comply \nwith his probation\u201d requirements. (SOR response at 4, 6) His SOR response indicates that he \u201cno longer \ndrives while under the influence\u201d of alcohol. (SOR response at 3)       \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nsentence, and he remained on probation until February 2019. (Tr. 79) On February 28, \n2019, the domestic violence offense was dismissed with prejudice. (AE A)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges on November 28, 2017, Applicant stated at an OPM interview \nthat he drank alcohol every day, and he drank alcohol to intoxication every other week. \n(GE 3) Applicant admitted that he drank three or four beers almost every day, and every \nother weekend he drank seven or eight beers. (Tr. 59-60; GE 3) In the past five years, \nApplicant drank enough alcohol to have blackouts once or twice. (Tr. 115) Applicant\u2019s \nspouse said he reduced his alcohol consumption in 2017. (Tr. 16)  \n \nOn March 30, 2018, Applicant received an alcohol use assessment.4 It did not \nrecommend counseling or treatment. (Tr. 105) He reported his arrests in 2006, 2011, \n2013, and 2017 to security. He said he drank two to six drinks twice a week. He completed \nalcohol treatment or counseling in 2006 and 2013.  \n \nApplicant said he attends counseling once a week or more often as needed, \nmeditation, and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as needed. (Tr. 63, 82) He most \nrecently attended an AA meeting three weeks before his hearing. (Tr. 113-114) He said \nhe attends AA meetings once or twice a month; however, he did not attend enough AA \nmeetings to receive any AA coins. (Tr. 114) In May 2018, he completed a class on \ndomestic violence. \n \nMore recently, Applicant used Uber or public transportation in lieu of driving himself \nafter he consumes alcohol. (Tr. 26-27) Applicant said he decided to quit consuming \nalcohol in 2017, and he actually stopped drinking \u201c[a]bout that time.\u201d (Tr. 101, 116-117) \nHe subsequently had a couple of relapses. (Tr. 101, 106, 117-118) He said the last time \nhe consumed alcohol was in August 2018. (Tr. 102, 106, 118)5 His spouse also stopped \nconsuming alcohol, and they do not have alcohol in their home. (Tr. 17) They do not go \nto bars. (Tr. 25) Applicant does not intend to drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 111) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nIn the winter of 2017, Applicant\u2019s spouse had major surgery. (Tr. 18) After she \nmarried Applicant, she had a stroke, transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, an embolism, \nbroken bones from a fall, a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, \nand blood clots. (Tr. 27-28) She spent 41 days in intensive care. (Tr. 28) She was \nbedridden for a time. (Tr. 28) She said the post-surgery drugs affected her memory. (Tr. \n18) Applicant has been very supportive of her. (Tr. 18-28) He attended marriage \ncounseling and classes. (Tr. 23) She supported approval of his security clearance. (Tr. \n36, 43-44) \n                                            \n4 Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this paragraph is an alcohol assessment \non March 30, 2018. (SOR response) \n \n5 Applicant\u2019s spouse did not pay attention to the amount of beer he drank. (Tr. 41) She did not \nnotice when he stopped drinking alcohol for several weeks. (Tr. 42) She was unable to say whether he \nstopped drinking alcohol in 2017, 2018, or 2019. (Tr. 43)  \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 and 2018 performance reviews indicate he exceeds expectations \nor meets expectations for all categories. (AE B; SOR response) The general sense of the \nstatements of six of Applicant\u2019s coworkers, a family support worker, and friends is that he \nis diligent, reliable, peaceful, dedicated, intelligent, professional, and compliant with \nprocedural requirements. (AE C; SOR response) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \napplicant\u2019s personal or professional history that may disqualify the applicant for eligibility \nfor access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, \n1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions under the alcohol consumption guideline that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying including: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. 6  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) apply. Applicant\u2019s SOR in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d allege and the \nrecord establishes four alcohol-related incidents involving the police, courts, or his \ncommand from 1990 to 2013. His BACs for three of the four alcohol-related incidents are \nunknown. His BAC for the June 2013 DUI was .187, and it establishes that he engaged \nin binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment.7  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \n                                            \n6 Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege: (1) his domestic battery in 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.c) as being alcohol-\nrelated; (2) his violation of probation by consuming alcohol; and (3) his alcohol-related blackout in the \nprevious five years. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-\n00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). These \nthree non-SOR alcohol-related concerns will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \n \n7 \u201cBinge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the United States.\u201d See \nthe Center for Disease Control website, (stating \u201cThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \ndefines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to \n0.08 grams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when \nwomen consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.\u201d), https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-\ndrinking.htm. There are other definitions of \u201cbinge alcohol consumption\u201d that involve different alcohol-\nconsumption amounts and patterns. \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly \nlengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at \n3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); \nISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007). See also ISCR Case No. 08-\n04232 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2009) (affirming denial of security clearance for Applicant with \nalcohol-related criminal offenses for six years prior to hearing). For example, in ISCR \nCase No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board reversed the \nadministrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB \nhad several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in 2000, \nsix years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol \nconsumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and \ncapricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving \ncase with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and reversing \nadministrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \nIn the last five years, Appellant drank sufficient alcohol to have a blackout. Alcohol-\nrelated blackouts are a consequence of binge-alcohol consumption. During an alcohol-\nrelated blackout, a person: \n \nis still fully conscious. They\u2019re moving around, acting, engaging, talking, \ndancing, driving, engaging in all kinds of behavior, but because of alcohol\u2019s \ninhibition of the transfer of information from short-term memory to long-term \nmemory, they simply will be unable to remember those decisions or actions \nthey made while in the blackout.8 \n \nA person who is in blacked-out state, may still \u201cengage in voluntary behavior and \nthought processes. \u2018They might make decisions, for example, to drive home from a bar, \nor [engage in other] . . . activities which require complex cognitive abilities, but the \n                                            \n8 In United States v. Pease, 74 M.J. 763, 769 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2015), an expert on the effects \nof alcohol intoxication, Dr. Kim Fromme,  Ph.D., described the levels of alcohol intoxication and the impact \non human behavior, cognitive abilities, and memory. See also United States v. Collins, No. 201000020, \n2011 CCA LEXIS 22 at *4-*8. (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2011) (unpub.) (testimony of prosecution toxicology \nexpert, Jon Jemiomek). \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nindividual might not remember the next day and might, in fact, might regret it.\u2019\u201d9 A person \nwho consumes alcohol to a blacked out state may not remember how much alcohol they \nconsumed, or they may violate national security and have no recollection of their conduct. \n \nApplicant presented evidence supporting mitigation of alcohol-consumption \nconcerns. Applicant said he attends alcohol-related counseling once a week or more often \nas needed, meditation, and AA meetings as needed. On March 30, 2018, Applicant \nreceived an alcohol use assessment. (SOR response) It did not recommend counseling \nor treatment. In his evaluation, he disclosed that he drank two to six drinks twice a week. \nHe completed alcohol treatment or counseling in 2006 and 2013. As of his March 30, \n2018 assessment, his most recent alcohol use was in December 2017.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant was involved in a \ntotal of five alcohol-related incidents from 1990 to 2015. His probation for his July 2017 \ndomestic battery specified that he was not permitted to consume alcohol from February \n2018 to February 2019. He said he had a single relapse; however, he did not report it to \nhis probation officer because he did not consider it to be relevant. He said the last time \nhe consumed alcohol was in August 2018, and he does not intend to drink alcohol in the \nfuture.   \n \nSix factors weigh against mitigation of alcohol consumption security concerns: (1) \nApplicant\u2019s five alcohol-related arrests; (2) his reluctance to permanently abstain from \nalcohol consumption; (3) his binge-alcohol consumption; (4) his resumption of alcohol \nconsumption after previous periods of abstinence and alcohol-counseling attendances; \n(5) his violation of probation by consumption of alcohol, and his failure to disclose that \nviolation to his probation officer; and (6) his abstention from alcohol consumption for less \nthan one year. I have carefully considered the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption. I have lingering doubts and \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment \npertaining to his history of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption security concerns \nare not mitigated.  \n \nCriminal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \n                                            \n9 Pease, 74 M.J. at 769. See also United States v. Clark, NMCCA 201400232 at *13-*17, *22-*23. \n(NMCCCA Jul. 14, 2015) (statements of Dr. Stafford Henry, M.D. and Dr. Thomas Grieger, M.D.). \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nThe SOR alleges, and Applicant admitted he was arrested for misdemeanor-level \ncriminal conduct seven times from 1990 to 2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are established. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions are established for the reasons discussed in the \nalcohol consumption section. Five of the seven incidents of criminal conduct are alcohol \nrelated. For the reasons stated in the section concerning Guideline G, he failed to \nestablish mitigation under Guideline J.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. \u201cIn evaluating an applicant\u2019s case, a \nJudge must carefully consider the record as a whole. This includes not only considering the \nextent to which an applicant\u2019s circumstances raise concerns about his or her reliability but \nalso giving fair consideration of the applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-\n09900 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00424 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. \n20, 2016)). My comments under Guidelines G and J are incorporated in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some \nwarrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has been \nemployed as a calibration technician for his current employer since 2008. He has three \nsemesters of college, and he completed several certified training courses. He has held a \nsecurity clearance for about 31 years. There is no evidence of security violations. His \nspouse had multiple serious illnesses, and he has been very supportive of her. He \nattended marriage counseling and classes. She supported approval of his security \nclearance. His 2017 and 2018 performance reviews indicate he exceeds expectations or \nmeets expectations for all categories. The general sense of the statements of six of \nApplicant\u2019s coworkers, a family support worker, and friends is that he is diligent, reliable, \npeaceful, \ndedicated, \nintelligent, \nprofessional, \nand \ncompliant \nwith \nprocedural \nrequirements,  \n \nThe six factors listed in the alcohol consumption section, supra, weigh against \ngranting Applicant access to classified information. The three most important factors are: \nhe has a lengthy history of five alcohol-related arrests from 1990 to 2015; he relapsed \nafter abstaining from alcohol consumption; and his current abstinence from alcohol \nconsumption is for less than one year before his hearing. Based on these factors, I have \nlingering doubts and concerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. A significant probability of alcohol-related judgment errors in the future \ncontinues to exist, and this possibility of future judgment errors raises ongoing questions \nabout his reliability and trustworthiness. See AG \u00b6 21.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as \nset forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that Guidelines G and J \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.  \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/07/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 23, 2015. On \nMarch 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nG. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. On May 28, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a complete \ncopy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including documents identified \nas Items 1 through 11. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response \nsetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on June 7, 2019, and did not respond. \n\n \n2 \n \nItems 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 11 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on June 17, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I have \nextracted these findings of fact from Applicant\u2019s SOR answer (Item 2) and his 2015 SCA \n(Item 3).  \n \nApplicant, age 38, is unmarried without children. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in \n2003 and served on active duty through at least 2015. During his service, he deployed to \nIraq three times. The record does not specify when or under what conditions he \nseparated. The record also does not specify for how long he has worked for his current \ndefense-contractor employer. He was granted DOD security clearances in 2003 and \n2011. (Item 3; Item 5 at 4 and 6). \n \nThe SOR alleged four incidents of Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption, \ninvolving two Non-Judicial Punishments (NJP) under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice, in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and two Driving Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol (DUI) arrests, in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant \nadmitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. He admitted the underlying arrest and \nconviction, but denied SOR \u00b6 1.d on the basis that certain other facts alleged were \nincorrect.  \n \nWhile on active duty in 2003, Applicant received NJP for drinking alcohol in \nadvanced individual training. The record does not contain any other details about this \nincident. (Item 11 at 30). \n \nWhile on active duty in 2006, Applicant became drunk and disorderly, damaged a \nwall in an unoccupied room, and then became involved in a verbal altercation which \nturned physical when he pushed and choked another soldier. He received NJP for two \noffenses: (1) damage to government property, and (2) drunk and disorderly. The resultant \nactions taken were a letter of concern or counseling (the record does not specify which), \na $429 fine, and a reduction in rank from E-4 to E-3. He was referred to an Army- \nsponsored substance abuse program, which he completed. He admitted that he became \n\u201ccarried away\u201d while drinking with his friends in the barracks that evening, having recently \nreturned from a deployment. He has not had any physical altercations since this incident. \n(Item 5 at 4; Item 7; Item 10; Item 11 at 30 and 43). \n \nWhile on active duty in 2013, Applicant consumed five or six whiskey and cokes at \na bar one night between 7:00 pm and 2:00 am. During his drive home, he was stopped \nby state police at a sobriety checkpoint. After the police officer detected a strong odor of \nan alcoholic beverage emanating from Applicant\u2019s person, three standardized field \nsobriety tests were administered which indicated he was impaired. He was also \nadministered a breath test which measured a .089 breath alcohol content. He was \narrested and charged with DUI. The court later dismissed the charge due to suppression \nof the evidence from the checkpoint. (Item 5 at 4-5; Item 8; Item 10). \n\n \n3 \n \nWhile on active duty in 2015, Applicant consumed two beers at a softball field after \na game. While he was driving home, a civilian police officer stopped him for speeding. \nAfter detecting a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Applicant\u2019s \nperson, the officer administered standardized field sobriety tests, which Applicant failed \nto perform satisfactorily. A preliminary breath test administered during the arrest also \nindicated impairment. He was arrested for DUI. While being processed at the civilian \npolice station, Applicant gave two breath samples, which measured .138 and .137 breath \nalcohol concentrations. He was then transported to the military police station, where he \nwas notified of the suspension or revocation (the record does not specify which) of his \non-post driving privileges. Applicant was later convicted of DUI, and sentenced to 10 days \nin jail (all but one day suspended), fined approximately $1,960, and ordered to complete \n16 hours of DUI education. He completed each requirement. (Item 4; Item 5 at 5-6; Item \n9; Item 10). \n \nDuring a 2015 security clearance interview (SI) with a DOD authorized investigator, \nApplicant described the facts and circumstances of the 2006, 2013, and 2015 incidents \nand his alcohol consumption habits in general. He described himself as a social drinker, \nwho generally consumed approximately three beers or mixed drinks at a time. He did not \nbelieve that he had a drinking problem and had not been diagnosed as alcohol \ndependent. He did not intend to consume any alcohol while undergoing his 16 hours of \nDUI education, which consisted of classes led by a counselor. He had completed 8 hours \nat the time of the SI. He did plan to resume responsible drinking after completing his \nhours, but professed a future intent never to drink and drive again. (Item 5 at 5-7). \n \nIn April 2016, the DOD CAF sent Applicant a SOR alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines G and J (Criminal Conduct), due to three of the incidents alleged in the 2019 \nSOR currently being adjudicated. It did not allege the 2003 incident. In May 2016, \nApplicant responded to the 2016 SOR. He admitted the substance, but not some of the \ndetails, of the alleged incidents, including what, if any, disciplinary or administrative \nactions were taken by Applicant\u2019s command in connection with his 2015 DUI. The record \ndid not specify the outcome of the adjudication of the 2016 SOR or the current status of \nthe DOD security clearances that he was previously granted. (Item 3; Item 5 at 6; Item 6; \nItem 10). \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2018 responses to DOHA-issued interrogatories about his \nalcohol consumption, Applicant reported that he consumed \u201c3-4 beers\u201d two times per \nmonth (most recently August 2018), and \u201c2-3 beers\u201d two times per month (most recently \nJuly 2018). He had not driven after consuming any amount of alcohol since his 2015 DUI. \nInstead, he had either used a ride-sharing service or taken a cab. He had stopped going \nto bars. He concluded his responses with the following statement: \u201cI refuse to let alcohol \naffect my life.\u201d (Item 5 at 9-10, and 12).    \n \nIn addition to the court-ordered actions Applicant took after his 2015 DUI, he also \nvoluntarily refrained from drinking after his softball games, attended a Mothers Against \nDrunk Driving victim impact panel, and completed traffic survival school. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the 2016 SOR included the statement: \u201cI have become aware that I have let \nalcohol be the reason for bad decisions. So, I have established a strong support system \n\n \n4 \n \nwith my friends and family to help me be more responsible.\u201d He declared that with the \nhelp of his \u201cstrong support system,\u201d DUI incidents will not occur again. (Item 10). \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander-in-Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \n\n \n5 \n \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol consumption, involving the 2006, 2013, \nand 2015 incidents alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c., and 1.d, establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nThe NJPs alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are not themselves disqualifying under \nGuideline G. Rather, they are the consequences of potentially disqualifying conduct. \nBecause there are no facts in the record that \u201cexcessive\u201d alcohol consumption was \ninvolved in the incident underlying the 2003 NJP (SOR \u00b6 1.a), it does not independently \nestablish any disqualifying conditions. By contrast, the conduct underlying the 2006 NJP \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) is disqualifying. \n \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \n\n \n6 \n \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \n \nThe incidents alleged in the SOR resulted from circumstances not likely to recur. \nApplicant exercised extremely poor judgment by driving his vehicle after consuming \nalcohol in 2013 and 2015, and by failing to control his impulses after consuming alcohol \nin 2006. Since then, Applicant has demonstrated a pattern of responsible consumption of \nalcohol. He has taken the necessary precautions, by using a ride-sharing service or taking \na cab, to avoid driving a vehicle on any occasion that he has consumed alcohol. He \nstopped going to bars and drinking after his softball games. In over four years, he has not \ndriven a vehicle after consuming alcohol. In over 13 years, he has not been involved in \nany physical altercations. He has a strong support system to assist in his ongoing efforts. \nBecause he has not been diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder, he is not required to \nabstain from consuming alcohol. Applicant has demonstrated a sufficient pattern of \nmodified behavior for me to conclude that the questionable judgment and lack of control \nassociated with the incidents of his excessive alcohol consumption in 2006, 2013, and \n2015 are behind him.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s three tours in Iraq merit special \nrecognition. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline G, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his history of excessive alcohol \nconsumption. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate financial considerations, but did mitigate foreign \ninfluence security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 8, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations) and Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 29, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on September 21, 2018. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on November 14, 2018, and had 30 days to submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The \n02/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment\u2019s documents, identified as Items 1 through 7, were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on February 12, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about China or the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). (Item 8) The \nrequest and the attached source documents were not admitted into evidence but were \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I.  \n \nThe request listed supporting documents to show detail and context for those \nfacts. AG \u00b6 6, Foreign Influence, provides, \u201cAdjudication under this Guideline can and \nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d A risk assessment in this case \nnecessitates administrative notice of facts concerning the PRC.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the HE I source documents, and incorporated them by reference. The facts \nare summarized in the written request and will not be repeated in this decision. \nHowever, of particular note, are the following salient facts gleaned from HE 1. \n \nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA \n \nThe National Counterintelligence Executive has identified China and Russia as \nthe most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information and technology. China's \nintelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, frequently seek to \nexploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider \naccess to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable media devices or e-mail. \n \n In assessing the military and security developments in China, the DOD has \nreported that: Chinese actors are the world's most active and persistent perpetrators of \neconomic espionage. Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological and economic \ninformation will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and persistent \nthreat to U.S. economic security. The nature of the cyber threat will evolve with \ncontinuing technological advances in the global information environment. Chinese \nleaders are focused on developing the capabilities they deem necessary to deter or \n\n \n3 \n \ndefeat adversary power projection and counter third-party including U.S. intervention \nduring a crisis or conflict. China's military modernization is producing capabilities that \nhave the potential to reduce core U.S. military technological advantages. \n \nFurther, the DOD found that China very likely uses its intelligence services and \nemploys other illicit approaches that violate U.S. laws and export controls to obtain key \nnational security and export-restricted technologies, controlled equipment, and other \nmaterials unobtainable through other means. China is using its cyber capabilities to \nsupport intelligence collection against the U.S. diplomatic, economic, and defense \nindustrial base sectors that support U.S. national defense programs. China uses state-\nsponsored industrial and technical espionage to increase the level of technologies and \nexpertise available to support military research, development, and acquisition. \n \nThe organizational network of China's military-industrial complex is such that the \nPeople's Liberation Army (PLA) is able to access sensitive and dual-use technologies or \nknowledgeable experts under the guise of civilian research and development. China has \nin place a long-term, comprehensive military-modernization program designed to \nimprove its armed forces' capacity to fight short-duration, high-intensity-regional \nconflicts and, as China's global footprint and international interests grow, its military \nmodernization program has become progressively more focused on investments for a \nrange of missions beyond China's periphery. \n \nIn assessing the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic \nrelationship between the U.S. and China, the U.S.-China Economic and Security \nReview Commission has reported: Since at least the mid-2000s, the Chinese \ngovernment has conducted large-scale cyber-espionage against the United States. \nChina has compromised a range of U.S. networks, including those of DoD, defense \ncontractors, and private enterprises. China's material incentives for continuing this \nactivity are immense and unlikely to be altered by small scale U.S. actions. China's \nprogress modernizing its defense industry is due in large part to China's substantial and \nsustained investment in defense research and development (R&D). China's large-scale, \nstate-sponsored theft of intellectual property and proprietary information also has \nallowed China to fill knowledge gaps in its domestic defense and commercial R&D. \n \nWith respect to human rights concerns observed in China, the U.S. Department \nof State reported: The People's Republic of China (PRC) is an authoritarian state in \nwhich the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the paramount authority. CCP members \nhold almost all top government and security apparatus positions. Repression and \ncoercion have markedly increased recently, particularly against organizations and \nindividuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy, and public interest and ethnic \nminority issues, and against law firms that took on sensitive cases. \n \nHuman rights concerns that were observed included: extralegal measures to \nprevent public expression of critical opinions; repression of free speech, religion, \nassociation, assembly and movement for certain minorities; extrajudicial killings; \nenforced disappearance and incommunicado detention, including prolonged detentions \nin \"black jails\"; torture and coerced confessions of prisoners; detention and harassment \n\n \n4 \n \nof individuals who sought to peacefully exercise their rights under the law; a lack of due \nprocess; searches of premises without warrants; monitoring of communications; \nopening of domestic and international mail; as well as severe restrictions on citizens' \nfreedom of association and free speech.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. He was born in the United States (U.S.) and obtained a \ngraduate equivalency diploma in 1995. He completed some college courses but did not \nobtain a degree. Applicant married in 2003 and divorced in 2012. He has two children \nfrom that marriage, ages 13, and 14. He married again to a Chinese national on April 9, \n2016. She moved in with Applicant and brought her own two children to join his two \nbiological children. Applicant\u2019s wife is a resident alien in the U.S. She has a green card \nand is presently in the process of applying for citizenship. She signed official documents \nrenouncing her Chinese citizenship and she is a stay-at-home mother to the four \nchildren. Applicant has never traveled to China, and he has no intent to do so. He owns \nno property, bank accounts, or other assets in China. Applicant has been employed as \na senior-systems-engineer for a federal contractor since March 2016. He reports a \nprevious security clearance from 2010.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions or security \nclearance application (SCA) on April 13, 2016.2 In his personal subject interview (PSI) \nwith a clearance investigator on May 15, 2017, he disclosed that his wife\u2019s parents, her \nbrother, and her sister, are citizens and residents of PRC. It is unclear whether her \nsiblings in the PRC have any affiliation with the PRC government or intelligence \nservices. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is 77 years old and suffering from late stage \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. He is retired as an office clerk from a home loan agency in PRC. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law has always been a housewife-mother. It is unclear whether \neither in law has any affiliation with the Chinese government, or whether Applicant and \nhis wife will inherit property located in China when they pass away. Applicant\u2019s wife has \ncontact by telephone with her mother, in China, once a week. She owns no property or \nbank accounts in PRC.  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in section 26 of his SCA that he had back surgery in July \n2005 and he lost significant income as he was out of work for a period of time. Applicant \nwas unemployed from January 2002 to April 2003, and he had other shorter periods of \nunemployment after that. He avers that his unemployment combined with his 2012 \ndivorce and uncovered medical expenses for himself, his current wife, and his children, \ncaused his financial problems.  \n \n \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that the federal-tax-lien in the amount \nof $2,482 at SOR \u00b6 1.a would be paid by December 2018. No explanation of how this \n                                                          \n1 Unless otherwise stated, the basis for these findings of fact is Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SCA) dated April 13, 2016, (Item 3) and the summary of his clearance interview by a \nclearance investigator on May 15, 2017. (Item 4) \n \n2 Item 3. \n\n \n5 \n \ntax lien arose, or documentation showing that it was paid, was provided. The federal tax \nlien imposed in 2014 in the amount of $194,839 arose from tax years (TYs) 2007 and \n2008 when Applicant inherited valuable stocks, which he sold to buy a home. \nInexplicably, Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns timely for those TYs \nand the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assumed that the money from the converted \nstocks was ordinary income.3 Thus, he owed additional income taxes. He attached IRS \nForms 1040 (income tax returns) for TYs 2007 and 2008, to his answer. Both were \nsigned and submitted on August 24, 2018. His problems were exacerbated when he \nreceived duplicate W-2 forms from his employer in 2012. Applicant claims (without \nsubstantiation) that he contacted the IRS and hired a tax attorney to help sort this out. It \nis unclear, what was done by the attorney, but the tax lien in SOR \u00b6 1.b still stands.   \n \n \nIn 2014 \u2013 2015, Applicant was out of work for several months each year, and he \nstruggled to keep up with the $525 per month payments on his family vehicle. It was \nvoluntarily repossessed, sold at auction, and a $10,866 deficiency resulted, as reflected \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. While Applicant claims to be making payments pursuant to a plan on this \ndebt, in the amount of $100 per paycheck for two years, no evidence of actual \npayments was provided. Similarly, he claims that the medical debt for $85 in SOR \u00b6 1.o \nhas been paid in full, but provided no evidence of payment.   \n \n \nIn SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant has disputed the debt in the amount of $1,756 since \n2013. He claims to have made payment in full and returned the two devices to a \ntelecommunications provider. However, he provided no correspondence with the \ncreditor documenting the dispute. The remainder of the delinquencies alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.o are for medical debts that were not covered by health insurance. In \nhis answer, Applicant stated he made a commitment to pay the remaining medical debts \nby December 2018. He provided no documentary evidence that he has done so. He \ncontends that his ex-wife was ordered by the court to pay for half of the children\u2019s \nmedical expenses. Applicant has been working with her to pay some of the medical \ndebts and he attached a few receipts evidencing payment of some random moving \nexpenses, consumer loans, pay-day loans, and medical bills to his answer. It is unclear \nwhich SOR debts these documents pertain to, if any.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n                                                          \n3 Answer to SOR. \n\n \n6 \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;   \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n           (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \n           tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as  \n           required.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal-tax-liens and delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are \nconfirmed by his credit reports and answer to the SOR. The Government produced \nsubstantial evidence to support the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), \nand 19(f), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.4 Applicant has not met that burden. The tax liens and  \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR have not been adequately addressed.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n                                                          \n4 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n8 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant endured back surgery, a divorce, and periods of unemployment several \nyears ago. Arguably, these conditions were beyond his control. Yet, despite his \nknowledge three years ago that his tax liens and delinquencies might affect his eligibility \nfor a security clearance when he completed his SCA, and then reinforcing his intention \nto make payment arrangements two years ago in his PSI, he has done nothing \ndemonstrable to resolve these federal-tax-liens and delinquent accounts. He has \nproduced no relevant or responsive documentation either with his Answer to the SOR, \nor in response to the FORM. He has not demonstrated that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Applicant has the burden to provide sufficient evidence to show that \nhis financial problems are under control, and that his debts were incurred under \ncircumstances making them unlikely to recur.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n9 \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC. \nPRC is continuously engaged in cyber-espionage against the United States, economic \nespionage, and human rights abuses. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts may create a \npotential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and through his family members. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \nand \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.5  \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the U.S. over \nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing whether \nan applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S., or \nthe foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States and he is a U.S. citizen. He is married to \na former Chinese national, who renounced her Chinese citizenship, and applied for U.S. \ncitizenship. She dutifully telephones her mother in China a few times a week. There is \nno indication that Applicant speaks Chinese, or speaks to his mother-in-law at all during \nthese phone calls. His father-in-law has terminal stage dementia and doesn\u2019t speak. \nApplicant never traveled to PRC, nor does he plan to. He holds no accounts or property \nthere. He has longstanding relationships and loyalties here in the U.S. Although his wife \nhas parents in the PRC, which is an authoritarian regime, her contact with them is de-\nminimis. Applicant\u2019s contact is virtually non-existent. There is no indication that his in- \nlaws are affiliated with the Chinese government or intelligence services. Applicant is \ncommitted to his life here. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) are applicable to the PRC family \nmembers contacts, which are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. Because Applicant\u2019s ties to the \nPRC are minimal and inconsequential, I find that all foreign influence concerns have \nbeen mitigated.  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n11 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated foreign influence but not the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:                       FOR Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:                                   For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n      ________________________ \n \n \n \n \n     Robert J.

Schachter, Esq. \n06/27/2019 \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \n \nDepartment Counsel withdrew the sole financial considerations security concern, \nand Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations) and Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 2, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to an administrative judge on \nJanuary 24, 2018, and reassigned to me on March 25, 2019. The Defense Office of \n\n \n2 \n \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 1, 2019, scheduling \nthe hearing for May 14, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government\u2019s discovery letter, exhibit \nlist, and administrative notice request, as well as Applicant\u2019s exhibit list and \nadministrative notice request, were appended to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I \nthrough IV. I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 in evidence without objection. \nI sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 3, consisting of a report of investigation (ROI) \nsummarizing background interviews conducted on June 30, 2008 and July 26, 2016, \nand GE 3 was not admitted in evidence. Applicant testified, called four witnesses, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through O, which I admitted in evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 3, 2019. \n \nOn June 5, 2019, I proposed to the parties that this case was appropriate for a \nsummary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Department Counsel had ten days from \nreceipt of my e-mail to object to my issuance of a summary disposition. She did so on \nJune 6, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nRequests for Administrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s requests that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about the Republic of Korea (South Korea) were included in the record \nas HE II and HE IV, as referenced above. Neither party objected to the other\u2019s request. I \nhave taken administrative notice of the facts contained in HE II and HE IV. The facts \nadministratively noticed are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the allegation in SOR 1.a. He admitted in part and denied in \npart SOR 2.a, and he denied SOR 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d. At the hearing, Department \nCounsel withdrew SOR 1.a. (Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 48-52). \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old, native-born U.S. citizen. After he graduated from high \nschool, he attended college but did not earn a degree. He enlisted in the U.S. military \nand honorably served from 1981 until he retired in 2001. He has worked for various \nDOD contractors since 2002. He worked for a DOD contractor in Iraq from 2009 to \n2011. He has worked in South Korea for his current employer, a DOD contractor, since \nlate 2015. He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Tr. at 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-\nO). \n \nApplicant married in 1986, divorced in 1989, and remarried in 1994. His spouse \nwas born in South Korea. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2004. He met her in \nSouth Korea when he was stationed there in 1992. He obtained permission from the \nU.S. military to marry her, since she was foreign-born. They have resided in South \nKorea since 2002 and do not have any children. (Tr. at 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-O). \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s two sisters-in-law, their spouses, and their children, are citizens and \nresidents of South Korea. His third sister-in-law passed away in 2017. Applicant does \nnot communicate with his in-laws because he does not speak Korean and they do not \nspeak English. His wife maintains regular telephonic communication with her sisters, \nand they see each other in person at family gatherings once every three to six months. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s in-laws are affiliated with the South Korean government or military. \nApplicant\u2019s nephew performed mandatory service in the South Korean military for 21 \nmonths. He completed that service in August 2017 and has since worked as an internet \nmodel selling clothes. (Tr. at 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-O). \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse owns an apartment in South Korea that is their primary \nresidence. She purchased it in 2010 for $256,000 USD, and its current approximate \nvalue is $280,000 USD. He does not own any property in South Korea. When he \ncompleted his security application (SCA) in 2016, he thought his spouse had opened a \nbank account in South Korea when they moved there in 2002. In fact, his spouse had \nnot done so and they do not have any bank accounts in South Korea. Their assets in \nthe United States total approximately $500,000. (Tr. at 48-49, 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-O). \n \nApplicant\u2019s numerous character witnesses attested to his loyalty to the United \nStates, trustworthiness, honesty, and integrity. (Tr. at 22-46, 109-126; AE E). \n \nSouth Korea  \n \nThe signing of the Treaty of Peace on May 22, 1882 marked the first official \ndiplomatic interaction between the United States and South Korea. Following the end of \nWorld War II in 1945, the United States has only maintained diplomatic relations with \nSouth Korea, and has had no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea. South Korea \nis one of the United States\u2019 most important strategic and economic partners in Asia. \n \nSouth Korean government espionage and collection activities have resulted in \ncriminal prosecutions by the U.S. Government. Industrial espionage remains a high \nprofile concern relating to South Korea and South Korean companies. South Korea has \nalso been the unauthorized recipient of technology controlled under U.S. export control \nlaws, including material that could be used in encryption software, optics and prism \ndata, and infrared detectors and camera engines. The U.S. Department of Justice has \nhighlighted numerous efforts by South Korean persons and corporations to secure \nproprietary and/or export-controlled information in contravention of U.S. law. \n \nIn 2017, the most significant human rights issues in South Korea included \ngovernment interpretation and application of the national security law, libel laws, and \nother laws that limited freedom of expression and restricted internet access; corruption; \nand domestic violence. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG 6:       \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \n\n \n6 \n \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). AG 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened \nrisk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s third sister-in-law in South Korea passed away in 2017. His one \nnephew, who performed mandatory service in the South Korean military for 21 months, \ncompleted that service in August 2017 and has since worked as an internet model selling \nclothes. None of the remaining family members in South Korea are affiliated with the \nSouth Korean government or military. Neither Applicant nor his spouse have any bank \naccounts in South Korea. AG 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) are not established for SOR 2.b \nand 2.d, and I find those allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s two sisters-in-law, their spouses, and their children are \ncitizens and residents of South Korea. Applicant\u2019s wife maintains regular telephonic and \nin person contact with her sisters. Applicant\u2019s spouse owns an apartment in South \nKorea that is their primary residence. Its current value is approximately $280,000 USD. \nSouth Korean government espionage and collection activities have resulted in criminal \nprosecutions by the U.S. Government, and industrial espionage remains a high profile \nconcern relating to South Korea and South Korean companies. AG 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and \n7(f) are established for SOR 2.a and 2.c.  \n \nAG 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse maintains regular contact with her family in South Korea, as \npreviously discussed. AG 8(c) does not apply to SOR 2.a. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to South Korea. While the value of his \nwife\u2019s apartment in South Korea is $280,000 USD, their assets in the United States total \napproximately $500,000. The concerns over Applicant\u2019s ties to South Korea, through his \nwife\u2019s family there and her ownership of an apartment there, do not create doubt about \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. AG 8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) apply to SOR 2.a and 2.c. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this \nguideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.), and all of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. through 2.j.), claiming that the citizenship and residence of his family members and the issues regarding his debts have no bearing on his trustworthiness and do not compromise his ability to hold a security clearance. Other than those brief comments, Applicant offered no facts or explanations addressing the specifics of the allegations in the SOR. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a manager, advanced verification, since he joined his employer in February 2016. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a foreign university in 1991; and a master\u2019s degree from a university in the United States in 1995. He has never served with the U.S. military or any other military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was married in 1996, and he reports one child, born in 2006. 2 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See McLeod v.

    "full_text": "1 \n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n--- \n) \nISCR Case No. 18-01653 \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Bryan Olmos, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations, but did mitigate the foreign influence concerns. Eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 21, 2016, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a set of interrogatories, essentially to confirm the \naccuracy of reports of subject interviews conducted by investigators from the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant responded to the interrogatories on June 25, \n2018. That same day, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified \n(Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security \n02/27/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and F \n(Financial Considerations) and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case \nfile. In a sworn statement, dated August 3, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on September 14, 2018, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the \nFORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In \naddition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the \nAdjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on October \n10, 2018. Applicant apparently chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of November \n30, 2018, he had not done so. The case was assigned to me on January 25, 2019.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh (Bangladesh) \nappearing in eight U.S. Government publications which were identified, but only \nfragments of extracts of those publications were attached to the request.1 Facts are \nproper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized source \nand relevant and material to the case. In this instance, the Government relied on source \ninformation regarding Bangladesh in publications of the U.S. Department of State and the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. AG \u00b6 6, Foreign Influence, provides, \u201cAssessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is known to \ntarget U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk \n                                                          \n1 Item 9 (Request for Administrative Notice \u2013 Bangladesh, dated September 13, 2018). The \npublications cited are: U.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian, A Guide to the United States\u2019 \nHistory of Recognition, Diplomatic, and Consular Relations, by Country, since 1776: Bangladesh; Central \nIntelligence Agency, The World Factbook: Bangladesh (Aug 21, 2018); U.S. Department of State, U.S. \nRelations with Bangladesh (Aug 15, 2018); U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, \nOverseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), Bangladesh 2018 Crime & Safety Report (Mar 6, 2018); U.S. \nDepartment of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Bangladesh Travel Advisory (Jul 3, 2018); U.S. \nDepartment of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information: Bangladesh International Travel \nInformation (Jul 3, 2018); U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Counterterrorism and Countering Violent \nExtremism, Country Reports on Terrorism 2016: South and Central Asia: Bangladesh (Jul 2017); U.S. \nDepartment of State, Bureau of Human Rights, Democracy, and Labor, Executive Summary: Bangladesh \n2017 Human Rights Report (Apr 20, 2018). \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nof terrorism.\u201d A risk assessment in this case necessitates administrative notice of facts \nconcerning Bangladesh. \n \nApplicant did not object to the administrative notice request, and he did not offer \nany evidence to refute or rebut any of the enumerated facts therein. After weighing the \nreliability of the source documentation and assessing the relevancy and materiality of the \nfacts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I \ntake administrative notice of certain facts,2 as set forth below under the Bangladesh \nsubsection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to foreign influence in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.), and all \nof the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. \nthrough 2.j.), claiming that the citizenship and residence of his family members and the \nissues regarding his debts have no bearing on his trustworthiness and do not compromise \nhis ability to hold a security clearance. Other than those brief comments, Applicant offered \nno facts or explanations addressing the specifics of the allegations in the SOR. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a manager, advanced verification, since he joined his employer in February 2016. \nApplicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a foreign university in 1991; and a master\u2019s \ndegree from a university in the United States in 1995. He has never served with the U.S. \nmilitary or any other military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was \nmarried in 1996, and he reports one child, born in 2006.  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n2 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); \nISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. \n12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information or sources \nfrom the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous \ndocuments). In this instance, although Department Counsel has selected only certain pages of facts \nappearing in the identified publications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered \nthe publications in their entirety. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nForeign Influence3 \n \n \nApplicant was born in Bangladesh. He entered the United States in 1994, and he \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005. Applicant\u2019s parents are both residents and \ncitizens of Bangladesh. His father worked in education until he retired nearly 25 years \nago, and his mother worked in family planning until she retired over 22 years ago. Both \nparents are in their 70s or 80s. Applicant has two brothers who are also residents and \ncitizens of Bangladesh. One brother works for a private company associated with the \nconstruction business, and his other brother owns his own business. None of those family \nmembers were affiliated with a foreign government, military, security, or intelligence \nservice. Applicant speaks with his parents monthly, and he travels to Bangladesh to visit \nthem every one to two years. He speaks and texts his brothers monthly, and he sees \nthem whenever he visits his parents. His relationship with one sister is more distant, and \nwhile he infrequently exchanges texts and e-mails, he has not seen her since 2014. His \nrelationship with his other sister is generally non-existent, and he has not had any contact \nwith her, or seen her, since 2005. Applicant has contributed approximately $1,000 every \nthree to six months to one of his brothers to assist with their parents\u2019 needs. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was also born in Bangladesh, and she too is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. Both of her parents were born in Bangladesh, but they were naturalized U.S. \ncitizens and residents of the United States. Her father passed away in 2016. \n \nBangladesh \n \nBangladesh is located on the northern edge of the Bay of Bengal; it is bordered on \nthree sides by India and shares a small border with Burma. Approximately 160 million \npeople inhabit Bangladesh, which has a land area of 55,598 square miles, slightly less \nthan that of Iowa. It is the eighth most populous nation in the world and the most densely \npopulated country, aside from some city states and tiny island nations.  \n \nOriginally part of British India, after the partition of British India in 1947, the entity \nknown initially as East Bengal and then East Pakistan was established. In April 1972, \nfollowing a war between India and Pakistan, the United States recognized East Pakistan as \nBangladesh - a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature. The nation is a \ndeveloping country with severe infrastructure shortcomings. Outside of Dhaka, tourist \nfacilities are under-developed as are capacities to deal with emergency situations. \n  \nDespite some earlier military coups following independence, Bangladesh has made \nsignificant progress toward a more prosperous and pluralistic society since its independence \nin 1971. Bangladesh returned to democratic rule in December 2008. Bangladesh\u2019s economy \nhas grown at 6 percent annually for more than two decades. The United States remains \n                                                          \n3 To protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy, the facts in this decision do not specifically describe \nemployment, names of individuals, groups, or locations. The cited sources: Item 3 (e-QIP, dated January \n21, 2016); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated January 3, 2017); Item 4 (Subject Contact, dated \nJanuary 6, 2017); Item 4 (Subject Contact, dated January 10, 2017); Item 4 (Triggered Enhanced Subject \nInterview, dated December 7, 2017); and Item 4 (Triggered Enhanced Subject Interview, dated April 26, \n2018) contain more specific information. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nactively engaged in efforts to strengthen respect for labor rights and improve workplace \nsafety. Despite significant development achievements, poverty remains a challenge. \nInfrastructure shortcomings, weak governance structures, and potential terrorist exploitation \nby extremist groups are also vulnerabilities. The fact that Bangladesh is one of the world\u2019s \nmost densely populated countries compounds these challenges. \n \nU.S. Assistance to Bangladesh  \n \nBangladesh is the largest recipient of U.S. assistance in Asia outside of Afghanistan \nand Pakistan. U.S. assistance fosters engagement with the Government of Bangladesh and \ncomplements support from other donors to address the underlying social, demographic, and \neconomic factors that threaten democratic governance, stifle economic growth, and increase \nvulnerability to extremism in Bangladesh. The United States continues to build upon previous \ngains to reduce poverty, improve health and education, mitigate the impact of natural \ndisasters, and achieve better governance to spur equitable and sustainable growth.  \n \nBilateral Economic Relations  \n \nThe United States exports to Bangladesh include agricultural products (cotton, wheat, \ndairy), aircraft, machinery, and iron and steel products. The United States is Bangladesh\u2019s \nsingle largest importer of goods including apparel, other textile products, headgear, shrimp \nand prawns, and agricultural products (primarily tobacco). The two countries conduct annual \ntalks under a Trade and Investment Cooperation Framework Agreement (TICFA) signed in \n2013.  \n  \nBangladesh's Membership in International Organizations  \n \nBangladesh and the United States belong to a number of the same international \norganizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN Regional Forum, International Monetary \nFund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. The United States and Bangladesh \ncooperate closely on security issues, ranging from counterterrorism to peacekeeping.  \n  \nHuman Rights and Terrorism in Bangladesh \nBangladesh's legal system is based on common law, and its principal source of \nlaws are acts of Parliament. Although human rights are enshrined in the country's \nconstitution, government and security forces have been known to flout constitutional \nprinciples and have been accused of human rights abuses. In a 2017 Human Rights \nReport, the U.S. Department of State stated that the most significant human rights issues \nincluded extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary or unlawful detentions, and forced \ndisappearances by government security forces; restrictions on civil liberties, including \nfreedom of speech, press, and the activities of nongovernmental organizations; a lack of \nfreedom to participate in the political process; corruption; violence and discrimination \nbased on gender, religious affiliation, caste, tribe, including indigenous persons; \ntrafficking in persons; and restrictions on worker\u2019s rights and the worst forms of child labor. \nIn addition to the usual criminal activities of some persons in the society, several \nanti-Western Islamic terrorist groups have engaged in a variety of attacks against diverse \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \ngroups and individuals, including students, Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Shia, and \nsecular bloggers. Americans have not been specifically targeted for terrorist activity \nsimply because they are Americans, but there is a current terrorist threat of attack against \nWesterners in Bangladesh. Counter-terrorism raids have been conducted by the \ngovernment. The U.S. Department of State has assessed Dhaka and Chittagong as being \nhigh-threat locations for crime and terrorist activity, including such activity directed at or \naffecting official U.S. government interests.  \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s family members resided well outside (more than 200 miles) \nthe two cited areas of heightened risk, some of them moved several years ago to one of \nthose areas.4  \nApplicant\u2019s Travel to Bangladesh \n \nSince becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has traveled to Bangladesh on at least six \noccasions, visiting his family members for periods of up to 21 days each. He was never \ncontacted by or had any contact with any person known or suspected of being involved or \nassociated with foreign intelligence, terrorists, security, or military organizations. He was \nnever in contact with anyone exhibiting excessive knowledge or undue interest in him or his \njob. He was not in contact with anyone attempting to obtain classified information or \nunclassified, sensitive information. He was never threatened, coerced, or pressured in any \nway to cooperate with a foreign government official or foreign intelligence or security service. \nHe was never threatened, coerced, pressured, put under duress or blackmailed because of \nrelatives, friends, or other contacts living in Bangladesh.5 \n \nFinancial Considerations6 \nIt is unclear when Applicant first started having financial difficulties, although he \nacknowledged that during an unspecified period leading up to October 2007, a business \nwith his personal guarantees went under. As a result, in October 2007, Applicant and his \nwife filed a joint petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \nciting $242,800 in creditors holding secured claims; and $602,402 in creditors holding \nunsecured nonpriority claims, totaling $845,202 in total liabilities. On May 6, 2008, \nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged.7 In January 2016, when completing his e-QIP, \nApplicant denied any financial issues such as delinquencies, collections, or accounts \nbeing charged off. In January 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the \nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that initial interview, Applicant \nstated that since his bankruptcy discharge, he re-established his credit, and that his \n                                                          \n4 Item 4 (January 3, 2017), supra note 3, at 3. \n \n5 Item 4 (January 6, 2017), supra note 3, at 16-17. \n \n6 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: Item 7 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated February \n9, 2016); Item 8 (Equifax Credit Report, dated June 21, 2018); Item 5 (Bankruptcy File, various dates); Item \n6 (Debt Negotiation Agreement, dated September 20, 2017); Item 4, supra note 3.  \n \n7 Item 5, supra note 6. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nfinancial status since the bankruptcy is stable. He added that he feels he is capable of \nmeeting his current financial obligations.8  \nDuring a subsequent OPM interview in December 2017, Applicant acknowledged \nthat despite the bankruptcy discharge, he still owed large amounts of undocumented \nmoney to family and friends. In addition, he was caring for his parents, resulting in multiple \noverseas trips, and medical and living expenses for them. Because of the bankruptcy, he \ncontinued to borrow money from non-conventional sources with high interest rates to \nkeep up with payments and living expenses. With insufficient funds to maintain his \naccounts, in September 2017, he engaged the professional services of a company that \nperforms debt negotiations to provide debt relief.9 Under that agreement, Applicant \nagreed to make $1,514 in monthly payments to the debt company commencing on \nOctober 6, 2017, and the debt company would attempt to negotiate debt relief regarding \n23 different accounts totaling $117,230.10 Applicant did not submit any documentation, \nsuch as cancelled checks, bank statements, receipts, etc., to indicate that any monthly \npayments were made to the debt company, or that any payments were made by Applicant \nor the debt company to any of Applicant\u2019s creditors.  \nAt the end of his December 2017 interview, Applicant was questioned about a \nsubstantial number of cash transactions, each in excess of $10,000, that were made \nthroughout the period 2005 through 2017 at various casinos in several states. Applicant \nwas reluctant to answer questions regarding the casinos, and specifically refused to \nanswer questions pertaining to the frequent transactions. He did, however, acknowledge \nthat since he was struggling financially, and he felt he was good at gambling, he did so to \nwin money to help pay his debts. He acknowledged that \u201csometimes he won,\u201d implying \nthat most of the time he lost. Applicant gambles as a hobby and for fun to perfect his \nskills. He denied having issues with gambling. He denied that gambling ever created any \nfinancial problems for him. Furthermore, Applicant was unsure if he will continue to visit \ncasinos in the future.11  \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 2.b.); his enrollment in a \ndebt relief program covering $117,230 in debts (SOR \u00b6 2.c.); and his casino gambling \nactivities (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), described above, the SOR identified eight delinquent accounts \nthat had been placed for collection or charged off as generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s \nFebruary 2016 or June 2018 credit reports. Those debts, total approximately $57,027. \nAmong the list of creditors the debt company was supposed to contact, are some of the \nSOR-related accounts. There are also a substantial number of accounts in that list, most \n                                                          \n8 Item 4 (January 3, 2017), supra note 3, at 9. \n \n9 Item 4 (December 7, 2017), supra note 3, at 11. \n \n10 Item 6, supra note 6. \n \n11 Item 4 (December 7, 2017), supra note 3, at 12-14; Item 4 (April 26, 2018), supra note 3, at 16. \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nof which had balances between $3,000 and $12,000, which were not alleged in the \nSOR.12  \nApplicant\u2019s outstanding financial obligations alleged in the SOR, all of which \nApplicant simply denied in his Answer to the SOR, but essentially acknowledged to the \ndebt company, are as follows: an unspecified type of account for $6,551, but listed for \n$10,647 in his creditor list (SOR \u00b6 2.d.); a credit card for $1,564 that was charged off, but \nlisted for $715 in his creditor list (SOR \u00b6 2.e.); a credit card for $8,129 that was charged \noff, but listed for $6,471 in his creditor list (SOR \u00b6 2.f.); a credit card for $5,296 that was \ncharged off, but listed for $4,135 in his creditor list (SOR \u00b6 2.g.); a credit card for $1,929, \nbut listed for $1,277 in his creditor list (SOR \u00b6 2.h.); an unspecified type of account for \n$755 that was past due in the amount of $196 (SOR \u00b6 2.i.); an unspecified type of account \nfor $3,760 that was charged off, but listed for $3,614 in his creditor list (SOR \u00b6 2.j.); and \nan unspecified type of account for $22,492 that was charged off, but listed for $22,044 in \nhis creditor list (SOR \u00b6 2.k.).13  \nIn September 2017, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Summary to his debt \ncompany. It indicated that his monthly take-home-pay was $9,000; monthly expenses \nwere $7,406, not including his debt company program payments; leaving a monthly \nremainder of $1,695 if no such program payments were made, or $81 if those program \npayments were made, available for discretionary saving or spending.14 It is not known \nwhat Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did not report his current \nnet monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be \navailable for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. Except \nfor an acknowledgment that he had received credit counseling associated with his 2007 \nbankruptcy, there is no indication that subsequent financial counseling from a legitimate \nand credible source had been received. As noted above, during his initial OPM interview, \nApplicant stated that since his bankruptcy discharge, he re-established his credit, and \nthat his financial status since the bankruptcy was stable. He added that he felt he was \ncapable of meeting his current financial obligations. Facts developed following that \n                                                          \n \n12 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

There is no evidence to indicate that \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is now under control.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d15 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d16   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d17 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \n                                                          \n15 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n16 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n17 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro.

The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.18  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d19  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d20 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6.  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \n                                                          \n18 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n19 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n20 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are both residents and citizens of Bangladesh. His father \nworked in education until he retired nearly 25 years ago, and his mother worked in family \nplanning until she retired over 22 years ago. Both parents are in their 70s or 80s. Applicant \nhas two brothers who are also residents and citizens of Bangladesh. One brother works \nfor a private company associated with the construction business, and his other brother \nowns his own business. None of those family members were affiliated with a foreign \ngovernment, military, security, or intelligence service. Applicant speaks with his parents \nmonthly, and he travels to Bangladesh to visit them every one to two years. He speaks \nand texts his brothers monthly, and he sees them whenever he visits his parents. His \nrelationships with his sisters are more distant, and they were not of any security concern.  \n \n When foreign family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a \nforeign country as well as each individual family member must be analyzed.21 If only one \nrelative lives in a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information.22 The mere possession of close family \nties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. Moreover, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates.23 Furthermore, \u201ceven friendly countries can have profound disagreements with \nthe United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d24 Friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \n                                                          \n21 ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \n \n22 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n23 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004) (\u201cThe United States has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that \nis not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d). \n \n24 ISCR Case No. 00-00317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable \nto government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. It is reasonable to presume that a contentious \nrelationship, or the absence of a democratic government, is not determinative, but it may \nmake it more likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen \nthrough relatives or associates in that foreign country. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue.25  \n \nIn this instance, there is no evidence to reflect that Bangladesh engages in \neconomic espionage or military intelligence activity directed toward the United States. \nBangladesh is the largest recipient of U.S. assistance in Asia outside of Afghanistan and \nPakistan. Moreover, the United States is Bangladesh\u2019s single largest importer of goods. \nMoreover, the United States and Bangladesh cooperate closely on security issues, \nranging from counterterrorism to peacekeeping. The most significant fear is not the official \nactions of the government, but rather the acts of terrorism conducted against individuals \nand groups, not necessarily specifically targeting Americans. Those terrorist activities in \nBangladesh are sufficient to establish a \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 a risk that is greater than the \nnormal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign government where \nterrorist activities frequently take place. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n                                                          \n \n25 See ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) partially apply. As noted above, there is no evidence \nthat Applicant\u2019s relatives have been political activists, challenging the policies of the \nBangladesh Government. There is no evidence these relatives currently work for or have \never worked for the Bangladesh Government, military, or intelligence service. Likewise, \nthere is no evidence that terrorists or the Bangladesh Government have approached or \nthreatened Applicant or his relatives for any reason. And, there is no evidence that those \nfamily members in Bangladesh currently engage in activities which would bring attention \nto them or that they or other Bangladesh elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s work. \nAs such, there is a reduced possibility that these relatives would be targets for coercion \nor exploitation. Furthermore, in this instance, if the most significant \u201cheightened risk\u201d is \nApplicant\u2019s or his family\u2019s potential exposure to terrorist threats, not government \nintervention, residing in Bangladesh is not so different from residing in New York City \n(2001), Paris (2015), Brussels (2016), Orlando (2016), Barcelona (2017), or London \n(2017), the locations of significant terrorist attacks. \n \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty and connections to his family members are positive character \ntraits. However, for security clearance purposes, those same connections with relatives \nliving in foreign countries negate the possibility of full mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and \n8(c), and Applicant failed to fully meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that \n[his relationships with his relatives who are living in foreign countries] could create a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s ties to the United States run relatively \ndeep. He immigrated to the United States 25 years ago, and he has been a naturalized \nU.S. citizen for 14 years. He has worked for U.S. companies, or was self-employed, since \n2004. He has one child born in the United States. His deep relationship with the United \nStates weighs against a security concern for the relationships he has with his retired \nelderly parents and his brothers. His wife and her mother are naturalized U.S. citizens, \nresiding in the United States. His father-in-law passed away. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; \n \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to fund \ngambling or pay gambling debts; and \n \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused by \ngambling. \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s 2007 bankruptcy, his gambling activities, and his debt \nnegotiation agreement, the SOR identified eight delinquent accounts that had been \nplaced for collection or charged off, totaling approximately $57,027. Those accounts \nremain unaddressed and delinquent. His September 2017 Personal Financial Summary \nindicated that his monthly take-home-pay was $9,000; monthly expenses were $7,406, \nnot including his debt company program payments; leaving a monthly remainder of \n$1,695 if no such program payments were made, or $81 if those program payments were \nmade, available for discretionary saving or spending. Because of the absence of more \nrecent information regarding Applicant\u2019s finances over the past few years, it is difficult to \ndetermine if he was unwilling, but able, to address his debts, or simply unable to do so. \nApplicant\u2019s gambling over the years, as well as the large cash transactions associated \nwith casinos that he refused to discuss, remain a security concern. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), \n19(c), 19(e), 19(h), and 19(i) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;26 \n                                                          \n26 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;27 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) minimally apply, but none of the remaining mitigating \nconditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties make it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d \nor that it is \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant failed to explain why or how he got into debt, other \nthan to refer initially to business-related expenses that led to his 2007 bankruptcy, and \nthen his acknowledgment that he concealed other debts with family or friends. He did not \nspecifically attribute his financial difficulties to any identified factors. He offered no \nstatements or documentation to reflect that he had made any efforts, before or after he \nwas interviewed by OPM, or before or after the SOR was issued in June 2018, to: obtain \nfinancial counseling from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service; dispute his delinquent accounts with the credit reporting agencies or \nthe creditors themselves; contact his creditors to set up repayment plans; or indicate that \n                                                          \n \n27 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Normally, an applicant \nwho begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or \nher security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her \nown interests.29 In this instance, there is no evidence of any actions even after receiving \nthe SOR. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, to date, there is no evidence \nthat any corrective actions, other than the 2017 debt negotiation agreement, have been \ntaken by Applicant to reflect any initial or continuing payments to his creditors. There is \nno evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s finances are under control. Applicant\u2019s actions \nunder the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment.30 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n                                                          \n28 See ISCR Case No. 12-01335 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). \n \n29 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n30 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.31   \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 51-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a manager, advanced \nverification, since he joined his employer in February 2016. Applicant\u2019s loyalty and \nconnections to his family members are positive character traits. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant\u2019s 2007 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge involved $845,202 in total \nliabilities. When he completed his e-QIP, Applicant denied having any delinquent \naccounts or charged-off accounts. In doing so he concealed his delinquent accounts. In \n2017, during his initial OPM interview, Applicant stated that since his bankruptcy \ndischarge, he re-established his credit, and that his financial status since the bankruptcy \nwas stable. He added that he felt he was capable of meeting his current financial \nobligations. Both of those statements were inaccurate. During a subsequent OPM \ninterview, Applicant acknowledged that despite the bankruptcy discharge, he still owed \nlarge amounts of money to family and friends. In 2017, he reported to a debt company \nthat he had 23 different accounts totaling $117,230. Applicant did not submit any \ndocumentation, such as cancelled checks, bank statements, receipts, etc., to indicate that \nany monthly payments were made to any of Applicant\u2019s creditors. Applicant\u2019s gambling \nover the years, as well as his unexplained large cash transactions associated with \ncasinos, remain a security concern, especially since he refused to provide details of those \ntransactions. Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is unknown.  \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:32 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \n                                                          \n31 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n32 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n18 \n                                      \n \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, failing to take any meaningful or documented corrective actions with \nrespect to his delinquent debts. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nIn addition, his lack of candor is a concern. For all of these reasons, I conclude while \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence concerns, he has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.d. through 2.k.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 21, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 8, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non January 14, 2019, scheduling the hearing for February 11, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record was left open until March 11, 2019, for \nreceipt of additional documentation. On February 21, 2019, Applicant offered one \n\n \n2 \n \ndocument, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) A and admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on February 26, 2019. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Pakistan. Department Counsel provided a six-page summary of the \nfacts, supported by four Government documents pertaining to Pakistan, identified as GX \n4. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. GX 1 at page 5.) He \nhas been employed with the defense contractor since August of 2014. (GX 1 at page \n13.) He is married to a U.S. citizen. (GX 1 at pages 26~27.) Applicant was born in \nDubai, lived in Pakistan when he \u201cwas 11 or 10\u201d years old,\u201d and has not visited Pakistan \nsince then, and moved to the United States in 2003 as a twenty-year-old. (TR at page \n17 lines 4~14, and GX 1 at page 6.) He is well respected in the workplace, as attested \nto by his \u201cSite . . . Manager.\u201d (AppX A at page 2.) \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \n1.a. Applicant\u2019s 66-year-old mother is a citizen of Pakistan, but has lived in the \nUnited States since 2016. (TR at page 15 lines 13~14, at page 16 lines 1~21, at page \n30 lines 9~24, and at page 31 lines 17~20.) She works for a U.S. corporation, and is \nunaware that Applicant is applying for a security clearance. (Id.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant\u2019s 40-year-old sister is a dual-citizen of Pakistan and Canada, and \nhas lived in Canada since 2012. (TR at page 15 lines 19~21, at page 16 line 22 to page \n17 line 3, at page 18 lines 1~4, and at page 31 lines 17~20.) Like her mother, she is \nunaware that Applicant is applying for a security clearance. (Id.) \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \n2.a. and 2.b. In July of 2006, and again in September of 2006, more than twelve \nyears ago, Applicant was involved domestic disputes with his newly-married wife. (TR at \npage 21 line 6 to page 27 line 16, and at page 28 line 22 to page 30 line 4.) As a result \nof both incidents he was charged, but the charges were subsequently dismissed. (Id.) \nHe has attended anger management classes, and they both have attended \u201cmarriage \nconferences.\u201d (TR at page 21 line 6 to page 27 line 16, at page 28 line 22 to page 30 \nline 4, and AppX A at page 1.) They have been happily married \u201cfor over 12 years,\u201d as \n\n \n3 \n \nattested to by Applicant\u2019s wife. (AppX A at page 1.) She avers that they \u201care devoted to \none another and . . . are committed to make this marriage last.\u201d (Id.) \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding the Islamic Republic \nof Pakistan. Pakistan is a federal republic, but the U.S. Department of State warns U.S. \ncitizens not to travel to Pakistan due to terrorism. Pakistan has suffered numerous \nterrorist attacks. Pakistan has recently also had significant human rights issues.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n4 \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens of Pakistan. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother lives in the United States and his sister in Canada. They have \nlittle knowledge of Applicant\u2019s need for a security clearance. Their situs and lack of \nknowledge vis-\u00e0-vis Applicant do not raise a national security concern. Foreign \nInfluence is found for Applicant. \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \n \nApplicant had two incidents involving domestic disputes in 2006. The evidence \nestablishes the above two disqualifying conditions. \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nSufficient time has passed since Applicant\u2019s 2006 transgressions. He and his \nspouse have sought out and benefitted from marriage counseling. The evidence does \nestablish mitigation under both of these conditions. Criminal Conduct is found for \nApplicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant is respected by his Site \nManager as an \u201coutstanding employee.\u201d  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence and Criminal Conduct security \nconcerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Gregorian, Esq. \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n06/05/2019 \n___________ \n \nDecision \n___________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nIn 2008, Applicant negligently took a classified document home and stored it in a \nfile box in his garage. In 2011, he discovered the document and shredded it. Later in \n2011, he disclosed his negligent handling of the classified document. His negligent \nhandling of the classified document is not recent. Guideline K (handling protected \ninformation) security concerns are mitigated. However, in 2016, he used \ncountermeasures to attempt to manipulate a counterintelligence-polygraph test. Security \nconcerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.      \n  \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn April 19, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On June 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJanuary 2, 1992; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. The SOR set forth security concerns arising under \nGuidelines E and K. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \n \n\n \n2                                         \n \nOn July 23, 2018, Applicant provided a response to the SOR. (HE 3) Department \nCounsel requested a hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 13) On March 13, 2019, the case was \nassigned to me. On April 22, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for May 2, 2019. (HE 1) The hearing was \nheld as scheduled.   \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered \ntwo exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 17-20; GE 1-4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-B) On May 15, 2019, DOHA \nreceived a copy of the hearing transcript.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response admitted the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a. \n(Tr. 21-22; HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \naccepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old Air Force mission planner employed by a government \ncontractor. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) In 1998, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 2018, \nhe received a bachelor of science degree in liberal arts. (Tr. 6) He served in the Air Force \nfrom 1998 to 2008. (Tr. 7, 22) He left active duty as a staff sergeant (E-5), and he received \nan honorable discharge. (Tr. 7) His Air Force specialty was cable-antenna technician, and \nhe cross-trained as an airborne cryptologic linguist. He held a top secret clearance with \naccess to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) starting in 2006. (Tr. 7, 23) He has \nworked for his current employer since September 2017. (Tr. 8) In 1997, Applicant married, \nand his children are ages 16, 18, and 20. (Tr. 8) \n \nRemoval of Classified Document from a SCI Facility (SCIF) \n \n \nApplicant received routine training about handling of classified information. (Tr. 24-\n25, 27) In 2008, Applicant attended training inside a SCIF, which involved his use of \nclassified documents. (Tr. 28) He unintentionally brought a document classified at the \nsecret level to his home, and he stored it in a file box in his garage. (Tr. 28-29; SOR \nresponse) The document was clearly marked as secret. (Tr. 29)2 In about March 2011, \nhe discovered the classified document in his garage. (Tr. 28; 63) He transported the \nclassified document to an Air Force unit where he was working, and he shredded the \ndocument. (Tr. 30) He did not have authorization to transport classified documents \noutside of the SCIF. (Tr. 61) He did not timely disclose his possession at home and \nsubsequent destruction of the classified document because he did not want to get in \n                                            \n1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific information is available \nin the cited exhibits. \n \n2 In Applicant\u2019s April 19, 2016 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security \nclearance application (SCA), Applicant said the document he erroneously took home was \u201cprotected \ninformation\u201d not classified information. (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) At his hearing, he acknowledged that \nit was a classified document, and he conceded it was possible that he was trying to minimize what he had \ndone in his SCA by not characterizing the document as classified. (Tr. 58-59) No adverse inference is made \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s incorrect description of his handling of the classified document in his SCA.  \n\n \n3                                         \n \ntrouble. (Tr. 30-31) Several months after he destroyed the classified document, Applicant \nwas interviewed before his counterintelligence polygraph examination. (Tr. 31, 63) He \ndisclosed to the polygrapher that he mishandled the classified document in 2008, and \ndestroyed it in 2011. (Tr. 31-32, 63-65) He passed the counterintelligence polygraph \nexamination in 2011. (Tr. 65) His security clearance was suspended for about three \nmonths after his 2011 polygraph due to his mishandling of the classified document. (Tr. \n32, 57-58)  \n \nPolygraph Countermeasures \n \nPrior to 2016, Applicant had done some research on methods of manipulating the \npolygraph-test result. (Tr. 45-46, 55-56) In 2016, Applicant was scheduled for a routine \ncounterintelligence-polygraph examination. (Tr. 35) The polygrapher discussed the test \nquestions and polygraph procedures with Applicant during the pre-polygraph interview. \n(Tr. 36-37) Applicant was aware that his rate of breathing could affect the polygraph-test \nresults. (Tr. 66) Before a polygraph examination, the polygrapher tells the person being \ntested to give false answers to control questions about mundane topics such as the \nnumber of times the test taker drove in excess of the speed limit or the number of times \nthe test taker caused a family member to be angered. These control questions are \nconsidered \u201cknown lies.\u201d The physiological responses, including rate of breathing, to the \ncontrol questions are compared to the responses to the questions relevant to \ncounterintelligence issues. (Tr. 38-39, 49-50) To pass the polygraph, there should be \nmore of a physiological response to lying to a control question than telling the truth on a \nrelevant question. \n \nDuring the polygraph examination, the polygrapher accused Applicant of \nattempting to manipulate the polygraph-test results. (Tr. 37) Applicant admitted that he \nwas \u201cbreathing faster and kind of tricked [himself] into being scared\u201d during the control \nquestions. (Tr. 38) He attempted to magnify or exaggerate his responses during the \ncontrol questions. (Tr. 38, 45, 48-49) He said he believed his physiological responses to \nthe control questions were too low, and he became scared. (Tr. 39-40) He was just trying \nto ensure he had the \u201cdesired response\u201d to enable him to pass the polygraph. (Tr. 39-40) \nHe admitted to the polygrapher that he was trying to manipulate the polygraph test \nthrough fast breathing. (Tr. 45) He subsequently told an Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigator that he wanted his answers to the control questions to \u201clight up like a \nChristmas tree.\u201d (Tr. 43) He admitted that he intentionally attempted to manipulate the \npolygraph-test results. (Tr. 44)  \n \nApplicant claimed that during the polygraph he did not understand that his \nmanipulative efforts could cause an erroneous polygraph-test result. (Tr. 50) He believed \nhe was helping the polygrapher receive an accurate test result through his enhancement \nof his responses to the control questions. (Tr. 54) In other words, he did not believe there \nwas any reason to suspect himself of being a counterintelligence concern, and his \nmanipulation was designed to ensure the polygrapher did not erroneously find a \ncounterintelligence issue. He understands now that his efforts to \u201cassist\u201d the polygrapher \nby breathing faster during the control questions did not actually help the polygrapher. (Tr. \n54-55) Applicant has not taken a counterintelligence polygraph after the 2016 test was \nterminated due to his countermeasures. (Tr. 62)     \n\n \n4                                         \n \nApplicant said he accepted responsibility for his decisions, and if he had an \nopportunity to make the same decisions that he made in 2011 and 2016 now, he would \nchoose differently and scrupulously comply with security requirements. (Tr. 67) He had \nno fear of providing answers to the counterintelligence questions, and he would timely \nreport security violations. (Tr. 67)  \n  \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nAn Air Force captain and a program manager described Applicant as careful about \ncompliance with security requirements. (AE A; AE B) Applicant has sound judgment and \nis loyal to the United States. Applicant has an excellent reputation and contributes to \nmission accomplishment. They support continuation of Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5                                         \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \n\n \n6                                         \n \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . . ; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges and Applicant admits that he knowingly increased his rate of \nbreathing on the control questions of his 2016 counterintelligence-polygraph test as a \ncountermeasure to manipulate the test result.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges and Applicant admits that in 2008, he negligently took a \nclassified document from the SCIF to his home, and he stored it in a file box in his garage \nuntil he discovered it in 2011. He transported the classified document to an Air Force unit \nand shredded it in 2011. He disclosed his negligent handling of a classified document \nduring a pre-polygraph interview in 2011. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 15(a), 16(d)(1), and \n16(e). Additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired. \n \nSix personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n7                                         \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, \n2013), concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s negligent handling of the classified document in \n2008 and his improper destruction of the document in 2011. His negligent conduct is not \nrecent. It occurred on two occasions, and it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s attempted manipulation of \nhis polygraph test in 2016. His manipulation was premeditated and intentional. It was \ndesigned to mislead the polygrapher. His attempted countermeasures are relatively \nrecent, serious, and not mitigated.  \n \nHandling Protected Information  \n \nAG \u00b6 33 articulates the security concern for drug involvement: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n\n \n8                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 34 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \nand \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross alleges the same conduct described in the personal conduct \nsection under SOR \u00b6 1.b. The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(b) and 34(g).  \n \nAG \u00b6 35 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns:  \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \nAG \u00b6 35(a) is established for the same reasons AG \u00b6 17(c) is established as \ndiscussed in the personal conduct section. Handling protected information security \nconcerns are mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n9                                         \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines K and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old Air Force mission planner employed by a government \ncontractor. In 2018, he received a bachelor of science degree in liberal arts. (Tr. 6) He \nserved in the Air Force from 1998 to 2008. He left active duty as a staff sergeant, and he \nreceived an honorable discharge. He held a top secret clearance with access to SCI \nstarting in 2006.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and program manager lauded his loyalty, judgment, \ndiligence, and contributions to mission accomplishment. They supported continuation of \nhis access to classified information. \n \nIn 2016, Applicant knowingly and intentionally attempted to manipulate his \nphysiological responses to polygraph-control questions during a counterintelligence \npolygraph examination. AG \u00b6 15 indicates, \u201cOf special interest is any failure to cooperate \nor provide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes.\u201d Applicant\u2019s actions raise serious security concerns. The \nprotection of national security relies on applicants to cooperate with and not to mislead or \nintentionally jeopardize security clearance processes.

Applicant, age 30, is seeking a security clearance in connection with an employment with a federal contractor to work as a personnel security background investigator. He submitted his security clearance application on July 20, 2017, and began working in this position in October 2017. This is Applicant\u2019s first, full-time position as an adult. At the time of the hearing, he earned an hourly wage of $17. After the hearing, he submitted a paystub showing that he had received a raise to $23.50 per hour. He is also pursuing a part-time job to increase his income. (AE DD.) During the period May 2015 to October 2017, Applicant worked 30 hours a week, and often less, in an hourly position for a public school district during the school year. He was unpaid for one and one half months each summer. During the school year, his income varied by the number of school days in each month. Some months, his monthly net pay was $800 and in other months, his net pay was half that amount. His hourly rate was about $13-$14. He also maintained part-time employment on an \u201con-call\u201d basis, which provided work on occasional weekends. His hourly rate at his second job started at about $12 and was increased to $15.

Applicant failed to file his federal and state tax returns, as required, for \nfour years and owes taxes to the federal government. He has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his past actions. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \n(Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his 2009, 2010, 2016, and 2017 federal \nand state income tax returns as required and that he is indebted to the federal government \nin the amount of $1,487 for taxes due for 2014. The SOR also alleges that he has a \ndelinquent credit-card account that is in collection in the amount of $1,624. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 18, 2018 (SOR Response). In his \nresponse, he admitted each of the SOR allegations regarding his untimely federal tax \nfilings. He also admitted his federal tax debt for 2014, but asserted that he has made \nsome partial payments on this debt. As for his state tax filings, he admitted the SOR \nallegations regarding 2009, 2010, and 2016, but wrote that he filed his 2017 state tax \nreturn in November 2018. He denied the SOR allegation regarding credit-card debt and \nwrote that he had agreed to a payment plan with the creditor settling this debt and made \nthe last payment on December 7, 2018. He requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on February 13, 2019. On February 21, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling \nthe hearing to be held on March 13, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documents into evidence, which \nwere marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. These exhibits were admitted \ninto the record without objection. Applicant testified and offered 17 exhibits, which were \nmarked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through Q and were admitted without objection. A \ncharacter witness also testified. I left the record open until March 27, 2019, to give \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, I extended the time for him to submit additional evidence until April 22, 2014.  \n \nDuring the period March 16, 2019, through April 16, 2019, Applicant made several \npost-hearing submissions. On April 23, 2019, he requested an additional four months to \nprovide additional evidence. I denied his request on the same day. That correspondence \nis marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. In an attempt to avoid any miscommunication caused \nby Applicant\u2019s multiple and rather confusing post-hearing submissions, Department \nCounsel prepared a list of the exhibits that Applicant submitted. I have marked her May \n3, 2019 list as HE II. In that list, Department Counsel described two documents that she \nhad no record of receiving. I have marked her email identifying those documents as HE \nIII. On May 13, 2019, I emailed Applicant and asked him to confirm the accuracy of \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s list, HE II, and to produce the two missing documents. He was \nunable to produce one of the documents. My email and Applicant\u2019s response are marked \nas HE IV.  \n \nOn May 17, 2019, I received physical copies of all of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nexhibits and created a list of the documents, which I have marked as HE V. I marked \nthese documents as AE R through MM. Absent objection, all of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nexhibits are admitted into the record. I also have marked an email thread regarding the \naccuracy and completeness of this list as HE VI. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on March 27, 2019.  \n\n \n3 \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nBased upon Applicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Response, and after a careful \nreview of his testimony, and that of his character witness, and the documentary evidence \nadmitted into the record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, age 30, is seeking a security clearance in connection with an \nemployment with a federal contractor to work as a personnel security background \ninvestigator. He submitted his security clearance application on July 20, 2017, and began \nworking in this position in October 2017. This is Applicant\u2019s first, full-time position as an \nadult. At the time of the hearing, he earned an hourly wage of $17. After the hearing, he \nsubmitted a paystub showing that he had received a raise to $23.50 per hour. He is also \npursuing a part-time job to increase his income. (AE DD.) \n \nDuring the period May 2015 to October 2017, Applicant worked 30 hours a week, \nand often less, in an hourly position for a public school district during the school year. He \nwas unpaid for one and one half months each summer. During the school year, his income \nvaried by the number of school days in each month. Some months, his monthly net pay \nwas $800 and in other months, his net pay was half that amount. His hourly rate was \nabout $13-$14. He also maintained part-time employment on an \u201con-call\u201d basis, which \nprovided work on occasional weekends. His hourly rate at his second job started at about \n$12 and was increased to $15. His income in 2015 was approximately $19,000, which \nincluded a premature withdrawal from his IRA. His income increased to $30,000 to \n$40,000 in 2016 and 2017,2 but during the summer of 2016, his income dropped so low \nthat he had to take out a loan from a car-title lender to pay his rent. He is still paying off \nthat loan, which is current and is not the subject of an SOR allegation. (Tr. 28-32, 34, and \n42-43; AE C-F, I, L, and P.) \n \nDuring the period 2006 through 2012, Applicant attended college and graduated \nwith a bachelor\u2019s degree. In 2017, he earned a master\u2019s in business administration. He \nworked multiple part-time jobs while earning his degrees. He attended graduate school \nfull time over a two-year period while working for the public school district. He has never \nmarried and has no children. He lived with his father until January 2015 and has lived on \nhis own since then. In January 2016, Applicant\u2019s monthly rent increased to $795 and by \nJanuary 2019, his rent for the same apartment had increased to $1,200. These significant \nrent increases caused Applicant financial stress and difficulty living on his limited income. \n(AE G and H.) \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application, dated July 20, 2017, \n(GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n2 He also withdrew funds from his IRA in both 2016 and 2017. (AE J and K.)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn his SOR Response, Applicant admitted that he failed to file his federal tax returns \nfor 2009 and 2010, when he was 20 and 21 years old, respectively (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b).3 \nHe was a college student at that time. He filed his 2009 tax return after the hearing. The \nreturn reflects an adjusted gross income of $12,751, but the return is incomplete and does \nnot show if he owed any taxes. The Form 1040A that he filed for 2009 indicates that he \nwas entitled to a single exemption worth $3,650 and a standard deduction of $5,700, \nwhich would result in taxable income of $3,401. According to the 2009 wage and income \ntax transcript he submitted after the hearing, his total income tax withholding from the \nwages he earned working at three jobs that year was $691, or 29% of his taxable income. \nThere is no evidence in the record that he owes any taxes for 2009, and it is unlikely that \nhe has any residual tax liability for that year. (AE LL and FF.) \n \n \nAs noted above, Applicant admitted in his SOR Response that he failed to file his \n2010 federal tax return, however, this was erroneous. After the hearing, he provided an \nIRS Account Transcript for 2010, which shows that he filed his tax return on April 15, \n2011, and paid on that date the balance of the taxes due in the amount of $289. (AE GG.) \n \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant provided transcripts for \ntax years 2011 through 2015, which reflect that he filed his tax returns on time each year4 \nand owed no taxes, with the exception of 2014. He owes $1,486 in back taxes for 2014, \nwhich is the subject of the SOR \u00b6 1.e. Initially, the IRS calculated that he was due a refund \nof $1,996, but then it recalculated his taxes and determined he owed $1,866, plus interest \nof $97. Applicant established an installment agreement in October 2016 and made seven \npayments of $100 each. He then defaulted, and the IRS terminated the installment \nagreement in April 2017. (GE 2 at 10, GE 3 at 9-15.)  \n \n \nApplicant failed to file his 2016 and 2017 federal income tax returns, as required. \nAlthough not alleged, he also owes back taxes for those years. He filed these returns \nafter the hearing. In September or October of 2018, he made a $40 payment. In October \n2018, he filed a request with the IRS to establish an installment payment plan, which \nprovided for monthly payments of $60. The IRS rejected his proposed payment plan as \ninsufficient. On January 10, 2019, he submitted a second proposal to pay $100 per month. \nAs of the hearing date, he was waiting for the IRS to respond. After the hearing, the IRS \nresponded and agreed to an installment payment plan pursuant to which Applicant pays \n$100 per month by automatic electronic payment on the 15th of each month. By email \ndated May 15, 2019, Applicant advised that the IRS received its first payment of $100 \nunder the payment plan. In addition, the IRS notified Applicant that he owed $1,573 for \n                                                          \n3 In response to the Government interrogatories, Applicant provided an IRS Account Transcript for 2008, \nwhich shows that he had an adjusted gross income of $5,907 and was due a refund of $172. According to \nthis IRS document, he filed the return on June 1, 2009. (GE 3 at 7.) \n \n4 His 2011 tax transcript shows a filing date of April 30, 2012, which was about 15 days late. He received a \nrefund that year, as well as in 2012 and 2013. (GE 3 at 12.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n2014 and that he owes $2,802 for 2016 and $2,668 for 2017.5 (Tr. 27-28, 37, 40-41, and \n44-45; AE J, K, O, S, T, U, V, W, and AA; HE VI at 1-2.)  \n \n \nWith the help of a tax professional, Applicant filed his 2018 federal tax return on \ntime and was due to receive a small refund. He under withheld on his taxes in 2016 and \n2017 due to his limited income while working two jobs and by incurring a tax penalty for \npremature withdrawals from his IRA.6 In 2018, he corrected his error with the advice of a \ntax professional. His inability to pay his taxes in those years is the reason for his failure \nto file his tax returns in a timely manner. (AE HH.) \n \n \nIn his SOR Response, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and \n1.h that he failed to file his 2009, 2010, and 2016 state tax returns, as required. As noted \nabove, he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i regarding his 2017 state tax return, claiming \nthat he filed this return in November 2018. That return was actually due in April 2018. \nAfter the hearing, he submitted a 2009 state tax return, dated April 15, 2019, and a 2010 \nstate tax return, dated April 8, 2019. In addition, he submitted after the hearing copies of \nhis 2016 and 2017 state tax returns, which were prepared by a tax professional and are \nundated. They reflect that he owes his state $463 and $662 for 2016 and 2017, \nrespectively. In an email sent after the hearing, Applicant wrote that he had determined \nthat he had also failed to file his 2015 state tax return. He submitted a copy of this return, \nwhich was prepared by a tax professional and is undated. The return reflects a tax due of \n$69. He also provided a letter from the state which indicates that he has a zero balance \nfor 2015. In December 2018, he made a payment of $847 to the state for tax year 2017 \nto avoid the state\u2019s threatened garnishment of his pay. After the hearing, he provided \ndocumentation that reflected that he has a zero balance with the state for that year. It \nappears that he has no tax liability to the state for tax year 2017 and earlier.7 A tax \nprofessional prepared his 2018 state tax return, which was filed in a timely manner. (Tr. \n30 and 37-37; AE N at 1-2, S, U, W, BB, CC, JJ, and MM) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges one credit-card debt owed to a bank in the amount of $1,624. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j.) This account became delinquent in April 2017 and was settled in November \n2018. He wrote in an exhibit that he paid this debt with six monthly payments of $117. He \n                                                          \n5 The IRS also calculated that he owed $147 for 2015, which is inconsistent with its July 29, 2018 Account \nTranscript for that year, which reflects a $0 balance. (AE Y; GE 3 at 14.) \n \n6 Applicant testified that his tax error was related to his graduate school, which he described as \u201can up-and-\ncoming vocational school,\u201d not a regular graduate school program. He also admitted that he under withheld \non his payroll taxes. (Tr. 27-28; AE B.) On a related matter, AE B reflects Applicant\u2019s enrollment in June \n2015 in this graduate program, but the exhibit does not show that he earned any credits or graduated. I \naccept Applicant\u2019s assertion in his SCA that he graduated from this educational program as credible \nbecause I found Applicant\u2019s testimony on all subjects to be honest and forthcoming, though with occasional \nconfusion regarding certain issues. (GE 1 at 10.) \n \n7 Applicant attached to his interrogatory responses an August 2018 document that reflects he owes no state \ntaxes for the years 2010 through 2015 and a separate document, dated August 2018, acknowledging that \nhe filed his 2016 return as requested by the state and that he owed nothing further for 2016. (GE 2.) \n\n \n6 \n \nalso provided a December 11, 2018 letter from the credit-card issuer stating that this debt \nwas satisfied. (AE A and M; GE 5 at 2.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR contains ten allegations under Guideline F. The security concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nestablish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), \nand AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 20(a) has been partially established. Applicant failed to \nfile his 2009, 2016, and 2017 federal tax returns and his 2009, 2010, 2016, and 2017 \nstate tax returns, as required, and he failed to pay all of his 2014 federal taxes.8 These \ndeficiencies, however, occurred under somewhat unusual circumstances, are unlikely to \nrecur, and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nIn 2009 and 2010, he was a young college student, who literally worked his way through \ncollege employed in as many as three jobs in one year. His income was minimal, and he \npaid all of his federal and state taxes through his tax withholding. His failure to file his tax \nreturns was merely the result of his young age, his lack of experience in the adult world, \nand an absence of adult supervision.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his federal and state tax returns in 2016 and 2017 in a \ntimely manner is more problematic because he was older, though he was working his \nway through graduate school at the time. He was underemployed in low-wage, hourly \npositions, and he was trying to live on his own at a time when he was not financially \ncapable of doing so. Something had to give, and he made the poor choice that it would \nbe his tax filing and payment responsibilities.  \n \nPrior to the hearing, Applicant did not appreciate that he had to address his tax \nfiling and payment delinquencies, but it is quite evident from his flurry of activity after the \nhearing that he undertook responsible, mature steps to address his tax responsibilities. \nHe filed all of his federal tax returns and negotiated a payment plan with the IRS that he \ncould afford to pay and has begun paying off his total federal tax delinquency of about \n$7,000, which includes the $1,500 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e for 2014. He also filed his 2018 \nfederal and state tax returns and paid all amounts due, as required.  \n \nWith respect to his state returns, Applicant filed the delinquent returns after the \nhearing and had paid his overdue taxes prior to the hearing. He also paid off an \noutstanding credit-card account over a six-month period prior to the hearing in a mature, \nresponsible manner. The fact that his remedial steps took place after his receipt of the \nSOR, and in some instances, after the hearing, prevents me from applying this mitigating \ncondition fully, but I give weight to my conclusion that now that he is employed in his first \n                                                          \n8 The record evidence established that Applicant filed his 2010 tax return and paid his taxes, as required.  \n\n \n9 \n \nadult job earning a proper wage for a person with his education, I strongly believe that \nhis past conduct will not recur.  \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 20(c) has been established because Applicant has \nreceived tax counseling from a tax professional and has addressed and corrected the \nmistakes in his management of his tax responsibilities. Although many of Applicant\u2019s \nmitigating actions took place after the hearing, there is a clear indication that his tax \nproblems are being resolved and are under control. \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 20(d) has been partially established. The evidence shows \nthat Applicant has initiated an effort to pay his delinquent taxes and resolve his past-due \ntaxes and one credit-card account. The fact that his actions post-date his receipt of the \nSOR, however, undercuts a finding of \u201cgood faith\u201d and prevents full application of this \nmitigating condition.  \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 20(g) is also partially established. Applicant has filed all \nof his delinquent tax returns and has paid his state tax debt. The fact that he made his \nfirst payment to the IRS under a new installment payment plan after the close of the \nrecord does not have the same mitigation value as evidence of a series of regular \npayments that demonstrate a significant track record of compliance. Having said that, \nhowever, I am convinced that Applicant is committed to paying his federal tax debt and \nwill continue to do so over the coming months and years. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).9  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome adjudicative factors deserve further discussion. I have taken into consideration \nApplicant\u2019s young age in 2009 and 2010 and his minimal income and tax liability at that \ntime. Any errors he made then were due to his lack of maturity in dealing with adult \nresponsibilities related to his tax-filing obligations. I have also taken into account his \npersonal situation in the period 2014 to 2017. He had just moved out of his father\u2019s home \nin 2015 and was attending graduate school full-time to improve his employment and \n                                                          \n9 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nincome opportunities. During that period, he worked two part-time, low-paying jobs trying \nto be independent. He had difficulty paying his rent, especially in the summer, when he \nlost the income from his primary job with the public school district. It appears that he could \nnot pay his 2014 taxes in 2015 and that he under withheld on his federal and state taxes \nin 2016 and 2017 due to his lack of sufficient net income to pay for his basic needs. With \nnet incomes from his primary job of $400-$800 per month, he was clearly underemployed \nas a college graduate. His failure to file his federal and state tax returns on time in those \ntwo years, as alleged in the SOR is problematic, but not surprising, again considering his \nage and his likely discovery that he owed taxes in those years that he could not pay.  \n \n \nIn October 2017, Applicant finally obtained employment that gave him sufficient \nhours and pay to begin to act like a responsible adult. He filed his 2017 tax return in \nNovember, which was a little after the automatic extension date, and he owes a modest \namount of taxes. He filed his 2018 federal and state tax returns, as required, with the help \nof a tax professional and owes nothing. Moreover, he has taken a mature approach to \ndealing with his past tax debts dating back to 2014. He has set up an installment payment \nplan with the IRS, and he has paid off his state tax obligations. \n \n \nApplicant presently works in the personnel security environment and is very aware \nof the importance of financial responsibility and why it is important to an evaluation of \none\u2019s security worthiness. Applicant\u2019s character witness, who has known Applicant his \nentire life, testified that he was proud of Applicant\u2019s development and maturity. I respect \nhis opinion, and I am convinced that Applicant will responsibly address his relatively small \nfederal tax debt, as he has with his one delinquent credit-card debt. Applicant lived a \nnumber of years on the edge of financial insecurity and now he has the opportunity to use \nhis educational credentials to work at his first, responsible adult job and earn an income \nworthy of a well-educated adult. He has worked too long and too hard to get to where he \nis today to risk losing everything by acting irresponsibly.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his financial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On July 6, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \ndetailing \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF, \nFinancial \nConsiderations. (Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \neffective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 18, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 5, 2018.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on October 22, \n2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on November 27, 2018.  The \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment offered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered a set of documents, \nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A collectively, which was admitted without objection.  \nApplicant testified on her own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business \non December 3, 2018, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional supporting \ndocumentation.  Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, which was admitted without objection.  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 13, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and is divorced.  She has a high school diploma and an \nAssociates of Arts degree.  She is employed by a defense contractor is as an IT \nSpecialist.  She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her \nemployment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR identified eleven delinquent debts totaling in excess of approximately \n$75,000, which include student loans, credit card debt, and medical bills, among other \nmiscellaneous debt.  Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  Credit reports of the Applicant dated November 19, 2016; \nand May 10, 2018, confirm the debts listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 2 and 3.)  \nApplicant began working for her current employer in October 2018 and she earns \n$52,000 annually.  Before that she worked for another company, temp agencies, and \nhad other miscellaneous job and earned substantially less.   \n \nApplicant testified that she began to have financial problems after she was fired \nin 2014 by her employer.  She explained that she did not get along with the director, \nwho thought she could not do her job.  At that time, Applicant was completely out of \nwork for about ten months.  During that period, she collected unemployment and went \nthrough a training program to become certified for Information Technology (IT).  She \nwas also working for a temp agency, but was still not earning enough to pay her bills.   \n \nIn May 2018, while working for another employer, Applicant encountered a freak \naccident.  While working as an IT Specialist, she grabbed a flat screen monitor that was \nsitting on the desk, and tried to lift it up.  The power plug was jammed behind the desk, \nand Applicant twisted her knee, tore the cartilage, and was unable to walk.  Applicant \nwas off work completely for three or four months.  During that period, she received \nworkers compensation which was only 40 percent of her pay.  While she was off work, \ntrying to heal from the knee injury, she fell on her hand and broke her finger.  As a result \n\n \n3 \n \nof these accidents, she is no longer able to lift more than 25 pounds and cannot bend, \ntwist, squat, or kneel repetitively. \n \n  Applicant believes that her long periods of unemployment and freak accidents \ncaused her to be off work for a total of two and a half years, namely periods in 2014, \n2015, and part of 2017.  During this period of unemployment, she experienced financial \nhardship, and borrowed money from her mother, just to make ends meet, but was still \nunable to pay her delinquent bills.   \n \nIn October 2018, Applicant was hired by her current employer, and since then \nshe has earned a decent income.  When she started working for her current employer, \nshe still had personal debts she paid first that involved money that she borrowed from \nfamily.  Once she paid those debts off, she started working to resolve the debt set forth \nin the SOR.  Applicant also recently reduced her living expenses by moving out of her \napartment and into a house where she is renting a room.  The following delinquent \ndebts set forth in the SOR are discussed below:         \n    \n1.a.  A delinquent student loan debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $65,441.  Applicant stated that she has consolidated her student loans and \nset up a payment plan to resolve her student loan debt.  In November 2018, she started \nmaking payments to resolve the debt in the amount of $200 every two weeks.  (Tr. pp. \n18 - 19.)  At the time of the hearing, she had made one payment. \n \n1.b.  A delinquent credit card debt was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$3,479.  Applicant stated that she has tried to contact that creditor but has not been \nable to set up a payment arrangement yet.  She plans to do so soon.  (Tr. p. 32.)          \n \n1.c.  A delinquent debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $3,186.  Applicant \ntestified that she set up a payment plan with the creditor in November 2018, to pay $50 \nevery two weeks toward the debt.  At the time of the hearing, she had made two \npayments.  (Tr. p. 19 \u2013 20.)           \n \n1.d.  A delinquent debt owed to a bank was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$1,169.  Applicant claims that her niece opened the account in her name.  When \nApplicant confronted her, she blamed it on her friend.  Her niece is incarcerated.  (Tr. \npp. 33 \u2013 34.)          \n \n1.e.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$679.   Applicant contends that this is the same debt that is set forth in SOR allegation \n1.j.  Applicant stated that she set up a payment plan with the creditor of $50 monthly to \nresolve the debt.  Her first payment was on November 15, 2018.  (Tr. p. 21.)      \n \n1.f.  A delinquent medical debt is listed on Applicant\u2019s credit report in the amount of \napproximately $152.  Applicant stated that she set up a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor to pay off the entire amount on the 30th of November 2018.  (Tr. p. 38.)   \n     \n\n \n4 \n \n1.g.  A delinquent cellular debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $33.  \nApplicant stated that this debt is scheduled to be paid in full on the 30th of November \n2018.  (Tr. p. 40.) \n            \n1.h.  A delinquent medical debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$198.  Applicant stated that this debt is scheduled to be paid in full on the 30th of \nNovember 2018.  (Tr. p. 39.)            \n \n1.i.  A delinquent medical debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$198.  Applicant stated that this debt is scheduled to be paid in full on the 30th of \nNovember 2018.  (Tr. p. 39.)     \n \n1.j.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $679.  Applicant contends that this is the same debt set forth in the SOR \nallegation 1.e.  Applicant set up a payment plan in November 2018 with the creditor to \npay $50 monthly toward the debt.  At the time of the hearing, she had made one \npayment and on the 30th of November 2018, she was scheduled to pay another.  (Tr. p. \n21.)        \n \n \n1.k.  A delinquent cellular debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$2,066.  Applicant stated that she started making payments of $200 every two weeks \nwhich started on November 16, 2018.  (Tr. p. 40.)            \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was fired from her job in 2014 and began to have financial problems.  \nUnable to find steady employment, as time passed, her delinquent debts increased.  \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations are \npotentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \n \n  \nArguably, Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when she was fired from her job.  \nThey continued when she was unable to find steady employment, and then aggravated \nby her freak accident this past year that caused her to miss even more work.  In regard \nto Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, at this point, most of them remain owing.  Given her \nsituation, she has not been able to pay much toward her delinquent debts, since she \nonly recently started working again.  She has now been working for about three months \nstraight and during that time she has demonstrated sound judgment and has made a \ndiligent effort to resolve her debts.  However, it is not clear from the record whether she \nis only paying them in order to obtain a security clearance, or whether she would pay \nthem regardless of the situation.  In either case, Applicant remains excessively \nindebted, and has not established a systematic pattern of payment demonstrating that \nshe can and will resolve her delinquent debts.  Based upon these facts, there is \ninsufficient evidence in the record to show that she has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  There remain questions about her current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 24, 2017. \nAfter reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July \n3, 2018, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 19, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \nDOHA assigned the case to me on November 1, 2018. The notice of hearing was \nissued on November 13, 2018, setting the hearing for December 18, 2018. At the \nhearing, the Government offered three exhibits (GE 1 through 3). Applicant testified and \nsubmitted one exhibit post-hearing (AE 1). All exhibits were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 2, 2018. \n03/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the seven SOR financial allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.g). His SOR admissions and those at his hearing are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is 57 years old. He graduated from high school in 1979, and attended a \ncommunity college for a short period, but has completed no additional formal education. \nHe married in 1991 and divorced in 2000. He has two children of this marriage, ages 25 \nand 21. He married his second wife in 2003 and divorced in 2013. He has two children \nof this marriage, ages 12 and 9. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard (Reserve) in \n1983 and was discharged in 1990. He received a general discharge because of drug-\nrelated misconduct. While serving in the Coast Guard, he was granted a secret \nclearance in 1986. \n \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2017 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed he had financial problems that included being delinquent in his child support \nobligations and six delinquent credit cards that were in collection or charged off, all \ndebts totaling about $90,000. He noted that his financial problems resulted from \nextensive periods of unemployment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history shows that he worked for a large company between \n2000 and 2014. The company was relocating to another state, and Applicant elected to \ntake a six-month severance payment instead of relocating. He was unemployed \nbetween April and September 2014. After taking his severance pay, Applicant resided \nwith his then girlfriend at different locations. It is not clear from his testimony the value of \nhis severance pay, and to what extent, if any, he used it to pay his delinquent child \nsupport.  \n \nApplicant was employed during September and October 2014, and unemployed \nbetween October 2014 and April 2015. He was employed between April and August \n2015, and unemployed between August 2015 and May 2016. He was employed with a \nfederal contractor between May and August 2016, and unemployed between \nSeptember 2016 and May 2017. Applicant was hired by his current employer and \nclearance sponsor as a network support engineer in June 2017. He seeks the \ncontinuation of his clearance, which is required for his work with his current employer. \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his periods of unemployment, his \n2013 divorce, and him having to pay half of his monthly income in child support. His \nchild support obligation equates to about 33 percent of whatever his gross income is, \nplus an additional amount to pay arrearages. Applicant\u2019s gross 15-day pay is $3,250. \nThe state garnishes $1,124 in child support. After paying federal and state taxes, social \nsecurity tax, Medicare tax, and health and vision insurance, his net pay is $1,006 every \n15 days \u2013 a little over $2,000 a month. His current employer\u2019s earning statement from \nJuly 2017, shows a $1,124 deduction for child support every pay period.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe state started garnishing Applicant\u2019s pay to satisfy his child support obligation \nin April 2013. He noted that his child support obligation was determined based on his \n2014 earnings, which were $94,000 a year. He has been to the family court at least \nthree times to adjust his child support obligation to his current earning with limited \nsuccess. Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows that his pay was consecutively \ngarnished between April 2013 and February 2017, except during some periods of \nunemployment. During that period, he paid over $59,000 in support.  \n \nApplicant used his credit cards to supplement his income and to pay for his living \nexpenses during his unemployment periods. Additionally, he occasionally sought \nfinancial assistance from his elderly parents to pay his bills or the rent. Because he had \nperiods with little or no income, he was unable to pay his credit cards and they became \ndelinquent. His current credit card debt totals about $64,500. Applicant presented no \ndocumentary evidence of any efforts to pay, settle, or resolve any of the SOR debts.  \n \nConcerning his two older children, Applicant testified that he never had a court-\nordered support obligation. He paid his ex-wife and children whatever he could afford \nevery month, but his support was inconsistent. He acknowledged that he was in arrears \nin his child support payments for his older children, but noted that his ex-wife was \nunderstanding and she did not need support because her family had money. \nConcerning his current financial situation, Applicant testified he is making $78,000 \nyearly. He explained that after paying his child support obligation, the little money he \nhas left over is used to pay his living expenses. He has not participated in any financial \ncounseling, and he presented no evidence to show that he is following a working \nbudget. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his financial problems. He claimed that if he \ncould, he would pay his delinquent accounts, but claimed he cannot pay them because \nof his child support obligation. He likes his current job and would like to continue \nworking with his current employer. He believes this is the best job he has had in a long \ntime. He promised to pay his delinquent accounts if he is granted a clearance to \ncontinue in his position. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He took six months \nof severance pay from his 14-year job and has had difficulty finding a full-time position. \nSince 2014, he has had numerous periods of unemployment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s income was insufficient to pay for his court-ordered child support \nobligations, living expenses, and accumulated debts. He maxed out his credit cards \npaying for his living expenses and other discretionary expenses. He was unable to pay \nhis debts and they became delinquent. He presented no evidence of efforts to pay, \nsettle, or otherwise resolve his delinquent accounts. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.1  \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nNone of the financial considerations mitigating conditions are fully raised by the \nfacts in this case and they do not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because of his periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment \nand \nthe \nresulting \nreduced \nearnings \nmay \nbe \nconsidered \ncircumstances beyond his control. Notwithstanding, his evidence is insufficient to show \nthat he was financially responsible under the circumstances, and it is not clear what \nApplicant did with the six-month severance pay he received in 2014.  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show clear indications that his financial \nproblems are resolved or under control. He presented no evidence of contacts with \ncreditors, payments made, or of good-faith efforts to repay his creditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand (d) are not applicable. Considering the evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to demonstrate financial responsibility, or that his financial problems are \nbeing resolved. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \n                                                                                                                                            \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 57, has been employed with federal contractors intermittently and has \nheld a clearance during some periods of time. His evidence is insufficient to establish a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. Unmitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns lead me to conclude that granting a security clearance to Applicant is not \nwarranted at this time.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. With more effort towards documented resolution of his delinquent debts, a \nhealthy financial picture, and a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, \nhe may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance \nworthiness.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He has a doctorate degree (PhD), which was awarded in 1997. Applicant married in 2013, although he and his spouse have been cohabitating since 1997. He does not have children.1 Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment from about 2008 until he obtained his current job in November 2018. He also developed cognitive problems that made it difficult to work at his previous level. As a consequence, he was unable to pay all his bills. Debts became delinquent and taxes went unpaid.2 Applicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in August 2015. Under Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $24,860 owed on a car loan. Under Schedule E, Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed $4,500 owed to the IRS and $3,000 owed to his state. The petition listed debts totaling $50,237 under Schedule F, Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims. The bankruptcy court allowed claims totaling $15,055 from the IRS and $3,084 from the state.3 The Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was dismissed upon Applicant\u2019s motion in July 2016 because he could not afford to maintain the monthly payments.

He submitted documents that I have marked AE K \nthrough N and admitted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since November 2016. He has a doctorate degree (PhD), which \nwas awarded in 1997. Applicant married in 2013, although he and his spouse have \nbeen cohabitating since 1997. He does not have children.1 \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment from about 2008 \nuntil he obtained his current job in November 2018. He also developed cognitive \nproblems that made it difficult to work at his previous level. As a consequence, he was \nunable to pay all his bills. Debts became delinquent and taxes went unpaid.2 \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in August 2015. \nUnder Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $24,860 owed \non a car loan. Under Schedule E, Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the \npetition listed $4,500 owed to the IRS and $3,000 owed to his state. The petition listed \ndebts totaling $50,237 under Schedule F, Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority \nClaims. The bankruptcy court allowed claims totaling $15,055 from the IRS and $3,084 \nfrom the state.3  \n \n \nThe Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was dismissed upon Applicant\u2019s motion in July \n2016 because he could not afford to maintain the monthly payments. The trustee\u2019s \nreport shows that Applicant paid $10,817 into the plan. Applicant\u2019s attorney was paid \n$3,310; the trustee was paid $678; the IRS was paid $4,954; the state was paid $1,124; \nand $750 was refunded to Applicant.4 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the dismissed Chapter 13 bankruptcy case; a $1,097 state tax \nlien; two unpaid judgments totaling $5,537; and four delinquent debts. However, one of \nthe delinquent debts is the underlying debt that resulted in one of the judgments. The \ntotal amount of the three remaining debts is $25,198. The allegations are established \nthrough credit reports, Applicant\u2019s admissions, and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has managed the family\u2019s finances since before they married. \nApplicant did not have any tax problems before his 2013 marriage. He always had \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 15-19, 32; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-25, 31-32, 44-48; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. at 25, 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-6. The SOR does not specifically allege Applicant\u2019s \nunpaid federal taxes, but I consider the above information to be facts and circumstances surrounding the \nChapter 13 bankruptcy case, which was alleged. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be \nused for disqualification purposes. It may be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s overall financial \nsituation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis. \n \n4 Tr. at 56-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-6. \n\n \n3 \n \nenough withheld from his salary to pay his taxes. His spouse is self-employed. Nothing \nis withheld from Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s paycheck, and he is responsible for paying his \ntaxes throughout the year. Applicant\u2019s spouse did not pay enough in taxes for several \nyears. They filed joint returns, which made Applicant jointly liable for all the taxes owed \nfrom their combined income.5 \n \n \nApplicant has been paying the IRS and his state since 2016. His state reported \nthat he made payments totaling $3,561 between April 2016 and December 2018. The \npayments were applied to taxes owed for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014. He currently \nowes the state $2,757 for tax year 2013 and $3,471 for 2015.6 \n \n \nRecords from the IRS show that Applicant made payments totaling $5,302 \nbetween March 2017 and January 2019. The IRS applied $500 to tax year 2017, the \nrest was applied to tax year 2015. He entered into a $366 per month installment \nagreement with the IRS in July 2018. He has made payments to the IRS every month, \nbut the last three monthly payments were $277, $600, and $250, which totaled more \nthan $366 per month for three months. He currently owes the IRS $4,524 for tax year \n2017.7   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial adviser recommended that he file 2018 tax returns as \n\u201cmarried filing separately.\u201d This will prevent Applicant from assuming his spouse\u2019s tax \nproblems. He increased his federal withholding by $300 per month and his state by $50 \nper month. Any additional refunds generated by the increased withholdings will be \napplied toward his back taxes. He filed a Request for Innocent Spouse Relief petition, \nwhich if approved would alleviate some of his tax problems from previous years. \nApplicant listed on the form that he had cognitive problems.8 \n \n \nApplicant has not paid any of the non-tax judgments and debts alleged in the \nSOR. He felt it was more important to address his taxes first, and then his other debts. \nHe will attempt to settle the debts through lump-sum payments. He has not accrued any \nnew delinquent debts. His financial advisor has assisted him in creating a budget.9 \n \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his honesty, responsibility, work ethic, \nintelligence, diligence, selflessness, generosity of time and spirit, conscientiousness, \nprofessionalism, enthusiasm, dedication, and integrity. His psychiatrist has treated him \nfor ten years. He opined that Applicant\u2019s \u201cjudgment is intact and that he is stable, \nreliable and trustworthy.\u201d10 \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 32, 36-37, 51, 60-61; AE C. \n \n6 Tr. at 39, 43, 50-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C, K, L. \n \n7 Tr. at 39-42; AE H, I, M, N. \n \n8 Tr. at 38-39, 61-63; AE C, D, J. \n \n9 Tr. at 44, 49-56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE E-G. \n \n10 AE A, B. \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid taxes, judgments, \nand delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges the underlying debt that resulted in the judgment alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for \nApplicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment from about 2008 \nuntil he obtained his current job in November 2018. He also developed cognitive \nproblems that made it difficult to work at his previous level. Those conditions were \nbeyond his control. His tax issues, while primarily caused by his spouse\u2019s failure to pay \nhis taxes, were within Applicant\u2019s control, as Applicant permitted his spouse to handle \ntheir family\u2019s finances and file joint returns. By doing so, Applicant accepted \nresponsibility for all the taxes owed as a family unit. \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018).  \n \n \nApplicant is credited with paying the IRS and his state since 2016. However, it \ndoes little good to pay back taxes while not paying the current year\u2019s taxes. He currently \nowes the state $2,757 for tax year 2013 and $3,471 for 2015, and the IRS $4,524 for \ntax year 2017. He is taking steps in the right direction as recommended by his financial \nadviser. He will file 2018 tax returns as \u201cmarried filing separately.\u201d He increased his \nfederal withholding of his pay by $300 per month and his state by $50 per month. He \nfiled a Request for Innocent Spouse Relief petition, which if approved would alleviate \nsome of his tax problems from previous years. He also has a budget and has not \naccrued any new delinquent debts.  \n \n \nApplicant has not paid any of the non-tax judgments and delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. He stated that he is addressing the taxes first, and will then work on \n\n \n7 \n \nhis other debts. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track \nrecord of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-\n14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His \nfinancial problems are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Security concerns arising out of \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s excellent character evidence. The letters describe a \nkind-hearted man who is professionally and personally respected. I found him to be \nhonest and credible. However, Applicant\u2019s tax problems are worse today than what he \nreported on his 2015 bankruptcy petition wherein he listed that he and his spouse owed \n$4,500 to the IRS and $3,000 to his state. He currently owes the IRS $4,524 for tax year \n2017, and the state $2,757 for tax year 2013 and $3,471 for 2015. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 4, 2017. On November 26, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent \nhim a Statement of Reasons (SOR), citing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. \nDOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); DOD Manual \n5200.02, Procedures for the DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP), (April 3, 2017) \n(Manual), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all \nadjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nThe Manual cancelled and incorporated DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987) (Regulation). The Manual covers sensitive positions, \nbut it does not include the specific provisions for ADP cases that were set out in the \nRegulation. ADP cases continue to be adjudicated in accordance with the Deputy Under \n\n2 \n \nSecretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum for the Director, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 24, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n30, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on April 23, 2019. DOHA sent Applicant a \nnotice of hearing on May 8, 2019, scheduling the hearing for June 11, 2019. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any \nother witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. At the end of the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding SOR \u00b6 1.q, alleging multiple \nfailures to timely file federal and state income tax returns. I granted the motion, without \nobjection from Applicant, and I kept the record open until July 17, 2019, to enable him to \nsubmit documentary evidence regarding SOR \u00b6 1.q as well as the other allegations. He \ndid not submit anything further. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old customer-service supervisor employed by a federal \ncontractor since May 2017. He was employed in the private sector until he quit his job in \nDecember 2016. He was unemployed until he was hired by his current employer. He \nhas never held a security clearance or eligibility for a public trust position. \n \n \nApplicant married in December 1994 and divorced in March 2002. He married his \ncurrent spouse in October 2012. He has three children, ages 24, 14, and 11. The two \nolder children live with him. He pays child support for the 11-year-old, who is from \nanother relationship and lives with her mother. (Tr. 21.) He attended college from May \n2013 to August 2016 but did not receive a degree. \n \n \nApplicant earns about $59,000 per year. His wife is a corporate vice-president \nand earns about $175,000 per year. (Tr. 22-23.) Applicant has a retirement account of \nabout $50,000 and his wife has a retirement account of about $100,000. \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in his e-QIP that a federal tax lien was imposed against him \nin January 2004, and that he had retained a lawyer to resolve it. (GX 1 at 35.) When he \nwas interviewed by a security investigator in December 2017, he told the investigator \nthat he was notified in 2010 that a federal tax lien had been filed against him for about \n$130,000 and that the lien had not been satisfied. (GX 3 at 10.) \n \nWhen Applicant responded to DOHA financial interrogatories in September 2018, \nhe disclosed that he had failed to file his federal and state income tax returns on time for \ntax years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He repeated this disclosure at \nthe hearing. (Tr. 43.) He testified that he believed he was not required to file returns for \nyears when he did not owe any taxes. (Tr. 45-47.) \n \nIn his September 2018 responses to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant also \ndisclosed that he owed federal and state taxes for 2000 through 2004 and 2010. (GX 2 \n\n3 \n \nat 2.) He testified that he owes about $40,000 in \u201creal money,\u201d but that the amount of \nthe debt has increased because of penalties and interest. (Tr. 28.) Because he moved \nfrequently, he was not aware of his tax debt until 2010. (Tr. 29.) He testified that he \nhired a tax preparer to file his tax returns for 2000 through 2004, but the returns were \nnever filed. When he found out about his tax debt in 2010, he encountered difficulty \nobtaining the documentation he needed to file the returns for 2000-2004 because of the \nlapse of time. (Tr. 34.)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in September 2018, he \nincluded an IRS account transcript reflecting that he owed $761.76 for tax year 2010. \n(GX 2 at 9.) This tax debt was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which he denied in his answer to \nthe SOR. At the hearing, he was unsure whether the debt had been paid. (Tr. 50.) \nAlthough I kept the record open to enable him to provide documentary evidence, he did \nnot provide any further information about this debt. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he entered into a payment agreement with the IRS around \n2011 and was making monthly $300 payments until he hired a tax-relief company in \n2013, and the company advised him to stop making payments so that they could \nnegotiate a settlement with the IRS. He testified that he paid the tax-relief company \n$2,500. He provided no documentary evidence of his contract with the tax-relief \ncompany. As of the date of the hearing, he had made no payments to the IRS and the \ntax debt was not resolved. He testified that he received a letter from the IRS in 2018 \nstating that the balance due was about $42,000. (Tr. 35-87.) He did not submit a copy of \nthe letter. \n \nWhen Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in September and \nNovember 2018, he stated that he had obtained extensions of time to file his federal \nreturns for 2015, 2016, and 2017, and that all returns had been filed. (GX 2 at 2; GX 3 \nat 3.) He submitted IRS account transcripts for tax years 2008 through 2014. The \ntranscripts reflect that the return for 2008 was filed in July 2011, the returns for 2009 \nand 2010 were filed in May 2011, the return for 2011 was filed in May 2012, the return \nfor 2013 was filed in March 2015 (after he received an extension until October 2014), \nand the return for 2014 was filed in August 2015. (GX 2 at 5-12.)  \n \n \nA credit report from October 2018 reflected 12 delinquent medical debts, alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.o. All the debts were related to a period of hospitalization when \nApplicant did not have medical insurance. He submitted an application for relief from the \nout-of-pocket expenses, but it was denied because his and his wife\u2019s income were too \nhigh to qualify for relief. (Tr. 55.)  \n \nFour debts, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g, are for the same amount ($259) and \nreflected in the same credit report. The specific creditor is not alleged. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR and at the hearing, he asserted that the four are duplicates of the \nsame debt. He testified that he contacted the hospital in early 2018 and was informed \nthat the four debts were duplicates. (Tr. 54.) He testified that the hospital sent him an \nupdated bill in October 2018, removing the duplicate debts. (Tr. 56.) He did not submit a \ncopy of the updated bill.  \n\n4 \n \nApplicant denied the $70 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, which is reflected in \nthe October 2018 credit report. (GX 4 at 2.) He submitted no evidence showing the \nbasis for his denial and no evidence that he disputed the debt with the creditor, the \ncollection agency, or the credit bureau. He admitted all the other medical debts and \nstated that he was working with the creditors to resolve them. He testified that he began \nmaking monthly $25 payments to the hospital in April 2018 and had continued making \npayments up to the date of the hearing. (Tr. 58.) He did not submit any documentary \nevidence of payments. \n \n \nThe October 2018 credit report also reflects a child-support arrearage of $273, \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. Applicant testified that the arrearage arose when he initially \ndenied that he was the father of a child but was later determined to be the father. By the \ntime that paternity was determined, his liability for six or seven months of child-support \nhad accrued. (GX 3 at 11.) He testified that he had paid the arrearage and is currently \npaying $495 per month by automatic deduction from his pay. (Tr. 62-63.) The October \n2018 credit report reflects that his scheduled payments are $495 per month, that his last \npayment was in September 2018, that the balance due was $768, and that the account \nwas past due for $273. (GX 4 at 3.) Applicant did not submit any documentation \nshowing that the arrearage was satisfied or that payments were being made by \nautomatic payroll deduction. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he and his wife have been working with an accountant for \nseven or eight months to improve their financial management. (Tr. 67-68.) He provided \nno evidence of specific steps he had taken to improve his financial management. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the Manual and the adjudicative \nguidelines for assignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.   \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \n\n5 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for a public trust position.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges an unsatisfied federal tax lien entered in June 2012 for $484 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), an unsatisfied federal tax lien entered in May 2010 for $132,736 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b), and a federal tax debt for $761.76 for tax year 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It also alleges 12 \nmedical debts totaling about $24,639 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.o) and a delinquent child-support \ndebt for $273 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). Finally, the SOR as amended alleges failure to timely file \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2002 through 2004, 2013, and 2017 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.q).  \n \n \nApplicant asserted that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g were duplicates, but \nhe did not submit any documentary evidence reflecting that they were duplicates or that \nthe hospital readjusted his bill to reflect the duplication. However, the fact that all four \ndebts are for the identical amount to an unidentified medical provider during the same \nperiod of hospitalization lends credence to his claim that the debts are duplicative. \nWhen the same conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). \nAccordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g in Applicant\u2019s favor on that basis. \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n\n6 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible \nmay also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding \nclassified or sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e and 1.i through 1.p and the \nfailures to timely file federal and state tax returns alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q. The following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline are raised by the evidence: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n\n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The failure of Applicant\u2019s tax preparer to file \nhis federal and state income tax returns for 2000 through 2004 and Applicant\u2019s \nuninsured medical expenses were conditions largely beyond his control. However, he \nhas not acted responsibly. He failed to monitor the performance of his tax preparer for \nthe 2000-2004 returns, and he is unfamiliar with the plan and performance of his tax-\nrelief company regarding his current tax debt. He presented no evidence of any actions \nby his tax-relief company to resolve his tax debt since he hired it in 2013. He provided \nno evidence to support his assertion that he is making regular payments on his medical \ndebts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s tax-relief company does not provide the \ntype of financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating condition. It is not clear what \nassistance Applicant is receiving from his accountant, and he has not yet developed a \nfinancial plan. He has not provided evidence that his tax debt, medical debts, and child-\nsupport obligations are under control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant provided no documentary evidence to \nsupport his assertions that his child-support obligations are current and that he is \nmaking regular payments on his medical debts. He admitted at the hearing that he has \nnot made any payments on his tax debt since 2013. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant has filed his past-due income tax \nreturns, but he has not made any payments or negotiated any payment agreement for \nhis tax debt. His eventual compliance with his obligation to file tax returns does not end \nthe inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is \nan evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The fact that \nApplicant has filed his past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of \nApplicant\u2019s security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). He has known \nabout his tax debt since 2010. He has passively relied on a tax-relief company to \nresolve it, and he has made no progress in resolving it since he stopped making \npayments in 2013.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n8 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness \nconcerns raised by his failures to timely file and pay his federal and state tax returns \nand his failures to act responsibly regarding the other debts alleged in the SOR. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant him eligibility for a public trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e and 1.i-1.q: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 19, 2017. \nOn June 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines\n(December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017.\nApplicant answered the SOR on August 31, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 1, 2018, \nand the case was assigned to me on November 15, 2018. On December 21, 2018, the \n03/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for February 7, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and \noffered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through I, which were admitted without objection. I \nkept the record open until February 28, 2019, to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. He timely submitted AX J through N, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 21, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. \nHe denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old cyber-risk consultant employed by a federal contractor \nsince December 2015. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2007 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in May 2011. He has worked for federal contractors since August 2011. He was \ncleared for a public trust position in December 2011. He has never married and has no \nchildren. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts reflected in a credit report from February \n2018. (GX 2.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b: two student loans from same lender for $12,606 and \n$5,701, both charged off in September 2013.  In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and in \nhis testimony at the hearing, he stated that he decided to stop making payments on these \nloans, because the lender had not explained why the balances were not decreasing even \nthough he was making regular payments. He submitted a payment history dated August \n6, 2018, reflecting electronic payments from October 2012 through April 2013. Most of \nthe amounts paid were applied to interest, with only a small amount applied to principal. \n(AX A.) He did not consult with a legal or financial professional before he stopped making \npayments. (Tr. 28.)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that, as of the date of the hearing, he had not \nmade any payments on the debts since April 2013. He hoped to negotiate a \u201csubstantial \npayoff\u201d in return for the lender\u2019s agreement to forgive some of the debt. (Tr. 16.)  \n \nOn February 28, 2019, the date the record closed, Applicant and the lender agreed \nto settle the alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $2,280. (AX J.) He submitted no evidence that he \nhad paid the agreed amount. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is unresolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: delinquent credit-card account placed for collection of $2,088 in \nDecember 2017. Applicant testified that he missed two payments on this account \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nbecause a roommate who was sharing the rent payments on an apartment unexpectedly \nmoved out in 2014, causing him to deplete most of his savings to pay the rent. (Tr. 31-\n32.) . Applicant does not have a payment agreement for this debt, but he has been making \nmonthly payments of between $20 and $50 since November 2017. (AX B; AX J.) He has \nreduced the balance due to $1,799. (AX M.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e: student loan past due for $3,724, with a balance of \n$106,683; and student loan past due for $2,401, with a balance of $68,799. The \nFebruary 2018 credit report reflected both debts as more than 120 days past due as of \nDecember 2017. (GX 2 at 6.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided evidence that \nthe two loans had been consolidated in April 2018 and were in forbearance at that time. \n(AX C.) He made no payments between 2014 and the date of the hearing. He is scheduled \nto begin making payments of about $500 per month on these loans in April 2019. (Tr. 18, \n35-37.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: unpaid rent placed for collection of $1,642. Applicant denied owing \nthis debt, and he submitted evidence from the property manager showing that the debt \nhad been satisfied and was erroneously referred for collection. (AX D; Tr. 20-21.)  \n \n \nFor the past two years, Applicant has earned about $81,000 per year. In his first \njob after graduate school, he earned $56,000 per year, which increased to $62,000 by \nthe time he left this job in June 2014. He earned $70,000 per year from June 2014 to \nDecember 2015. He started his current job at $80,000 per year in December 2015, and \nhe has earned $81,000 for the past two years. (Tr. 24-25.) He has a net monthly \nremainder, after paying living expenses and the credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, of \nabout $2,102. (AX E at 10.) He had $7,125 in his retirement account as of June 2018, \nwith an outstanding loan of $1,642. (AX E at 4.) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, he disclosed foreign vacation travel in May 2013, May and \nNovember 2015, April and May 2016, October 2016, June 2017, and May and June 2017. \nHe testified that this travel was for low-cost vacations. He estimated that his out-of- pocket \nexpenses for each trip were between $500 and $1,100. (Tr. 51.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s close friend, who has known him for about ten years, submitted a letter \ndescribing Applicant\u2019s community service. He describes Applicant as \u201ca fine man of \nimmense integrity, among an abundance of other positive attributes.\u201d (AX I at 1.) A co-\nworker was impressed by Applicant\u2019s ability to organize work, delegate tasks, \ncommunicate with senior leadership, and create comradery among workers of various \ncompetencies and skill levels. This co-worker considers Applicant trustworthy, sincere, \nand diligent. (AX I at 2.) Another co-worker and a former roommate described Applicant\u2019s \ncommunity service and dedication to his job. (AX I at 3.) Applicant\u2019s former mentor at \nwork was impressed with his positive attitude and desire to learn new skills. He believes \nthat Applicant has the initiative and moral judgment required to work as a federal \ncontractor. (AX I at 4.) A former supervisor describes Applicant as highly intelligent, \nmotivated, and trustworthy. (AX I at 5.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that his \n\n \n4 \n \nperformance evaluations have been generally positive, but he did not submit copies of \nany written evaluations. (Tr. 14.) \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant attributed his financial history to immaturity. He believes \nthat he has matured and learned from his mistakes after being in the workforce for eight \nyears. (Tr. 23.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n \n5 \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but not for the other \ndebts alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s unexpected loss of a co-tenant for his apartment in \n2014 was a condition beyond his control. He acted responsibly by negotiating a solution \nwith his landlord, and the SOR does not allege a debt for past-due rent. He claimed that \nthe increased rent expense made him unable to afford the payments on the credit-card \naccount in SOR \u00b6 1.c, on which he has been making payments since at least November \n2017. He has not submitted evidence of conditions beyond his control for the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. It is not \nestablished for the other debts alleged in the SOR, on which he has made no payments. \nEven though Applicant has been steadily employed since graduating from college, he has \nnot made debt payment a high priority. Instead, he has used discretionary funds for \nmultiple overseas vacations. He took no actions to resolve the delinquent debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b until he received the SOR and realized that the debts were an impediment \nto obtaining a security clearance. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by \npayment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicants \nwho begin to address their security-significant conduct only when their personal interests \nare at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. See ISCR Case No. 16-01211 \n(App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Applicant has not \ndisputed any of the other debts alleged in the SOR. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant is alleged under Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 3.a) to have been arrested in November 2017 and charged with simple possession of marijuana, driving under the influence (DUI), and possession of drug paraphernalia on a U.S. military base.

When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted the illegal drug use as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the arrest and charges as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but he denied that the conduct raised personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns. He also denied that he intentionally misrepresented his criminal conduct during his subject interviews on February 21, 2018, and March 28, 2018.

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n05/09/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana in November 2017, in disregard of his clearance \nrequirements and federal law, and his arrest on drunk driving and drug charges while \nentering a military base are not yet adequately mitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse), Guideline E (personal \nconduct), and Guideline J (criminal conduct), which explained why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility \nfor him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective June 8, 2017, to all adjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. \n \n\n2 \n \nOn August 2, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). Department Counsel indicated that the Government was ready to proceed to a \nhearing on March 12, 2019. The case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and on March 18, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for April 10, \n2019. \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) and one Applicant exhibit (AE \nA) were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received \non April 30, 2019. I held the record open for two weeks after his hearing for additional \nevidentiary submissions from Applicant. Nothing was received by the April 30, 2019 \ndeadline, and so I closed the record on that date. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is alleged under Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and cross-alleged under \nGuideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a) to have used marijuana in at least November 2017 after he had \nbeen granted a DOD secret security clearance in July 2006. Applicant is alleged under \nGuideline H (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and Guideline J \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a) to have been arrested in November 2017 and charged with simple possession \nof marijuana, driving under the influence (DUI), and possession of drug paraphernalia on a \nU.S. military base. Also under Guideline E, Applicant allegedly \u201cfailed to outline the full \nextent\u201d of his November 2017 criminal conduct when he was interviewed by an authorized \ninvestigator on February 21, 2018, and March 28, 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted the illegal drug use as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the arrest and charges as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but he denied \nthat the conduct raised personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns. He also \ndenied that he intentionally misrepresented his criminal conduct during his subject \ninterviews on February 21, 2018, and March 28, 2018.  \n \n \nAfter considering his response to the SOR, the exhibits, and the hearing transcript, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old high school graduate. He and his spouse began \ncohabiting in July 2014 and married in May 2017. Applicant has a 15-year-old son from a \nprevious relationship. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor since July 2006 and \nhas held a secret clearance throughout his employment. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 26.) \n \n \nTo renew his security clearance eligibility, Applicant completed and certified to the \naccuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May 2, 2016. Then \nan operations supervisor with his employer, Applicant disclosed a trip to the Caribbean in \nFebruary 2016, but no issues of any significant security concern. (GE 1.) \n \n\n3 \n \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant began experiencing physical symptoms that were \nmedically attributed to excessive anxiety. He was prescribed an anti-anxiety medication, \nbut he did not like its affects so he stopped using it. He continued to experience anxiety, \nand his father suggested that he try marijuana. Applicant accepted an offer of marijuana \n\u201cagainst better judgment.\u201d (Tr. 43.) His father gave him some marijuana, a grinder, and a \nglass pipe.1 Applicant used the marijuana on at least one occasion, which he indicates \noccurred in early November 2017. He smoked it alone in his yard at home. He claims he \ndid not like the way marijuana made him feel, but he did not discard the drug or \nparaphernalia. He stored the marijuana and paraphernalia in the center console of his \ntruck. (Tr. 23-24, 28-31.) Applicant denies any other use of marijuana beyond that single \noccasion, and any intention to use marijuana in the future. (GE 3; Tr. 29, 31-32.) Applicant \nunderstood at the time that any marijuana involvement is illegal under federal law. (Tr. 32, \n43.) \n \n \nOn November 17, 2017, Applicant drank excessively while socializing with friends \nafter work. His route home passed a military base, and he \u201cunwittingly, unknowingly\u201d \nfollowed the vehicle in front of him onto the military base. He had a pass that allowed him \naccess for his work, but he had no reason to access the base at that time. Gate personnel \nsuspected that he had been drinking and asked him to pull over. He apparently failed a \nfield sobriety test and his blood alcohol level tested at .168% and .163%. Applicant was \narrested for DUI and his vehicle was searched. Marijuana and a glass pipe with marijuana \nwere found in his vehicle. (GE 3; Tr. 24.) He was released to his spouse\u2019s custody, and \nclaims to have known only about a DUI charge at the time. (Tr. 33-34.) He was issued a \nviolation statement that he asserts \u201clooked like a speeding ticket and it was barely legible.\u201d \n(Tr. 34.) Applicant was charged with violating state and federal laws for DUI and \npossession of drug paraphernalia (glass pipe and marijuana grinder), and violating federal \nlaw for simple possession of marijuana. (GE 3.) In late February 2018 or early March 2018, \nApplicant was notified of a court date, which is when he submits he learned about the \nmarijuana possession and drug paraphernalia charges. (Tr. 34-35.) On March 27, 2018, \nprosecution in U.S. District Court was deferred pending the establishment of a satisfactory \npretrial diversion program for Applicant. Should no pretrial program be devised, or \nApplicant reject the program or fail to comply with the program, the prosecution would \npursue the charges against him in court. The prosecution agreed to move for a dismissal of \nthe pending charges should Applicant successfully complete the program devised with no \nadmission of guilt by Applicant. (GEs 2-3.) As of April 2019, Applicant had been \ninterviewed by a probation officer, and his house had been inspected, but he had yet to be \noffered a diversion program. (Tr. 25, 36-37, 44-45.) \n \n \nOn February 21, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked whether he had ever been \ncharged with an alcohol-related offense, Applicant responded negatively. After being \nconfronted about an underage drinking incident in March 2000, Applicant admitted the \nincident and that he was placed on six months of probation and ordered to attend alcohol \n                                                 \n1 When asked whether his father is a marijuana user, Applicant responded, \u201capparently.\u201d (Tr. 42.) He denied \nknowing before his father provided him the drug that his father had any marijuana in his possession. (Tr. 42-\n43.)  \n\n4 \n \neducation classes. Applicant then volunteered that he had been cited for DUI by the \nmilitary police in November 2017. He stated that he had two beers while out drinking with \nfriends, and that in route home, he entered the base erroneously due to road construction. \nMilitary police had him pull over because he did not have his identification ready. He \nrecalled performing field sobriety tests but claimed to have no recall how well he did. \nApplicant acknowledged that he had taken a breathalyzer test at the police station, \nalthough he denied any recall of the results. He admitted receiving a citation for DUI, which \nhe now asserts was \u201cbarely legible\u201d (Tr. 21), and that he had received notification in \nDecember 2017 that his driving privileges on the base were suspended. He indicated that \nhe made a mistake and that he no longer went out drinking with friends. (GE 2.) \n \n \nOn March 28, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator to follow-\nup about developed information that he had been arrested for simple possession of \nmarijuana, which he had not previously disclosed. When read the police record inquiry \nconcerning whether he had been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in \na criminal proceeding against him in the last seven years, Applicant volunteered that he \nhad disclosed during his previous subject interview that he had been arrested for DUI. \nThen asked whether there were any other charges, Applicant volunteered that he had been \ncharged with simple possession of marijuana. Concerning why this charge had not been \npreviously disclosed, Applicant explained that he did not remember the charge until he \nreceived a notice to appear in court and that notice was received after his first interview. \nWhen asked for an explanation of the circumstances of his arrest, Applicant asserted that \nhis attorney advised him not to discuss the case while disposition is pending. (GE 2.) \n \n \nThe DOD CAF sent Applicant drug interrogatories on April 26, 2018, and he \nresponded on May 25, 2018. In response to the final disposition of the charges, Applicant \nprovided the court records showing that he had agreed to a deferral of prosecution and \nparticipation in a pre-trial diversion program. Upon completion, the charges against him will \nbe dismissed. In answer to whether he had ever illegally used any controlled substance, \nApplicant stated, \u201cI am embarrassed and ashamed to admit to the use of marijuana. I only \nused once on or around the first week in November 2017.\u201d Applicant denied that he was \ncurrently using any controlled substance or that he associates with persons who use illegal \nsubstances or frequent places were marijuana is being used. He took the opportunity to \nadd the following information: \n \nWhen I initially filed my 10 year red badge paperwork in 2016 all of my \nanswers were truthful. However I was to [sic] embarrassed to admit the truth \nwhen asked these questions by inspector [name omitted]. I made a mistake \nthat will never happen again. I love my Country and my job and hope the \nmistakes that I\u2019ve made will not jeopardize my ability to hold a clearance. \n(GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that in February 2018 that he and the investigator went through \nhis answers to the questions on the SF 86, and that he answered \u201cto the best of [his] \nknowledge.\u201d (Tr. 21.) He later admitted there were some discrepancies in some of the \nstatements that he had made because he was embarrassed. (Tr. 24.) He maintained that \n\n5 \n \nhe did not know about the drug charges before his February 27, 2018 interview, however. \n(Tr. 33-34, 39.) He knew about the drug charges when he retained legal counsel on March \n23, 2018. (Tr. 41.) When asked about his statement during his February interview that he \nhad consumed two beers before his arrest, Applicant responded, \u201cI thought when I made \nthat statement that that was accurate when I said it.\u201d As to his current understanding, \nApplicant expressed uncertainty as to its accuracy based on his blood alcohol content. He \nadmitted that he could have \u201cpotentially\u201d had more to drink. (Tr. 27-28.) He acknowledged \nthat he had not told the OPM investigator that he had used marijuana because he was \nembarrassed. (Tr. 40.) Applicant admitted that he still battles with anxiety. (Tr. 23.) He \nprovided no information about whether he had found a viable alternative to marijuana to \naddress his condition. \n \n \nA co-worker of Applicant\u2019s for the past 15 years has interacted with Applicant both in \nsubordinate and supervisory roles. For the past six months, Applicant has worked for him \nin managing training for their department. Applicant has been innovative and current on \nways to develop and educate employees. He has proven himself to be \u201cprofessional, \nhelpful, dedicated, extremely experienced, and a key resource\u201d to their department and \nemployer. (AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n\n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant used marijuana on one occasion during the \nfirst week of November 2017. Despite his claims that he did not like the drug\u2019s effect on \nhim, he stored some marijuana in his truck along with some drug paraphernalia (a grinder \nand a glass pipe) until November 17, 2018, when his vehicle was searched by military \npolice incident to his DUI arrest. Applicant held a secret clearance when he used marijuana \nand possessed the marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), \u201cany substance misuse (see above definition);\u201d 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a \ncontrolled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while \ngranted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position,\u201d apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance misuse \n\u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant submits that he used marijuana only one \n\n7 \n \ntime. His ongoing possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia suggests that he may \nhave intended to use marijuana again, but there is no evidence that he used it more than \nonce or that he currently has any marijuana in his possession. Even so, Applicant\u2019s \npossession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in violation of federal law and security \nclearance requirements for at least two weeks in November 2017 cannot reasonably be \ncharacterized as isolated, although it was infrequent in that it was limited to November \n2017. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) provides for mitigation when an individual acknowledges his or her drug \ninvolvement and has no intention of future drug activity: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant obtained his marijuana and drug paraphernalia from his father, who \napparently never used marijuana in Applicant\u2019s presence. Yet, AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) is difficult to \nsatisfy without persuasive evidence that Applicant\u2019s father is no longer involved with illegal \ndrugs. AG \u00b6 26(b)(2) does not apply because Applicant used marijuana in his own yard. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), Applicant indicated in response to DOD CAF interrogatories in \nMay 2018, and at his hearing in April 2019, that he does not intend to use any marijuana in \nthe future. His statement in that regard does not include an acknowledgement of \nrevocation of any security clearance eligibility for any violation, but he clearly understands \nthe consequences for any future illegal drug use. At the same time, his credibility is \nsomewhat suspect for the reasons noted under Guideline E, and drug charges are still \npending resolution. In that regard, Applicant would likely face prosecution in the event of \nany illegal drug involvement. He lacks a track record of abstinence without a threat of \ncriminal prosecution. He used marijuana to self-medicate for anxiety. As of April 2019, he \nwas still battling with anxiety. With no evidence that he has a viable alternative in place to \ndeal with his anxiety, the risk of future marijuana use cannot be ruled out. The drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not yet mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \n\n8 \n \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. The following will normally result in an unfavorable \nnational security eligibility determination, security clearance action, or \ncancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate with \nsecurity processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in connection \nwith a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe Government also established a case for disqualification under the personal \nconduct guideline because of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement while possessing a DOD \nsecret clearance, and because of his arrest on a military base on DUI and drug charges \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a). The Appeal Board has held that security-related conduct can be considered \nunder more than one guideline, and in an appropriate case, be given independent weight \nunder each. See ISCR Case No. 11-06672 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2012). Separate from the risk \nof physiological impairment associated with the use of a mood-altering substance, which is \na Guideline H concern, Applicant had an obligation as a defense-contractor employee with \na clearance to comply with federal law and DOD policy prohibiting illegal drug use. \nApplicant exercised \u201cquestionable judgment\u201d within the general security concerns set forth \nin AG \u00b6 15 in several aspects. He used marijuana in knowing violation of federal law and of \nthe obligations of his security clearance. He operated a vehicle while intoxicated, as \nevidenced by his blood alcohol level exceeding .16%. He drove onto federal property drunk \nand with marijuana and drug paraphernalia in his possession. \n \nApplicant\u2019s drunk driving and illegal drug involvement, when viewed together, raise \nconsiderable judgment concerns and reflect an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, as contemplated in disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(c), which provides: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \n \nThe Government alleged a separate basis for disqualification based on Applicant\u2019s \nfailure \u201cto outline the full extent\u201d of his criminal conduct in November 2017 during his \n\n9 \n \nsubject interviews. The evidence shows that Applicant was asked during his February 2018 \ninterview whether he had been charged with an alcohol-related offense, and he responded \nnegatively. He later volunteered that he had been charged with DUI on a military base in \nNovember 2017, but only after he was confronted by the investigator about his underage \npossession of alcohol offense in 2000. Applicant told the investigator that he had \nconsumed only two beers before his DUI, and he did not inform the investigator about the \ndrug charges. When re-interviewed in March 2018, one day after his court appearance on \nthe November 2017 charges, he initially disclosed only the DUI. He had to be asked about \nany additional offenses before he disclosed that he had also been charged with simple \npossession of marijuana. He claimed he had not recalled the drug charges during his prior \ninterview.  He then refused to detail the circumstances, claiming that his attorney told him \nnot to discuss the charges because they were still pending. It is noted that Applicant did not \nreveal that he had ever used any marijuana during either interview with the investigator. In \nresponse to DOD CAF drug interrogatories, Applicant admitted that he was \u201cto [sic] \nembarrassed to tell the truth when asked those questions\u201d by the OPM investigator. \n \nApplicant now claims that he was unaware of the drug charges before he was \nnotified of his court appearance sometime after his February 2018 interview. Even if true, \nhe has admitted that he concealed his marijuana use from the investigator during both \ninterviews. The evidence proves initial concealment of his DUI, minimization of his alcohol \nconsumption, and lack of candor about his drug involvement to the OPM investigator. \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(b) applies, as follows: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \n \n \nMoreover, there is a basis to apply AG \u00b6 15(b) concerning refusal to provide full, \nfrank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators. Applicant would not discuss \nthe circumstances of his November 2017 arrest when asked to do so during his March 28, \n2018 interview with the OPM investigator. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s unwillingness to be fully forthcoming during his subject interviews \nprecludes favorable consideration of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made \nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts.\u201d His refusal to discuss his arrest during his March 2018 interview \nwarrants some consideration of AG \u00b6 17(b) if he acted in good faith on the advice of his \nattorney. AG \u00b6 17(b) states: \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a personal with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being aware of the \n\n10 \n \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully. \n \nApplicant presented no corroboration from his attorney that he had been advised not \nto discuss his arrest with government investigators. Moreover, AG \u00b6 17(b) would not \nmitigate his February 2018 misrepresentations and omissions because Applicant did not \nretain the attorney until March 2018. \n \nMisrepresentations of relevant and material facts concerning issues that could \npotentially impact the security investigation and adjudication process are considered \nserious. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and his arrest were recent as of his interviews. While his \nuse of marijuana was infrequent, it is aggravated because he held a security clearance, \nand he knowingly disregarded federal law. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. It provides: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) has some applicability in that his marijuana use and DUI were \ninfrequent. AG \u00b6 17(d) states: \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nApplicant acknowledges that he made a serious mistake by using marijuana and \ndriving drunk. There is no evidence that he is currently using marijuana or that he drives \nafter drinking alcohol. He reportedly used marijuana to self-medicate for his anxiety. He is \nstill battling with anxiety, but there is no clear indication of a viable treatment option that \nwould make relapse unlikely. He showed a lack of reform when he testified at his hearing \nthat he answered the questions of the investigator to the best of his knowledge. When \nconfronted about his interview account that he had consumed only two beers before his \narrest for DUI, he testified that he believed his statement was accurate at the time. By the \ntime of his February interview, he had time to reflect on his arrest, including on \nbreathalyzer results of .168% and .163%. When confronted with that obvious indication of \nintoxication, he admitted that he \u201cpotentially\u201d had consumed more than two beers. \nApplicant has yet to show that his representations are completely reliable. The personal \nconduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 30: \n \n\n11 \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest on DUI, marijuana possession, and drug paraphernalia \npossession charges establishes disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(b), which states: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, persecuted, or convicted. \n \nProsecution of the November 2017 criminal charges is currently deferred, but the \nfacts show that Applicant operated his truck onto a U.S. military base with a blood alcohol \nlevel more than adequate to prove that he was intoxicated. Marijuana and drug \nparaphernalia were found in his truck, and Applicant admits that he kept marijuana and \ndrug paraphernalia in his center console. His case is pending an appropriate pre-trial \ndiversion program, which is not the equivalent of probation that would trigger AG \u00b6 31(c), \n\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d At the same time, it would be premature to \napply either AG \u00b6 32(a) or AG \u00b6 32(d) in mitigation when there has been no resolution to \nthe criminal charges. Those mitigating conditions provide: \n \n(a) so much time  has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n \nApplicant has a good employment record. However, it would be premature at \nthis time to conclude that the criminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).2 By using marijuana in knowing disregard of federal law,  Applicant cast serious doubt \n                                                 \n2 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \n\n12 \n \nabout whether he can be counted on to comply with the requirements for handling \nclassified information. \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for past \ntransgressions. Yet it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The \nGovernment must be able to rely on those persons granted security clearance eligibility to \nfulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies, and without regard \nto their personal interests. For the reasons discussed, Applicant has raised enough doubt \nin that regard to where I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue his eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines recognize the complexities of human behavior, and are applied \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period \nand a careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an \naffirmative determination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;   \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \n            tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as  \n            required.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file TY 2014 - 2016 federal income tax returns and \nthe delinquent taxes alleged in the SOR are confirmed by her credit reports and answer \nto the SOR. The Government produced substantial evidence to support the disqualifying \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), 19(c), and 19(f), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.3 Applicant has \npartially met that burden.   \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.   \n \n \nApplicant earned modest AGI for the relevant TYs. Yet, she met the threshold \nincome requiring that she file income tax returns. She offered no explanation or \nevidence why she could not file, even if she was unable to afford the resulting taxes. \nAlthough she produced cancelled checks and tax transcripts indicating that she filed the \nincome tax returns in June and July of 2018, and she has paid all delinquent taxes, this \nwas too little, too late. She has produced no relevant or responsive documentation \neither with her Answer to the SOR, or in response to the FORM, except for the \ncancelled checks made out to the U.S. Treasury Department and state department of \nrevenue. She has not demonstrated that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant has the burden to provide sufficient evidence to show that her \nfinancial problems are under control, and that her debts were incurred under \ncircumstances making them unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. She admitted her failure to timely file \nthe federal income tax returns for three years (2014-2016). Applicant did not provide \nenough details with documentary corroboration about her financial state and stressors \naround 2014 \u2013 2016. The basis for her fear that she could not afford to pay income \ntaxes, if she filed income tax returns as required, cannot be discerned from the record \nevidence.  \n \n                                                          \n3 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAside from Applicant\u2019s tardy payment of overdue taxes, there is no documentary \nevidence that Applicant was unable to file income tax returns and pay her taxes when \nthey were due. She did not describe financial counseling or provide her budget. The \nrecord lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed explanations of \nthe causes for her financial problems and other mitigating information.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant did not explain her failure to \ntimely file federal income tax returns.  She has been employed most of her adult life, \nMost importantly, she has not addressed the specific allegations in the SOR. She has \nnot met her burden of production. To her credit, she paid the past-due taxes alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, but that is only part of her problem. It is unclear why these income \ntaxes became past due in the first place, and why she didn\u2019t file income tax returns on \ntime.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:              \nAgainst Applicant \n \n            Subparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d:                        For Applicant  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                    Robert J.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 26, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant responded to the SOR on September 5, 2018, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel amended the SOR on an \nindeterminate date adding allegations under Guideline B, foreign influence. Applicant \nresponded to the amended SOR on April 9, 2019. The case was assigned to me on July \n3, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled on July 18, 2019.  \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A through L, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit \n\n \n2 \n \nadditional information. He submitted documents that I have marked AE M and M-1 \nthrough M-7 (AE M is an e-mail and M-1 through M-7 are the attachments to that e-mail) \nand admitted without objection. \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Sudan. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not \nbe repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that Sudan has been a state \nsponsor of terrorism with a dismal human rights record. Terrorists groups are active in \nSudan. Armed conflicts have raged in and around Sudan, and the government was \nrecently overthrown, resulting in a national state of emergency.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since February 2018. He has a master\u2019s degree from an Indian \nuniversity. He is married with two children. (Tr. at 14-15, 31, 56; GE 1-3.) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Sudan to Sudanese parents. He immigrated to the United \nStates under the lottery system in 1997. He became a U.S. citizen in 2002. His wife is a \nU.S. citizen originally from Sudan. His children were born in the United States. His in-\nlaws are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. at 14, 31-32, 42; GE1-3) \n \n \nApplicant came from a large family. His parents have been deceased for \ndecades.

(Tr. at 14-16, 37-38, 40-41, 44; GE 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he attributed to his and his \nwife\u2019s unemployment, underemployment, and medical problems, particularly during \nperiods of unemployment when they did not have medical insurance. The SOR alleges \n17 delinquent debts totaling about $51,200. Five of the debts, totaling about $10,250, \nare medical debts. Two debts totaling about $4,560 are defaulted student loans. Except \nas addressed below, the allegations are established through credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. (Tr. at 14-15, 49-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-6) \nSince he was hired by his current employer in February 2018, he has been addressing \nthe debts as follows: \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent loan with a balance of $16,875. The loan was for \nin vitro fertilization (IVF) for his wife to conceive their second child. Applicant entered \ninto a $100 per month payment plan in August 2018. He documented $100 payments in \nAugust, September, and October 2018. He entered into another $100 per month \npayment plan on August 2019. The balance is $12,459. It is unclear if the balance \nreflects additional undocumented payments. (Tr. at 57-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 4-6; AE F, L, M, M-4) \n \n \nA collection company is collecting three debts totaling $10,200 owed to the same \nbank (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d). Applicant agreed to a $50 per month payment plan in August \n2018. He documented $50 payments in August, September, and October 2018. His \nchecking account reflects 11 additional $50 checks, but he did not provide the cancelled \nchecks, so they cannot be positively accredited as payments. However, I note that the \nbalances on the accounts have gone down. The balance of the SOR \u00b6 1.b debt was \n$3,648 in August 2017; $3,298 in March 2019; and $3,148 in August 2019. The balance \nof the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was $3,287 in May 2018 and $3,137 in August 2019. \nThe balance of the SOR \u00b6 1.d debt was $3,279 in August 2017; $2,929 in March 2019; \nand $2,729 in August 2019. (Tr. at 64-72; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE E, \nJ, L, M, M-5, M-6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a charged-off $3,075 credit card debt. Applicant and the \ncreditor settled the debt in August 2018 for 31 monthly $100 payments. In July 2019, \nthe creditor verified that they had received $1,200 in payments, and the balance was \n$1,996. (Tr. at 74-77; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE G, M, M-2, M-3) \n \n \nApplicant has brought his two student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h) out of default, \nand he is current on their combined monthly payments of $50. Because of interest, the \nbalances had increased from the total amount alleged in the SOR ($4,560) to $4,676. \nRecent payments have reduced the total balance of the two loans to $4,415. (Tr. at 77-\n79; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE L, M-5, M-6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a charged-off $2,528 credit card debt. Applicant entered into a \n$50 per month payment plan in August 2018. The balance of the debt was $2,200 in \nMarch 2019 and $2,000 in August 2019. (Tr. at 80; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-\n6; AE D, M-2, M-3) \n \n \nA collection company is collecting two debts that at one time totaled $2,077 owed \nto the same bank (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k). In August 2018, Applicant agreed to payment \nplans of $49.16 and $49.83 per month for the two debts. He documented his payments \nand reduced the total amount owed on the two debts to $1,384 in March 2019 and $889 \nin August 2019. (Tr. at 82-85; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE I, L, M, M-5, M-\n6) \n \n \nApplicant paid the $56 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. He denied owing the $1,560 \ndebt owed to a telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.i). He stated that the company \ncharged him after he cancelled service, and they refused to accept his cell phone back. \nHe disputed the debt with the credit reporting agencies, but the debt continues to be \n\n \n4 \n \nlisted on his credit reports. (Tr. at 81-82, 85-87; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; \nAE H, M-1, M-5, M-6) \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $2,250 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. He stated \nthat it is not listed on his credit reports; he did not recognize the creditor; and he did not \nknow what the debt was for. The debt is listed by Experian on the August 2017 \ncombined credit report. It is not listed on any of the subsequent credit reports in \nevidence. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE M-5, M-6) \n \n \nApplicant stated that he paid the $134 and $76 medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and \n1.o). The creditors for the debts are listed simply as \u201cMEDICAL\u201d on the 2017 and 2018 \ncredit reports. He documented a $150 payment to a creditor in September 2018. The \n$134 debt is not listed on any credit report after May 2018. The $76 debt is listed by \nEquifax on the August 2017 combined credit report, but it is not listed on the May 2018 \nand March 2019 Equifax credit reports. There is a $76 medical debt listed in the August \n2019 Equifax credit report, which may correspond to the debt alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at \n90; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE M, M-5, M-6, M-7) \n \n \nApplicant stated that he has payment plans of $60 each per month for the last \ntwo medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p - $6,468 and 1.q - $1,319). He documented a $50 \npayment in September 2018 to the creditor identified in SOR \u00b6 1.q. The debts are listed \nby Experian on the August 2017 combined credit report. They are not listed on any \nsubsequent credit report. (Tr. at 85, 90; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE M, M-\n5, M-6, M-7) \n \n \nApplicant paid or has payment plans for all but one of the non-medical debts \nalleged in the SOR. He has reduced the total amount owed on the non-medical debts \nfrom almost $41,000 to about $32,300. The status of the medical debts is unclear, but \nhis most recent credit report only lists one $76 medical debt. He credibly testified that he \nis committed to paying all the debts that he legitimately owes. (Tr. at 15, 47-48, 88, 93-\n98) \n \n \nApplicant has worked as a linguist in support of the U.S. military in the Middle \nEast since February 2018. He submitted documents and a letter from U.S. military \npersonnel attesting to his excellent job performance, professionalism, commitment, \nexpertise, dedication, and positive attitude, which \u201cwere critical to the success of the \nmission.\u201d (AE B, C) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \n\n \n6 \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nSudan has been a state sponsor of terrorism with a dismal human rights record. \nTerrorists groups are active in Sudan. Armed conflicts have raged in and around Sudan, \nand the government was recently overthrown, resulting in a national state of \nemergency. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n \n7 \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Sudan. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas in support of the \nnational defense. He credibly testified that his family in Sudan could not be used to \ncoerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. His wife, children, and in-\nlaws are all U.S. citizens and residents. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Sudan are outweighed by his deep and long-\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. I find that it is unlikely he will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States \nand the interests of Sudan. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. The above mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans \nand delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his and his wife\u2019s unemployment, \nunderemployment, and medical problems, particularly during periods of unemployment \nwhen they did not have medical insurance. He also took out a loan for IVF for his wife to \nconceive their second child. His financial problems were partially beyond his control, as \nthe costs associated with the IVF were not beyond his control. \n \n \nApplicant has been addressing the debts since he was hired by his current \nemployer in February 2018. He paid or has payment plans for all but one of the non-\nmedical debts alleged in the SOR. He has reduced the total amount owed on the non-\nmedical debts from almost $41,000 to about $32,300. The status of the medical debts is \nunclear, but his most recent credit report only lists one $76 medical debt. He credibly \ntestified that he intends to pay all the debts that he legitimately owes. \n \n  \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n\n9 \n \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nI believe Applicant is honest and sincere in his intentions to be financially \nresponsible. There are clear indications that the problem is being resolved and is under \ncontrol. I find that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence and his work overseas in support of the \nnational defense. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence and financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.q: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct \ntrustworthiness concerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information in a \npublic trust position is granted. \n Statement of the Case \nOn August 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The action was taken \nunder DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG\u2019s) effective within the DOD for SORs issued after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, and elected to have a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 18, 2018. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing for November 21, \n2018, scheduling the hearing on December 6, 2018. I conducted the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 4, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B were \n01/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January \n2, 2019. \n \n \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR on September 24, 2018, Applicant admitted the 11 \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR, but she denied SOR \u00b6 1.f, stating that the \ncharged-off debt in the amount of $376 was paid in full. She stated that she filed a \npetition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on July 17, 2018. She attached the \nbankruptcy petition and ancillary schedules and documents, which indicated that a \npayment plan was entered with the trustee requiring Applicant to make 58 payments of \n$470 per month, starting on August 16, 2018. She attached a receipt corroborating this \npayment. All of the delinquencies alleged in the SOR (except SOR \u00b6 1.f) are addressed \nin her Chapter 13 repayment plan. (GE 3) \n                        \nApplicant is 44 years old. She graduated from high school in 1992. She never \nmarried, and is a single mother of a daughter, age 18, and a son, age 5. She is also \nfinancially responsible for raising a 17-year old nephew.3 She has been employed as a \nclaims analyst by a federal contractor for 19 years. She maintained a position of public \ntrust clearance for almost two decades, without issue. She is employed in a position of \npublic trust because she routinely accesses personal information. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits, and her testimony, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant provided a character reference letter attesting to her honesty, reliability \nand dependability. (AE A) She also provided several earnings statements from her \nemployer showing her net pay of approximately $437 every two weeks, and automatic \npayroll deduction of $470 each month paid to the bankruptcy trustee pursuant to her \nChapter 13 plan. (AE B) The documents reflect a steady stream of payments to the \ntrustee from August to December 2018. She had financial counseling as a prerequisite \nto filing the bankruptcy petition.4 This was her first time filing for bankruptcy protection.  \n \n  \n            \nFive of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.j, 1.k, and \n1.i) were for credit cards that Applicant used to pay living expenses while she struggled \nto raise three children as a single mother with a meager salary.5 She received no child \nsupport or financial assistance from the biological fathers of these children, but she did \nreceive monthly social security checks for $281 and $781 for her two biological \nchildren.6 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are delinquent debts related to automobiles that were \nrepossessed when Applicant could not keep up with payments on the automobile loans.  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.l are for delinquent medical bills amounting to $343 and $45. These \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 28, 29. \n \n4 Tr. at 44. \n \n5 Tr. at 36, 56. \n \n6 Tr. at 47. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwere incurred at a time when she lacked adequate medical insurance. All of the alleged \ndelinquent debts are reflected in her credit report. (GE 2) \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that when she completed security clearance applications  \n(SCAs) previously in her 19 year career in a position of public trust, she was always \nprovided with a credit report by her employer. However, when she completed the SCA \n(GE 1) on January 22, 2018, she felt rushed by her supervisor, as she went back and \nforth to make corrections, four times.7 She did not have access to a credit report and \nshe did not know all of the details of her delinquent debts when she answered the \nquestions in section 26 (Financial Record) negatively. She did not have a specific intent \nto deliberately deceive the government because she reasonably believed she could \ndiscuss the debts at the follow-up clearance interview, which was specifically intended \nfor amplification or elaboration, in her experience.8  \n \n  \n         \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13 and part \n154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position Categories and Criteria for Designating Positions)  \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 44 - 46. \n \n8 Tr. at 18, 44. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a [trustworthiness] concern insofar as it may \nresult from criminal activity, including espionage.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the government\u2019s exhibits support the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions:  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant admitted the 12 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR totaling over \n$26,288. These consumer debts are evidenced by her 2018 credit bureau report. There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n  \n \nApplicant is a single mother of three children who struggled to make ends meet \non a modest income. She receives no child support from the biological fathers. These \nare circumstances beyond her control. Her biological daughter is now 18 years old, and \nher nephew is 17. Her financial responsibility for them should decrease as they enter \nadulthood. She has worked continuously for 19 years in a sensitive position, and she \nhas recently entered into a Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan that includes all of \nher SOR creditors. She had financial counseling as a precondition of filing the Chapter \n13 petition in July 2018. She has steadfastly made a stream of payments of $470 each \nmonth, in compliance with the bankruptcy plan. She has demonstrated her good-faith \nintentions to address the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. She paid the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f in full. All of the mitigating conditions enumerated above apply.  \n. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n           The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n  \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \n personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant omitted her delinquent debts in section 26 of her 2018 SCA. I find that \nApplicant did not have the intent to deliberately falsify her 2018 SCA as alleged. She \ntestified credibly that she did not have access to a credit report and she felt pressured to \nrush the completion of her SCA. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunder Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines. Applicant is a single-mother of three \nchildren and she struggled to keep up with living expenses and uncovered medical \nexpenses. She has also endured a downturn in the economy.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances no longer remain a trustworthiness concern. She has met \nher burden of persuasion. She did not specifically intend to deceive the government \nwhen she completed her SCA. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct \ntrustworthiness concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n          FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:                       For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                       FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:                                   For Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is   \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a  \npublic trust position.

Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn July 2, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications\nFacility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why\nDOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Adjudicative\nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/15/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 16, 2018, and elected to have her case\ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on August 28, 2018, interposed no objections to the materials in the\nFORM, and did not supplement the FORM. The case was assigned to me on January 2,\n2019. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) accumulated six delinquent debts\nexceeding $8,000 and (b) filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in August 2016\n(dismissed in February 2018) and March 2018 (disposition undetermined). Allegedly, the\ndebts owing have not been resolved and remain outstanding. \n                \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the allegations and\ndid so with explanations, denying only the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.h. She claimed\nshe stopped making payments on her 2016 Chapter 13 petition when she went on\nmedical leave, which resulted in a dismissal of her petition. She claimed she is currently\nmaking payments on her 2018 Chapter 13 petition. And she claimed the 2015 judgment\n(covered by SOR \u00b6 1.h) has been satisfied. Applicant did not provide any documentation\nto support any of her claims.\nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old quality inspector for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant married her first spouse in November 1991 and divorced in January\n1995. (Item 3) She has one child and one stepchild from this marriage. (Items 3-4) She\nremarried in June 1999 and has four children and one stepchild from this marriage. \n(Items 3-4) She earned a high school diploma in May 1990. (Item 4). She attended a local\ncommunity college between January 2007 and August 2009, but earned no degree or\ndiploma. (Items 3-4) Applicant reported no military service. She has been employed by\nher current employer since October 1999 and has held a security clearance since April\n2010. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1999, 2003, 2016, and\n2018. (Items Records confirm that her 1999 and 2003 petitions were discharged in\nJanuary 2000 and March 2009, respectively. (Items 9-10). Bankruptcy records confirm\nthat her 2016 petition was dismissed in February 2018 at Applicant\u2019s request. (Item 8)\nShe cited medical leave as a consideration, but provided no documentation. (Item 2)\nApplicant\u2019s latest Chapter 13 petition remains pending without any reported status or\ndisposition. (Item 7)\n2\n\nBetween March 2016 and June 2016, Applicant took out three loans with the same\nlender, totaling in excess of $5,000. (Item 4) Two of the loans became over 120 days past\ndue in November 2016, and the third loan became more than 90 days past due in\nNovember 2016. (Item 4) Other delinquent debts revealed in her credit reports are a\nmedical debt for $178 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and an entered judgment in 2015 for $1,261. (Items 4-\n5) Whether Applicant included these debts in his 2018 Chapter 13 petition is unclear.\nWithout documented Chapter 13 schedules to review, answers cannot be learned. (Items\n5-7) Applicant attributed her debt delinquencies to both her husband\u2019s illness and loss of\nemployment and her own loss of earnings stemming from a lengthy medical leave. (Items\n2 and 4) While her husband\u2019s condition and circumstances, as well her own medical\nissues, are potentially extenuating, they are not corroborated and substantiated by\ndocumented support for her claims.\nTo date, Applicant has not provided any updates as to what steps she has taken to\nresolve the delinquent debts covered in the SOR. Conceivably, these debts are\nscheduled in her 2018 Chapter 13 petition and are being addressed. Without more\ninformation from Applicant on debts included in her Chapter 13 petition and how they are\nbeing administered in her Chapter 13 petition, no inferences can be drawn as to how she\nis resolving these debts. (Items 4\u20136) \nApplicant provided no budgets or evidence of financial counseling. Nor did she\nprovide character references from colleagues at work and in her community who know\nher well and can attest to her honesty, trustworthiness, and good judgment, or .personnel\nevaluations.\nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns. These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the context\nof the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(d) of\nthe AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \n3\n\nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\n       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\n4\n\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s history of multiple filings of Chapter\n13 bankruptcy petitions seeking to address her finances (two discharged, one dismissed\nat her request, and a fourth still pending) and more recently, accumulating delinquent\ndebts exceeding $8,000. Applicant\u2019s recurrent Chapter 13 petitions and debt\ndelinquencies warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts and foreclosures negate the need for any\nindependent proof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262\n(6th ed. 2006). Each of Applicant\u2019s admitted state tax lien, home equity loan deficiency,\nand two foreclosures are fully documented and create some judgment issues. See\nISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security\nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing lapses\nand debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing delinquent debts is critical to an assessment\nof an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and\nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a\nsensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR\nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited extenuating\ncircumstances (i.e., medical issues and associated unemployment of her husband and\nher own medical issues that necessitated considerable medical leave) provide some\nmitigation credit for her accumulating delinquent debt. The cited circumstances she\nattributes to her debt delinquencies are enough to entitle her to some extenuating\n5\n\nbenefits from MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d But her failure to provide documented\nproof of her addressing her debts after she returned to full-time employment status\nprecludes her from taking advantage of the \u201cacted responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6 20(b)\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable, the timely resolution of\nfederal and state tax debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, her failures to provide documented proof of her addressing her\ndelinquent debts in any probative way preludes favorable findings and conclusions with\nrespect to raised security concerns over the state of her finances. \nWhole-Person Assessment\nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. She has shown\ninsufficient  progress to date in addressing her delinquent debts to merit enough positive\noverall credit to mitigate financial concerns. Overall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in\naddressing her finances reflect too little evidence of restored financial responsibility and\njudgment to overcome reasonable doubts about her trustworthiness, reliability, and\nability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that her\nfinances are not sufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility\nrequirements for holding a security clearance.  Eligibility to hold a security clearance\nunder the facts and circumstances of this case is inconsistent with the national interest.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:\n    Against Applicant\n   \n             \n \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\nhold a security clearance.

He has worked for his defense-contractor \nemployer since September 2008. In April 2014, Applicant began cohabiting with his spouse \nin her home. They married in June 2015, and they had a son in August 2018. (Items 2-3.)  \n \nOn August 9, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86.) In response to an inquiry concerning \nthe illegal use of a drug or controlled substance in the last seven years, Applicant indicated \nthat he used marijuana for the first time in college in September 2005. He gave an \nestimated date of July 2017 for his most recent use and explained that he had attended a \ncomedy show with his family and his cousin gave him \u201cinfused drinks.\u201d Applicant denied \nany intention of future illegal drug use, and added, \u201cI plan on starting a family with my wife. \nMy kid needs the best of me.\u201d Applicant denied any involvement in other illegal drug activity \nin the last seven years, including any purchase. (Item 3.) \n\n3 \n \nOn December 20, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator, in part \nabout his drug use. He described himself as a social smoker. He reportedly indicated that \nhe first used marijuana at age \u201c10\u201d and most recently in July 2017 at the comedy show, \nwhen he had drinks infused with marijuana. He explained that he used marijuana once to \ntwice year except when he was in college, when he used marijuana twice a month at \nfraternity events. He denied ever purchasing marijuana. He admitted that there was a \nlikelihood that he would use marijuana in the future. Applicant volunteered that he had \nreceived an email two months before his interview in which he was informed of declination \nof an interim clearance for him. He indicated that he was given a list of possible reasons for \nthe denial but not a specific reason. (Item 4.) \n \nApplicant was interviewed by another OPM investigator on February 14, 2018. He \nindicated that he was a former marijuana smoker. He denied any use of marijuana since \nMay or June 2017 and any chance of future use. (Item 4.) \n \nDOHA sent Applicant interrogatories concerning his illegal drug use. In his response \ndated July 24, 2018, Applicant indicated that he used cannabis from July 2000 to February \n2018 once a year. He admitted that he had used marijuana after applying for a security \nclearance and stated, \u201cThe last big party before I have my son, wanted to go out for my last \nhooray before parenthood.\u201d He cited the upcoming birth of his son in August 2018 as the \nprecipitant in his decision to stop using marijuana because he needs to set an example for \nhis son. Applicant explained that his wife could verify his abstention. In the interrogatories, \nApplicant was given an opportunity to review the summary of his December 20, 2017 \ninterview. He adopted it without any changes. (Item 4.) It is unclear whether his use of \nmarijuana in February 2018 occurred before his February 14, 2018 interview. \n \nWhen he responded to the SOR on September 26, 2018, Applicant indicated that \nhis son was born in mid-August 2018. He denied any use of marijuana since February \n2018 and asserted that raising his son has become his \u201cnumber one goal.\u201d (Item 2.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n\n4 \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nThere is conflicting evidence about when he used marijuana. He told an OPM \ninvestigator that he first used marijuana at age 10. In response to DOHA interrogatories, he \nindicated that he used marijuana starting in July 2000. He would have been 13 years old at \n\n5 \n \nthat time. The evidence establishes that he used marijuana for at least 18 years before \nstopping in 2018. He used the drug socially, once or twice a year except for a two-year time \nspan starting in September 2005, when he used marijuana twice a month. Disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d applies. AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a \ncontrolled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d applies only in that Applicant had \nphysical possession of the drug on the occasions that he used it. There is no evidence that \nhe ever purchased marijuana or ever engaged in the other activities covered under AG \u00b6 \n25(c). AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse,\u201d is established \nbecause Applicant stated during his December 2017 subject interview that there was a \nlikelihood that his drug use would reoccur, and he used marijuana in at least February \n2018. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance misuse \n\u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Excepting the two years in the mid-2000s, when his \nmarijuana use increased to twice a month after he joined a fraternity, his drug use was \ninfrequent; once or twice during the course of a year. However, given he used marijuana \nover some 18 years to as recently as February 2018, it cannot reasonably be said that his \ndrug involvement happened so long ago or was \u201cso infrequent\u201d to trigger AG \u00b6 26(a) in \nmitigation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) has some applicability because Applicant acknowledges his drug \ninvolvement, and there is no evidence that he currently associates with drug-using \nassociates and contacts. AG \u00b6 26(b) provides: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s self-reporting of his marijuana involvement is some evidence of good \ncharacter.  Even so, it does not entitle him to a favorable security determination or negate \nthe security significance raised by his illegal use of marijuana, especially after he applied \nfor a security clearance. Applicant told an OPM investigator in December 2017 that he \nwould likely use marijuana in the future. He was interviewed by another OPM investigator \non February 14, 2018. At that time, he denied any use of marijuana since May 2017 or \n\n6 \n \nJune 2017. He told the investigator that there was no chance of him using marijuana in the \nfuture. However, he used marijuana in February 2018 at a party. His explanation is that he \n\u201cwanted to go out for [his] last hooray before parenthood.\u201d That use of marijuana, after he \nhad indicated that he would not use marijuana in the future, raises doubt about his ability to \ncommit to his stated intention to abstain.1 Applicant\u2019s present abstinence of one year as of \nthe close of the evidentiary record is very short in comparison to the 18 years over which \nhe used marijuana. Little is known about the circumstances of much of his marijuana use \nother than it was while socializing. He continued to use the drug after he was no longer in \nthe college environment. He provided no corroborating evidence from others attesting to \nhis change to a drug-free lifestyle after the birth of his son, which would include avoiding \nfriends and social functions that might be conducive to marijuana use. Applicant has yet to \nestablish a sufficient pattern of abstinence to mitigate the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).2 In making the overall commonsense determination required under AG \u00b6 2(c), I have \nonly the FORM, which shows Applicant cooperated with the investigation and adjudication \nprocess. While this is an important consideration, it is well settled that once a concern \narises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d \n1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The Government must be able to rely on those persons seeking \nsecurity clearance eligibility to comply with the Federal drug laws without regard to their \npersonal interests. For the reasons discussed, Applicant has raised enough doubt in that \nregard to where I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for a security clearance. \n                                                 \n1 It is unclear whether Applicant\u2019s February 2018 marijuana use occurred before or after his February 14, 2018 \ninterview. If before, then he concealed that drug use during his interview because he told the OPM investigator \nthat he had not used any marijuana since May or June 2017. \n \n2 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 26, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines J and E. The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 16, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nFebruary 6, 2019, scheduling the hearing for March 28, 2019. The hearing was \n\n \n2 \n \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented \nthree witnesses. Applicant submitted nine exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibit (AX) A \nthrough I, which were admitted without objection. I held the record open for the final \nexhibit, AE J, which is admitted without objection. The record then closed. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2, although he indicated they \nare not consistent with his current character. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in (1.a) under Guideline J, an October 2007 guilty plea to felony \ncharges of mail fraud and aiding and abetting and willfully causing an act to be done. It \nfurther alleges a June 2008 sentencing of 12 months and 1 day of imprisonment and 5 \nyears of supervised release. Applicant was ordered to pay restitution to his former \nemployer in the amount of $913,000. It cross alleges under Guideline E, the same \ninformation (2.a). Applicant admitted both allegations. \n \n \nApplicant is a 64-year-old security engineer for a defense contractor. He is \nmarried and has three adult children and four grandchildren. He received his \nundergraduate degree in 1975, master\u2019s degree in 1977, and his doctorate in 1990.  His \ndoctorate is in artificial intelligence, statistics, and computer science. Applicant has been \nwith his current employer since April 2013.  \n \n \nApplicant began a career in the academic world in approximately 1990. He was a \nlecturer at various universities and worked for a school system, and became the director \nof information systems and instructional technology until 1997.  Because of his great \nsuccess in the school system in implementing technology, he was invited by a board \nmember to join the corporate world.  (Tr. 77) \n \n \nApplicant accepted a position with a bank and used his impressive skills to \ncompletely restructure the bank\u2019s information system so that it could efficiently service \nits customers with faster service. He was given six months to accomplish this enormous \ntask.  (Tr. 81) He was quite successful in that environment.  \n \n \nAt one point in 1998, he began a \u201ctrek down a slippery slope\u201d. He was given \nmaterials for free and then charged by a contractor for billable hours. He knew this was \nnot quite right. (Tr. 93) He stated that he thought it was \u201ckind of fraudulent.\u201d  He stated \nthat the environment at the bank presented various opportunities on different levels to \nscam money from the bank. (Tr. 95) He was asked to note things that were not an \nemployee expense on invoices. He was asked to set up personal \u201cpoint of sale \ntechnology\u201d and charge it to the bank. Applicant saw that a cycle of behavior had begun \nthat was not legal. He admits that he should have stopped at that point, and he regrets \n\n \n3 \n \nthat he did not. He admits that he had never been tempted like that before. He saw that \nit became easier and easier to continue down the illegal path. (Tr. 98) He began \nreceiving gifts in 1998, such as a car for his illegal acts. He continued engaging in \ncriminal conduct and in 2002 he learned about \u201csoft dollars.\u201d (Tr. 103) In essence, every \nmarket trade made on every dollar produced a kickback. (Tr. 104-105) \n \n \nApplicant used some of the money that he illegally made to remodel his house or \nhelp his family. (Tr.108) He felt conflicted about his behavior, but he continued. A shell \ncorporation came into existence. At this point Applicant had about $400,000 of money \nthat was gained illegally. (Tr. 118)  He did not document the money for tax purposes. He \nknew he was scamming at that point or basically stealing money. (Tr.119) In about late \n2003 or 2004, an investigation occurred and the bank\u2018s managing partner told Applicant \nif he resigned, he would get six month\u2019s severance pay. (Tr. 124) \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant was investigated by the SEC for his misappropriation of funds. \n(GE 3) Applicant pled guilty to the felony charges of mail fraud and aiding and abetting. \n(GE 2) He was sentenced to prison in 2008, as described in the SOR. He had five years \nof supervised release. He was ordered to pay restitution to his former employer in the \namount of $913,000. (GE 4) \n \n \nApplicant completed his sentence without incident. His supervised release was \nterminated in 2011. (AE H) He used his time to help other inmates obtain a GED and he \nbecame a trusted prisoner. He testified at the hearing that he has no idea why he \ncommitted the crimes. His mother and father died in part due to his sentencing. He is \nsincerely remorseful and he cannot justify the behavior. (Tr. 134) He tutors children in \nthe local community. Applicant received an award from one employer in 2015 for group \nachievement. (AE I) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s probation was decreased from five years to two. He is making \ncontributions to his community. He has been paying the restitution. (GE 5)  He has paid \n$250 a month since 2011. He owes about $800,000. (GE 5, AE J) \n \n \nApplicant presented three witnesses who testified that he is worthy of a security \nclearance despite the criminal behavior. His current employer stated that he told her \nimmediately at the interview about the criminal conviction. She believes he is forthright \nand has valuable technical credentials. (Tr. 18) He has no authority over any funds. In \nhis current position. (Tr. 20) A former employee of the bank testified that he worked with \nApplicant from 1999 to 2004. Applicant was a respected boss and empowered his \nemployees to accomplish things. There was a memo from the bank that Applicant just \nresigned. (AE F) He was not aware of the criminal behavior that ensured at the bank \nwith Applicant. He saw Applicant after his release from prison and saw that he was \ndepressed and remorseful. (Tr. 42) This witness has no concerns about future criminal \nbehavior on Applicant\u2019s part. (Tr. 46) A third witness testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf, but \ndid not know the particulars of the criminal behavior. (Tr. 52)  \n \n \nApplicant presented six written affidavits from various people who know him as a \npatriot and a good man. His sister and wife attest that he was wrong for what he did but \n\n \n4 \n \nhe has paid a dear price. His cousin states that Applicant has turned his life around and \ndeserves a chance. A friend who has known Applicant since 2007, and holds a security \nclearance, understands the nature of the criminal activity but believes that Applicant \nwould not compromise any sensitive information. A longtime friend of Applicant\u2019s states \nthat Applicant is deserving of a second chance. (AE A-E)  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s 2017 investigative interview, he did not disclose his criminal \nbehavior, but rather stated that he resigned his job from the bank rather than be fired. \n(GE 4) He also did not disclose that he quit his employment with his bank in his 2005 \nsecurity clearance application. (GE 3) After he left the bank, he did not tell anyone about \nhis criminal behavior (except his attorneys). Applicant was given a polygraphs in 2005 \nand 2006, during which he initially denied criminal involvement with the bank. (GE 3, Tr. \n155) Applicant also failed to disclose his criminal activity to a subsequent employer \nbecause he feared that he would not get hired. (Tr. 159) In his latest security clearance \napplication, he inaccurately stated the reason for leaving the bank. When cross \nexamined at the hearing, Applicant explained that he did not read everything correctly \nand that he really did not understand the questions. \n \n \nApplicant submitted five letters of recommendation. Each reference from a \nformer employer knew Applicant for at least two years and described him as honest with \na positive attitude. Applicant has exceptional organization and communication skills. He  \nis reliable and motivated. One letter of recommendation commended Applicant for his \nability to encourage students and build self-esteem. He attends church and is a member \nof his church community.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n\n \n5 \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n  \n \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \n\n \n6 \n \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.  \n \nApplicant was convicted and sentenced for a felony charge in 2007 and 2008. He \nserved a year and a day in prison with five years of supervised release. He was ordered \nto pay restitution to his employer in the amount of $913,000. The evidence establishes \nthe disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s involvement in the above seems to have been an isolated \nevent from his work with the bank, the recency and severity of the behavior reduces \nmitigation. He is an educated man and yet from the beginning of his employment and \nfor about seven years he engaged in directing false invoices for payment and other \nillegal activities. He does not dispute this. He received a significant amount of illegal \nmoney and he knew it was wrong but did not stop. He did not tell the bank. He \ncompleted his sentence, and has sincere remorse for the criminal behavior. He has \nexcellent recommendations and affidavits. He works in the community, but given the \nfact that he used incredibly poor judgment for so many years, he has not met his burden \nin this case. His seven year pattern of engaging in illegal behaviors raised significant \nconcerns regarding his judgment, discretion, honesty, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under either of the above conditions. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \n\n \n7 \n \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n (b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s , the following disqualifying condition could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \ndistress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes; \n \n(1) Engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the persons\u2019 \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant admitted the security concerns under personal conduct in his answer to \nthe SOR, however he was initially dishonest with security representatives regarding his \ninvolvement in these activities.  His lack of candor during his investigations and \npolygraphs are noteworthy. He admitted that he did not disclose the full story either in \nwriting to his employer or during two investigations.  He is an educated man of 64 years. \nHe was involved in fraudulent activities for many years and admits that he knew he \nshould have stopped but did not until he was caught.  \n \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s testimony that he was initially \nembarrassed and humiliated by his behavior and hoped his crimes would not be \ndiscovered during his investigation. As a consequence he omitted relevant information \non three separate occasions. He still owes about $800,000 in restitution. I find \nsubstantial evidence of concealment of facts from his bank employer and the \ngovernment. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(e) is established. \n \n \nApplicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct his concealment.  \nHe spoke to two investigators and did not reveal the criminal activity until confronted. He \nfailed two polygraphs. Applicant has not persuaded me that similar lapses in judgment \nare unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nAG 17(c) does not apply because the offense is not minor. None of the other \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J and E, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant on three different occasions failed to disclose that he had a criminal \nconviction for a serious crime. He used incredibly poor judgment for almost seven years \nwhile he was engaging in the crimes. He has provided some mitigation, but it does not \noutweigh the serious security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct, and \ncriminal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On June 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 10, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. On February 28, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On March 5, \n2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for March 21, 2019. Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n\n \n2 \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and \n2.  Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. I admitted all proffered exhibits \ninto evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 1, \n2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. He earned some college credits, but not enough for a \ncollege degree. He has been married and divorced three times.  He has two adult children \nfrom his first marriage. He currently lives with a co-habitant, and also his mother, and his \nyounger brother recently moved into his home. Since November 2017, Applicant has \nbeen employed full time by a defense contractor as a senior quality inspector. He does \nnot currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 12-13, 17; GE 1) \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from \napproximately 1990 to June 2017. He disclosed his history of marijuana use on his  SCA, \nand he admitted this allegation in his SOR response.  (Tr. 17; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant first started using marijuana at the age of 21. He continued to use \nmarijuana until June 2017, when he decided to quit using it altogether. His heaviest use \nof marijuana occurred during his early-to-mid 30s, when he used marijuana two to three \ntimes per day. He used marijuana because he enjoyed it. He purchased small amounts \nof marijuana over the years from his friends. Applicant no longer associates with these \nfriends. (Tr. 14-16; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant considered quitting his use of marijuana prior to June 2017. For the past \nfew years he had tapered off using marijuana. He realized that he no longer enjoyed using \nit, and he did not like how marijuana affected him mentally. He finally reached a point \nwhere he wanted to make positive changes and move forward with his life. He quit all \nmarijuana use in June 2017. In November 2017, he was hired by his current employer. \n(Tr. 16-18, 23) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer required him to take a drug test prior to making him an offer \nof employment. Three months after he was hired, Applicant was required to take another \ndrug test. He has never tested positive for any type of illegal drug. Other than marijuana, \nhe has not used any other illegal drug. He has never been cited for any offense related \nto illegal drugs. He has never felt addicted to marijuana, and he denied any cravings for \nmarijuana since he stopped using it in June 2017. His co-habitant does not use marijuana. \nApplicant understands marijuana use is against Federal law, and is unacceptable for \nindividuals possessing DOD security clearances. In early 2018, Applicant signed a letter \nof intent declaring that that he had no intent to use marijuana in the future, and \nacknowledging that any future illegal drug use would be grounds for automatic revocation \nof his clearance. (Tr. 18-21, 23-25; AE A) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work record is excellent. Within 15 months of being hired, he was \npromoted to a supervisor position. He takes a great deal of pride in his work for the DOD. \nHe wanted to be completely candid about his past drug use when he completed the SCA \nin December 2017. He is steadfast in remaining drug-free and his co-habitant and family \nare very supportive of his commitment. (Tr. 20-21, 24) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n4 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following is potentially applicable: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from about 1990 to June 2017. The above disqualifying \ncondition applies.  \n \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant has used marijuana over a long period of time. He tapered off from using \nmarijuana over the last few years of his marijuana use because: he no longer enjoyed \n\n \n5 \n \nusing marijuana; he did not like how it affected him mentally; and he wanted to make \npositive changes in his life. Applicant has not used or craved marijuana in two years. He \nprovided a letter of intent to never use marijuana again, and understands that marijuana \nis against Federal law and is unacceptable for holders of a DOD security clearance. He \nwas candid with his history of marijuana use when he completed the SCA in December \n2017. I find Applicant is sincere in his commitment to remain drug-free, and his excellent \nwork record supports his determination to make positive changes in his life. Mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \n \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant has made positive changes in his life, which is supported by his \npromotion to supervisor within 15 months after being hired by his employer. He is \ncommitted to remaining drug-free, and I find his future use of marijuana is unlikely to \nrecur. After evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. She married in 2006 and has one child born in 2017. She has been employed by the same federal contractor since 2004.1 Applicant disclosed on her December 2016 security clearance application (SCA) the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-$18,298; 1.b-$12,550; and 1.c-$7978). The debts became delinquent in approximately 2011 or 2012. Applicant attributed her financial problems to the loss of her husband\u2019s job in 2011, and mismanaging her finances. With regard to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, she stated she made a decision to pay other bills and would pay these debts when she was more financially stable. She said she did not become financially stable until 2015. Subsequently the creditors stopped contacting her, and she did not follow up to resolve these debts. With regard to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, she stated she intended to contact the creditor and arrange a payment plan. This debt was charged off in 2012.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 24, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 14, 2018, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on November \n14, 2018. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \n03/06/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 8. Applicant submitted a timely \nresponse and her exhibit is marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. There were no \nobjections by Applicant or Department Counsel and all Items and AE A are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on February 11, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nAs part of the Government\u2019s FORM, it withdrew the Guideline B allegation.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. She married in \n2006 and has one child born in 2017. She has been employed by the same federal \ncontractor since 2004.1  \n \nApplicant disclosed on her December 2016 security clearance application (SCA) \nthe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-$18,298; 1.b-$12,550; and 1.c-$7978). \nThe debts became delinquent in approximately 2011 or 2012. Applicant attributed her \nfinancial problems to the loss of her husband\u2019s job in 2011, and mismanaging her \nfinances. With regard to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, she stated she made a decision \nto pay other bills and would pay these debts when she was more financially stable. She \nsaid she did not become financially stable until 2015. Subsequently the creditors stopped \ncontacting her, and she did not follow up to resolve these debts. With regard to the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a, she stated she intended to contact the creditor and arrange a payment plan. \nThis debt was charged off in 2012. Applicant stated: \u201cSince 2011, I have tried to make a \nbetter effort at being more responsible with my finances and am more financially stable \nnow. Please consider that I am trying to take responsibility for my previous financial \nmistakes.\u201d2  \n \nIn February 2017, Applicant\u2019s son was born prematurely and was required to stay \nin the hospital for 10 weeks. Applicant had a high medical insurance deductible and \nincurred medical expenses. She has paid them.3 \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. She told \nthe investigator that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were personal loans she obtained \nin 2009 and used for general expenses. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was a credit card that she \nobtained in 2010 for general expenses. At the time, both she and her husband were \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Item 4.  \n \n3 Items 3, 5. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nemployed. Her husband lost his job in 2011, and their financial situation became tighter. \nShe stated that she had not made any attempt to repay these loans or the credit card, but \nintended to do so by 2018 because her husband had resumed working.4  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she reiterated that the loss of her husband\u2019s \nincome in 2011 impacted their finances. They moved into her mother\u2019s house, but their \ndebts exceeded her income. The premature birth of her son in February 2017, and his \nhigh medical expenses, also impacted her finances, but she has managed to pay the \nmedical debts. She said that over the past seven years she has managed their money \nbetter and they were living within their means. She stated: \u201cAfter I have been caught up \non paying off my current bills, I have every intention of repaying my past debts.\u201d5 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s December 2018 response to the FORM, she stated that her current \nfinancial priority is to make payments on a home equity loan on her mother\u2019s house where \nApplicant, her husband, and child live. She has been making payments on this loan since \n2006. She stated, \u201cEven though I mentioned my husband and I became more financially \nstable in 2015 due to his new job, I admit I did not try and resolve my past debts because \nI was able to pay more down on the Home Equity Loan during 2015 and 2016.\u201d6 She also \nwas paying medical expenses for her son.7  \n \nApplicant stated that she has a balance of about $18,000 on credit card accounts \nthat are current. She and her mother are joint owners on one of the cards, and she and \nher husband are joint owners on another. Applicant confirmed that she took vacation trips \nin October 2014, June 2016, and October 2016. She explained that her mother paid for \nthe 2014 trip. The other two trips were part of a free all-inclusive resort package. Her \nmother paid for the airfare for the June 2016 trip, and Applicant paid for her and her \nhusband\u2019s airfare for the October 2016 trip. She admitted she did not act responsibly \nwhen she owed delinquent debts. Applicant stated that she wants to resolve her \ndelinquent debts, but did not want to overextend her finances at this time. She said that \nshe needs more time and is hoping to resolve the debts sometime in 2019. \n \nApplicant did not provide information on her or her husband\u2019s income; the amount \nshe is paying toward the home equity loan; whether she has contacted any of her \ncreditors; whether she has a budget; or why she failed to address the delinquent debts \nafter she became more financially stable in 2015, before her son was born. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and credit reports from March 2017 and April 2018 corroborate the debts \nalleged in the SOR.8 \n \n                                                          \n4 Item 5. \n \n5 Item 3.  \n \n6 AE A. \n \n7 AE A. \n \n8 Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has three large debts that became delinquent in 2011 and total \napproximately $38,826. She is unable to pay these debts at this time. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \n \nApplicant has not paid or provided evidence of any action she has taken to resolve \nthe delinquent debts that are now more than eight years old. The debts are recent and \nongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to the loss of income when her husband \nbecame unemployed in 2011. This was beyond her control. She also attributed it to \nmismanaging her finances, which was within her control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. Applicant indicated that her finances \nimproved and stabilized in 2015, but she decided to pay her mother\u2019s home equity loan \non the house where Applicant and her family live, rather than address her delinquent \ndebts. This situation occurred before her son was born in February 2017. She did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to show she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant had an opportunity, when her finances stabilized, to begin to address her \ndelinquent debts that she was aware were a security concern. She indicated on her 2016 \nSCA that she should have contacted the creditors in 2015, but did not because she was \npaying other accounts. She indicated during her 2017 background interview that she \nwould begin addressing them. She made the same assertion in her August 2018 answer \nto the SOR and in her December 2018 response to the FORM. However, Applicant did \nnot provide evidence that she has taken any steps to resolve these delinquent debts. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) has partial application.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. There is no \nevidence she is making good-faith efforts to pay any of the accounts alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. His financial problems began in approximately 2011 \nwhen her husband lost his job. She also attributed her financial problems to \nmismanagement. Applicant failed to provide evidence that she has taken action to begin \nto resolve the delinquent debts. She indicated that her priority is to pay down a home \nequity loan on her mother\u2019s house where she and her family live. Applicant did not provide \nevidence of a current financial budget; ability to repay her delinquent debts; or a plan for \nresolving her financial problems. She did not provide evidence that she contacted her \ncreditors and is making payment arrangements. At this juncture, Applicant has not met \nher burden of persuasion or established a reliable financial track record. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

He served in the U.S Navy from 1965 to 1969 as a Navy Seal and is a combat veteran. Applicant does not require a security clearance for his current position, but eligibility would increase his job prospects and earning potential. Applicant completed a security clearance application, his first, in December 2017. The ensuing investigation revealed that Applicant owes $168,000 in federal taxes for the 2011 through 2015 tax years, which is alleged in the SOR. Though unalleged, the record also revealed that in 2014, Applicant resolved a $96,509 federal tax lien for unpaid federal income taxes from 2008 to 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) Applicant incurred federal tax debt because he did not withhold federal or state income taxes from his pay from 2004 to 2015.

Applicant failed to \nmitigate security concerns raised by his outstanding $168,000 federal income tax debt. \nClearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 22, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017.   \n \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \na determination whether to deny his security clearance. Applicant timely answered the \n\n \n2 \n \nSOR and requested a hearing. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1). At the hearing, convened on \nApril 10, 2019, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A and B, without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, 72, has worked for his current employer a federal contractor since \nJanuary 2017. He served in the U.S Navy from 1965 to 1969 as a Navy Seal and is a \ncombat veteran. Applicant does not require a security clearance for his current position, \nbut eligibility would increase his job prospects and earning potential. Applicant \ncompleted a security clearance application, his first, in December 2017. The ensuing \ninvestigation revealed that Applicant owes $168,000 in federal taxes for the 2011 \nthrough 2015 tax years, which is alleged in the SOR. Though unalleged, the record also \nrevealed that in 2014, Applicant resolved a $96,509 federal tax lien for unpaid federal \nincome taxes from 2008 to 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 34.)  \n \n \nApplicant incurred federal tax debt because he did not withhold federal or state \nincome taxes from his pay from 2004 to 2015. Applicant lived and worked overseas \nbetween 2004 and 2014 (with the exception of one year between 2009 and 2010), \nearning approximately $200,000 annually. Although he timely filed his income tax \nreturns, Applicant admitted that he could not afford his tax liabilities because he lived \nbeyond his means and prioritized other expenses to support his lifestyle. Between \nJanuary and July 2015, Applicant paid $4,000 each month toward his federal tax debt. \nHe was laid off in August 2015 and could no longer afford to make any payments. When \nhe returned to work in January 2017, he did not immediately resume payments on his \nfederal tax debt because he was focused on other financial obligations, including a \nwage garnishment for a $20,000 child support arrearage, a $20,000 state income tax \ndebt for the years 2011 to 2015, and a student loan payment. Applicant established an \ninstallment agreement with the IRS in June 2018, under which he agreed to pay $500 \neach month. According to the record, Applicant made one payment in September 2018. \nHe did not provide evidence of ongoing compliance with the installment agreement. \n(Answer; GE 2; Tr. 17-19, 22, 22-25, 27-31, 38-39, 43, 60-67.) \n \n  \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he intends to resolve his tax debt by \ndoubling his monthly payments to $1,000 per month. However, he cannot afford to do \nso. Applicant earns approximately $94,000 annually and receives $24,000 each year in \nsocial security income. He supports a family of five, including his wife and his three \nminor children from another relationship. After paying his family\u2019s living expenses and \nhis other recurring financial obligations, Applicant has no disposable income. At hearing, \nApplicant stated that he intends to satisfy his federal tax debt by selling property he \nowns in Country 1, valued at $600,000 (USD). However, the co-owner of the property \nrefuses to consent to the sale. Applicant has retained an attorney based in Country 1 to \nhelp resolve this issue and sell the home. (Tr. 26, 36-38, 40-42, 50-58, 70-72, 75-78.)  \n \n \nApplicant timely filed his 2017 and 2018 income tax returns. He owes \napproximately $4,200 in federal taxes for 2018 and expects a $1,700 refund of his state \n\n \n3 \n \ntaxes. He plans to pay the 2018 balance by withdrawing money from his retirement \nsavings and cash savings. (Tr. 73-75.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima \nfacie case that Applicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes as required for the \n2011 through 2015 tax years. (AG \u00b619(f)). The record also establishes that Applicant \ndoes not currently have the ability to pay his outstanding tax debt. (AG \u00b6 19(a)).  \n \nApplicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his tax debt. Applicant\u2019s history of tax problems is not limited to the \nperiod alleged in the SOR. The record establishes that Applicant began having tax \nproblems as early as 2008. Furthermore, he also owes a state tax liability for the period \nalleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s tax problems were not caused by events beyond his \ncontrol, but by living beyond his means and prioritizing the expenses demanded by his \nlifestyle choices over his obligation to the government. Although Applicant entered into \nan installment agreement with the IRS in June 2018, he has failed to establish a \nconsistent history of compliance with that agreement. None of the financial \nconsiderations mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has failed to mitigate the concerns raised by his \nhistory of tax problems. Applicant\u2019s tax problems are not under control and he has not \nestablished that he can properly manage his income tax obligations going forward.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n________________________ \nNichole L.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n07/23/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 1, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) containing six Items, and it was received \nby Applicant on May 3, 2019. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to \n\n \n2 \n \n \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days \nof receipt of the FORM. Applicant provided a response and documentary evidence that \nare marked as AE A (five pages) and B (four pages). There were no objections to any of \nthe evidence and it was admitted into the record. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) assigned this case to me on June 24, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts about South Korea contained in Item 6. Applicant did not object, and I have \ntaken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are supported by \nsource documents from official U.S. Government publications that were provided with the \nFORM. The facts are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant partially admitted and denied the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.a. He admitted \nthe SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. He denied the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.d. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. He married in 1990 and divorced in 1998. He has a 29-\nyear old son from this marriage. He remarried in 2002 and divorced in 2010. He remarried \nin 2013. He and his wife have a seven-year-old son. He served in the U.S. Air Force from \n1990 to 1992 and received a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions. He served \nin the Army National Guard for one year and received an Honorable Discharge. He served \nin the Army from 2003 to 2011 and received a General Discharge under Honorable \nConditions. Applicant has worked for a federal contractor since January 2016. He \ncurrently works in South Korea. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen and resident of South Korea. His younger son was born \nin South Korea and is dual citizen of South Korea and the United States. Applicant met \nhis wife while serving in the military in South Korea. Applicant, his wife, and son presently \nlive in South Korea. He and his wife intend to relocate to the United States after he \ncompletes his employment in South Korea. They also intend on her applying for U.S. \ncitizenship status once they relocate. During his February 2017 background interview, he \ndisclosed that his wife was unemployed. He noted that she had no affiliation with the \nSouth Korean government, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, or \nintelligence service. (Item 5) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of South \nKorea. His wife\u2019s two sisters and brother are citizens and residents of South Korea. He \nstated his contact with his wife\u2019s parents is about once a month when they come to visit \nthem. His contact with his wife\u2019s siblings is about every three months. His mother-in-law \nhas never been employed outside of the home. His father-in-law works for a corporation. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHis brother-in-law works on a U.S. military base. The occupations of the two sisters-in-\nlaw is unknown. (Items 3, 5) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife formerly owned an apartment in South Korea that she had \npurchased before she married. Her parents and brother lived in the apartment. The loan \nfor the apartment was transferred to her brother. Her brother is now the primary person \nresponsible for the loan, and Applicant\u2019s wife no longer has any responsibility or \nownership rights in the apartment. (Item 3; AE A, B, C).  \n \nThe Republic of Korea (South Korea) \n \n \nSouth Korea is a constitutional democracy governed by a president and \nunicameral legislature. Recent presidential elections were considered free and fair. \nCivilian authorities maintain effective control over security forces. The most significant \nhuman rights issues were the government\u2019s interpretation and application of National \nSecurity Law, libel laws, and other laws that limited freedom of expression and restricted \nInternet access; corruption, and domestic violence. \n \n \nThe United States Department of State has accessed the cities of Seoul and Busan \nas being low-threat locations for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. \ngovernment interests. It noted that while Americans are subject to worldwide threats of \ninternational terrorism, there is no specific information to suggest any specific terrorist \nthreats directed at Americans or American interests in South Korea. In addition, South \nKorea is the host to approximately 28,500 U.S. troops.  \n \n \nSouth Korea has made significant strides in terms of its protection of intellectual \nproperty rights. It cooperates with U.S. law enforcement to aggressively pursue criminal \ninvestigations and to seize counterfeit goods, including luxury items. Industrial espionage, \nhowever, remains a high-profile concern. There are reported criminal cases in the past of \nindustrial espionage and violations of export control laws. South Korea has been the \nunauthorized recipient of technology controlled under the U.S. export control laws.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation; \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, her parents, two sisters and a brother are citizens and residents \nof South Korea. Applicant obviously has regular contact with his wife, and has some \ncontact with his in-laws because he is currently living and working in South Korea. \nApplicant\u2019s wife no longer owns property in South Korea.  \n \nThere is a minimal threat of terrorism and some human rights problems in South \nKorea. I have considered the long-term friendly relationship between the United States \nand South Korea and do not find a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(e), and 7(f) do not apply. Because \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen and resident of South Korea, and her relatives are also, there \nis always a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect classified \nor sensitive information and his desire to help his foreign family members. AG \u00b6 7(b) has \nsome application. \n \nAfter the Government produced evidence of the disqualifying conditions, the \nburden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. The following \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests. \n \nThe risk of terrorism and potential for exploitation by the South Korean government \nis unlikely. Applicant\u2019s wife is unemployed and her family does not work for its \ngovernment. It is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of the United States and those of family members. AG \u00b6 8(a) \napplies.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to South Korea. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. None of these factors are present when analyzing South Korea\u2019s threat. There \nis some evidence of industrial espionage, but none that is orchestrated by the South \nKorean government. I find in the unlikely event that Applicant had to choose between a \nsense of loyalty to his foreign family members and those of the U.S. interest, he would \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. His wife is a citizen and resident of South Korea. \nApplicant currently works in South Korea. He and his wife intend to move to the United \nStates when his employment has ceased, and she intends to become a United States \ncitizen when eligible. Applicant provided evidence to meet his burden of persuasion. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with no questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 48 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in November 2000. She was married from 1993 to 1997. She married a second time in 1999, which ended in a divorce in 2011. She has a 16-year-old daughter from her second marriage. Applicant is a consultant for a DOD contracting group. She started this job in September 2010, but left the company in September 2016 for a project manager position in Germany. Applicant and her daughter moved to Germany in September 2016. She was terminated by that U.S. defense contractor in August 2017, and Applicant and her daughter returned to the U.S. Her previous employer then rehired Applicant in October 2017. Since 2010, she has possessed a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 12-15, 33; GE 1, AE A, AE B) The amended SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant deliberately omitted material facts during her background interview with a DOD authorized investigator on October 25, 2017. She had been asked if she had any law enforcement-related incidents while she was overseas, which Applicant denied. In fact, Applicant was charged with Driving under the Influence (DUI) in December 2016, with a blood-alcohol content of .061% (exceeding the German limit of .05%). She had been involved in a car accident and considered at fault. Applicant was also charged with child endangerment since her minor daughter was in her car. At the hearing, Applicant admitte",

On August 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nOn August 27, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \nOn September 24, 2018, Department Counsel sent Applicant an amended SOR, which \nincluded a change to the original SOR \u00b6 1.a, and also cross-alleged SOR \u00b6 1.a under \nboth Guideline G and Guideline J. On October 25, 2018, Applicant responded to the \namended SOR and she denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, and 3.a.  \n \nOn November 26, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On March 5, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for March 21, 2019. Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, Government \nExhibits (GE) 1-4, and Applicant offered ten exhibits, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-J. \nThere were no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant also testified. At the end of the hearing, without objection, I held the record \nopen at Applicant\u2019s request so she could submit additional evidence. (Tr. 6-7) On April \n1, 2019, DOHA received the hearing transcript. On May 3, 2019, Applicant\u2019s counsel \ntimely submitted AE K and L, which I entered into evidence without objection, and the \nrecord closed that same day.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact: Applicant is 48 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nNovember 2000. She was married from 1993 to 1997. She married a second time in \n1999, which ended in a divorce in 2011. She has a 16-year-old daughter from her \nsecond marriage. Applicant is a consultant for a DOD contracting group. She started \nthis job in September 2010, but left the company in September 2016 for a project \nmanager position in Germany. Applicant and her daughter moved to Germany in \nSeptember 2016. She was terminated by that U.S. defense contractor in August 2017, \nand Applicant and her daughter returned to the U.S. Her previous employer then \nrehired Applicant in October 2017. Since 2010, she has possessed a DOD security \nclearance. (Tr. 12-15, 33; GE 1, AE A, AE B)  \n \nThe amended SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant deliberately omitted material \nfacts during her background interview with a DOD authorized investigator on October \n25, 2017. She had been asked if she had any law enforcement-related incidents while \nshe was overseas, which Applicant denied. In fact, Applicant was charged with Driving \nunder the Influence (DUI) in December 2016, with a blood-alcohol content of .061% \n(exceeding the German limit of .05%). She had been involved in a car accident and \nconsidered at fault. Applicant was also charged with child endangerment since her \nminor daughter was in her car.  \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that she was involved in an incident in \nGermany in December 2016, which involved a traffic accident. She also admitted to \nconsuming alcohol prior to the accident. She had one \u201cvery full\u201d glass of wine while \nhaving dinner out with her daughter. At the time, she was stressed because she and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nher supervisor did not get along. Applicant drank the wine quickly, she did not feel \nintoxicated, and they left the restaurant to run errands. She was involved in a car \naccident shortly after leaving the restaurant. (Tr. 15-19) \nApplicant did not believe she was at fault for the car accident. She was struck \nby another car while she was attempting to make a turn. She reported the accident to \nthe U.S. military police. The German police arrived and asked Applicant and the other \ndriver to take a breathalyzer test. She tested over the German legal limit. She was \ncharged with DUI and she was also cited for causing the car accident. The U.S. \nmilitary police picked up Applicant and her daughter from the German police station. \nHer criminal case was transferred to the U.S. military\u2019s legal department. The U.S. \nCommand suspended her driver\u2019s license for 90 days. Her driving privileges were also \nsuspended for 10 months by the German government, and she was fined. She \nsubsequently participated in an alcohol evaluation in March 2019, and the results \nshowed she did not have any alcohol disorder or any need for alcohol treatment. (Tr. \n20-28; GE 3; AE J)  \nApplicant was also charged with child endangerment by the German police after \nher DUI and accident, because her 13-year-old daughter was in the vehicle. Applicant \nwas arrested by the German authorities and placed in handcuffs, and her daughter \nwas taken into protective custody. Applicant and her daughter were referred to a \ntherapist associated with the family advocacy program. Applicant was investigated for \nchild neglect, and she met with the therapist several times. The therapist also met with \nApplicant\u2019s daughter. The therapist determined that Applicant met the criteria for \nneglect, but concluded that Applicant did not need additional parenting classes or \nalcohol counseling, as her risk level was determined to be low. Applicant reported her \narrest to her supervisor. (Tr. 28-30, 34; GE 3, GE 4; AE K, AE L) \nApplicant\u2019s employer placed her on a performance improvement plan, and in \nJuly 2017, she was placed on administrative leave. In August 2017, she was \nterminated by her employer due to her inability to successfully perform her job duties. \nApplicant and her daughter returned to the U.S., and in about October 2017, she was \nrehired by her former federal contractor employer. (Tr. 33; AE B) \nApplicant met with an authorized DOD investigator in October 2017. The report \nsummarizing the interview was later reviewed and adopted by Applicant as accurate, \nafter she made a few changes to her reported travel. (GE 2) Applicant had extensive \nforeign travel and connections. The DOD investigator questioned her about her foreign \ntravel, foreign connections, and asked her if she had any law enforcement related \nincidents during her time spent overseas. Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d She was \nspecifically questioned whether she had any interactions with law enforcement, either \nforeign or domestic. Again, she provided a negative response. Applicant was then \nconfronted with her December 2016 arrest for DUI, failure to stop at traffic control \ndevice, and child endangerment by the German police. The investigator asked her why \nshe did not initially disclose this information during questioning, and she stated that \nsince the incident occurred in Germany, she did not believe anyone would discover it. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nShe also stated that she did not want the incident to have a negative impact on her \nfuture since she believed if the incident had occurred in the U.S., she would not have \nbeen charged with DUI. (Tr. 42-46; GE 2) \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that she carefully listened to the DOD agent\u2019s \nquestions, and he had only asked her if she had any incidents with U.S. law \nenforcement since the completion of her SCA, which she truthfully responded, \u201cno.\u201d \nApplicant testified that, at the time, she was being interviewed by a \u201cjunior investigator\u201d \nwhile a \u201csenior investigator\u201d observed the interview. Applicant testified that the \u201csenior \ninvestigator\u201d asked her something to the effect of, \u201cWould you like to tell us what \nhappened in Germany?\u201d Applicant then provided the information about her arrest in \nGermany. She did not initially disclose her 2016 arrest during the interview because \nshe was embarrassed by it, and it was also out of character for her. She denied that \nshe deliberately tried to hide the information during her background interview. (Tr. 35-\n41, 62-64)  \nUpon further questioning, Applicant denied ever telling the investigators that \nshe did not disclose her arrest because she did not believe anyone would find out \nabout it since it happened in Germany, or that she did not want the incident to have a \nnegative impact on her future. Applicant made some detailed, specific corrections to \nthe interview summary regarding her foreign travel, however, she did not list any \nmodifications, or even note in the interrogatory these incorrect statements that were \nattributed to her during the background interview. (Tr. 42-49; GE 2) \nApplicant provided four character letters. One of the individuals recommending \nher for a security clearance stated: \u201cShe (Applicant) told me that during an interview \nfor her Top Secret clearance background investigation she misinterpreted the \ninvestigator\u2019s line of questioning regarding the incident which led to the investigators \nbelieving she was being deceptive.\u201d All four individuals stated that Applicant is \ntrustworthy and honest. (AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility.    \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing \nor omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \n \n \nApplicant did not voluntarily disclose her December 2016 arrest in Germany \nduring her background interview in October 2017. There is sufficient evidence to show \nher omission was intentional to support the application of the above disqualifying \ncondition. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant told a co-worker, who then \nprovided her a letter of recommendation, that she had misinterpreted the investigator\u2019s \nquestion, which in turn, caused the investigators to believe she was being deceptive. \nAt the hearing, Applicant said she listened carefully to the investigator\u2019s question, \nwhich only asked if she had any incidents with U.S. law enforcement agencies. These \ninconsistencies are worrisome.  \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s claim that she did not intend to hide this adverse \ninformation is not credible. This is especially apparent after the investigator had just \nquestioned her about her extensive foreign travel and foreign connections, and was \nfully aware of her arrest in Germany. In addition, Applicant listed minor inconsistencies \nabout her foreign travel on the interrogatory, but she failed to list several purported \ninaccuracies in the interview summary report:  1) She failed to note in the interrogatory \nthat the agent had not asked her questions about interaction with law enforcement \noverseas; 2) she failed to note that that she never stated to the investigator that she \nhad hoped the investigation would not uncover her arrest in Germany; and 3) she \nfailed to note that she never stated to the investigator that she failed to disclose the \n2016 arrest because she was embarrassed and did not want it to have a negative \nimpact on her future.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to be upfront and candid about this serious incident in \nGermany was made in the context of a security investigation. Applicant\u2019s deliberate \nomission was recent, and did not happen under unique circumstances. Her intentional \ndeception does cast doubt on her reliability and trustworthiness. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAvailable information shows that Applicant was recently arrested in Germany \nfor DUI. There is no other indication that she has, at times, consumed alcohol to \nexcess. This information reasonably raises a security concern about alcohol \nconsumption that is expressed at AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe facts and circumstances of this case require application of the following AG \n\u00b6 22 disqualifying condition: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nI also have considered the following mitigating conditions available to Applicant \nunder AG \u00b6 23: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s arrest for DUI was an isolated incident. She participated in \nalcohol awareness classes, and overall, she learned a valuable lesson from this \nincident. A recurrence of this alcohol-related incident is unlikely. Mitigating Conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (d) apply. \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the \nfollowing is potentially applicable: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless \nof whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in December 2016, and charged with DUI, failure to stop \nat a traffic control device, and child endangerment. The above disqualifying condition \napplies. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur. The arrest was over two years ago, and was an isolated occurrence \nthat has not been repeated. For similar reasons as set forth in Guideline G, above, \nMitigating Conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. I have considered all the \nevidence, including Applicant\u2019s testimony. She was embarrassed by the adverse \ninformation she was required to disclose during her background investigation. She \nhoped the arrest in Germany would not be discovered during her investigation, and \nshe did not want the arrest to have a negative impact on her future. For these reasons, \nshe deliberately chose to withhold information about the arrest during her background \ninterview. Her lack of candor during the interview is a security concern that calls her \nsuitability for a clearance into question. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s good \njudgment and reliability, as well as her national security eligibility. Because protection \nof the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any  doubts must \nbe resolved against the Applicant and in favor of national security.    \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility.

Karoian, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information in a public trust position is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) effective within the DOD for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006. This decision is based on the adjudicative guidelines \neffective June 8, 2107. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 18, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM) on September 19, 2018. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, \nand it was received on October 1, 2018. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days \n11/30/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nfrom receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not object to the Government evidence and he \nprovided a 33-page response to the FORM. The Government\u2019s exhibits identified as \nItems 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence without objection. The case was assigned \nto me on November 14, 2018.  \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR contains one allegation that Applicant is indebted to DFAS-CL on an \naccount that has been charged off in the approximate amount of $36,230. Defense \nFinance Accounting Service (DFAS) is the sole creditor at issue. Applicant answered \nthis single allegation on June 17, 2018, admitting that he is indebted to DFAS but \ndenying that he has failed to live within his means, to satisfy debts, and to meet his \nfinancial obligations. He also attached a January 20, 2018 three-bureau credit report to \nhis answer.3 After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n                      .    \n \n  \nApplicant is 34 years old. He graduated from high school in 2002 and completed \nsome college courses. He earned a Naval Reserve Officers Training (NROTC) \nscholarship through college from 2002 to 2006, but he did not obtain a degree or take a \ncommission in the military. Therefore, he was required to pay back some of the \nscholarship money pursuant to its terms. He has never been married and reports no \nchildren. He has been employed as a system architect for a federal contractor since  \n2011. Before that, his SCA reflects that he was employed full time in various positions \nsince 2007, with only short periods of unemployment lasting two or three months.  \n \nApplicant reports no military service. He applied for a previous security clearance \nin December 2008, but Defense Security Services (DSS) denied it without explanation \nand the contract ended anyway.  He is applying for a position of trust for the first time. \nHe reported no financial problems in section 26 of his December 2, 2016 Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (Security Clearance Application) (SCA). However, in his \npersonal subject interview (PSI) on January 19, 2018, with an office of personnel \nmanagement (OPM) investigator, he disclosed that he lost interest in military service \nwhile he attended college. He was sent to a peer review board and lost his scholarship. \nHis commanding officer gave Applicant the option of enlisting in the Navy or paying the \nNROTC scholarship money back in accordance with the terms of the scholarship. He \nsurmised that his earlier 2008 SCA was denied because he owed money to Defense \nFinance Accounting Service (DFAS) for the scholarship.5  \n \n  \n                                                          \n2 Unless otherwise indicated, the findings of fact were derived primarily from Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) (Security Clearance Application) (SCA) dated December 2, 2016 \n(Item 3), and his personal subject interviews (PSI) on January 18, 2018, and March 5, 2018 (Item 5). \n \n3 Paragraph 4.3 of this credit report shows that the delinquent debt to DFAS was closed, and Applicant \nhas no new delinquent debts.  \n \n5 Item 5, p. 3. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n            \nIn his June 18, 2018 PSI, Applicant stated that DFAS contacted him in 2007 after \nhe left college. DFAS wanted him to pay $500 per month but he could not afford that \nmuch. No action was taken and Applicant tried to call DFAS twice, but was told that his \naccount could not be found in their system.6 He continued to receive letters from DFAS \nfor about a year and a half, but he ignored them. Then, he heard nothing until 2014.7 He \nnever paid DFAS. \n \n \n \nIn a September 10, 2018 e-mail from Applicant to Department Counsel, he stated \nthat he had conversations with DFAS in 2011 stemming from a letter that he received \nthreatening to move his account to wage garnishment, while his income tax refunds \nwere already being seized and applied to his DFAS debt. (Item 6) He told the DFAS \nrepresentative that he could not afford $300 per month payments as requested. He \nagreed to $225 payments, but could not keep up with them, making only six payments  \nfrom April to November 2011, out of ten that he agreed to make. When Applicant tried to \ncall DFAS to find out his balance, the lady answering the phone tried to look up his \naccount and said he did not have one. So, Applicant stopped paying on this debt. \nApplicant provided no documentation to substantiate these phone calls or any dispute of \nthe debt. He stated \u201cI have the ability to pay the $300/ month, but I cannot in good \nconscience, funnel $300/ month into a website where I have no account, cannot see my \nbalance, and cannot correlate that data to ensure my payment is being applied to that \nbalance.\u201d (Item 6)  \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the FORM on October 11, 2018, and provided \nsupplemental documentation including: three pages of e-mail correspondence with \nDFAS; four favorable character reference letters; five years of positive performance \nreviews (2014 \u2013 2018); a one-page screenshot from pay.gov; and seven pages of \nreceipts from 2011 and 2018 from pay.gov website. The latter receipts reflect six \npayments of $225 to DFAS from February 2011 to November 2011, and one $300 \npayment to DFAS on July 17, 2018. Applicant has documented payments totaling \n$1,650 toward this $36,230 debt that he has known about since 2007.  \n \n \n         \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13 and part \n154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position Categories and Criteria for Designating Positions)  \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \n                                                          \n6 Item 5, p. 3. \n \n7 Item 5, PSI of March 5, 2018.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a [trustworthiness] concern insofar as it may \nresult from criminal activity, including espionage.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding information. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nThe following are potentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant admitted to the single delinquent debt owed to DFAS alleged in the \nSOR totaling over $36,230. This is a longstanding debt, as evidenced by his testimony \nabout the numerous letters he received from DFAS in 2007-2008, and the April 2017 \ncredit bureau report, which reflects that it was opened in 2007, and the last activity \noccurred in November 2011. He admits to ignoring the earlier letters from DFAS in 2007 \n\u2013 2008, and he took no action until 2011. Then, he failed to fulfil the terms of his \nrepayment agreement with DFAS, making only six of the 10 payments he agreed to. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed that he owed a delinquent debt to DFAS in section 26 of his \nSCA. He does not dispute or deny the delinquency, which he was aware of since 2007. \nYet, he produced no documentation to show sustained payments or progress on this \ndelinquent debt aside from the six payments of $225 in 2011, and one payment of $300 \nmade in August 2018 on the eve of the hearing. Then, he just stopped making \npayments based on a putative phone conversation with an anonymous clerk at DFAS.  \nHis efforts were too little, too late. The single delinquency alleged in the SOR is recent \nand ongoing. Arguably, his short periods of unemployment were conditions beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. Yet, he has not demonstrated that he has acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He provided no evidence of financial counseling, good-faith efforts to \nrepay DFAS, or a budget to show that his financial problems have been resolved or are \nunder control. None of the mitigating conditions enumerated above apply.  \n \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed \nunder those guidelines.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a trustworthiness concern. He has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1. a:                                Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a  \npublic trust position.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n     Statement of the Case \nOn July 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant timely answered the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on August 24, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on September 10, 2018, \nand had 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Applicant provided no response to the FORM. The Government\u2019s evidence, \nidentified as Items 1 through 9, is admitted into evidence without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on November 14, 2018.  \n01/29/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He served honorably in the U.S. Army from 1980 to \n1994. Applicant has been employed as a senior systems administrator by a federal \ncontractor since November 2016. He disclosed that he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nprotection in January 2010, in section 26 of his SCA. Applicant had a previous security \nclearance from July 2007. Applicant married in 1980, and he has two adult children.   \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions in April \n1999, discharged in August 2001 (\u00b6 1.a); in January 2010, dismissed in October 2011 \nfor failure to make payments (\u00b6 1.b); and again in April 2012, dismissed in August 2016. \nApplicant admitted all of these filings in his answer to the SOR in August 2018. (Item 2) \nHe also admitted to a mortgage account that is past due (\u00b6 1.d) and eleven medical \ndelinquencies totaling $1,492 placed for collection. (\u00b6 1.e - 1.o) He states in his answer, \nthat with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c, there were arrears owed on his mortgage loan that \ncouldn\u2019t be discharged. On advice of counsel, he voluntarily dismissed the bankruptcy \ncase to try to work out a modification on his mortgage loan. That loan was sold to \nanother company and is now reflected in SOR \u00b6 1.d and it remains delinquent with a \npast-due amount of $30,794. (Item 6) \n \nIn his personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant stated that he fell behind \nfinancially when he took a $25,000 pay cut after leaving his job as a network engineer, \nfrom 1996 to 2008, at a previous employer. He left to look for other employment \nopportunities. He became employed almost immediately as a computer technician. \n(Item 3) All of his creditors listed in his 2010 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, were satisfied \nby 2014 and the bankruptcy case was ready to be discharged, but he could not get a \nmodification on his mortgage loan. He fell behind on mortgage payments, which were \n$768 a month at that time. (Item 4) He was $23,000 in arrears when the loan was sold \nto another mortgagee. Applicant offered no plan for resolving this arrearage.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife fell down and sustained injuries in July 2017. (Item 4) She \nincurred medical bills reflected at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e to 1.o, totaling $1,492, that were \napparently not covered by health insurance. Applicant claims in his answer to the SOR, \nthat he made payments to the creditor on each of these that resolved the alleged debts. \nHe provided confirmation numbers as well, which were not helpful. He provided no \ndocumentation to substantiate his assertions in his Answer and show that these medical \ndebts were resolved.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2010 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case documents include a statement of \ncurrent monthly income and calculations of disposable income.2 This reflects Applicant\u2019s \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s July 26, 2017 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) (Item 3), or his personal subject interview (PSI) on December 19, \n2017. (Item 4)  \n \n2 Item 9. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmonthly gross earnings of $4,948, and his wife\u2019s gross earnings of $1,318. Their \ncombined residuary or disposable income each month was negative $140 in April 2012.  \n \n \nApplicant provided no response to the FORM or evidence that he received \nfinancial counseling. He provided no budget showing income against expenses, or other \ndocumentation to show progress on his delinquent debts. He discussed his wife\u2019s \nmedical care and resulting bills and his intentions to repay these medical debts in his \nPSI in December 2017. He produced no documentary evidence that he has done so \nbeyond the naked assertions in his answer. He provided no character references or \nperformance evaluations.   \n \n \n \n                                       Policies \n \n \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Administrative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful \nweighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and   \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are confirmed by his credit \nreports and answer to the SOR. The Government produced substantial evidence to \nsupport the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c), thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.3 Applicant has not met that burden.  The delinquent debts alleged in the SOR \nhave not been adequately addressed.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant endured a $25,000 pay cut when he voluntarily left his job as a network \nengineer in 2008. Arguably, this condition was beyond his control. Yet, despite his \nknowledge since at least 2017 that the delinquencies alleged in the SOR might affect \nhis eligibility for a security clearance when he completed his SCA, and then reinforcing \nhis intention to make payment arrangements in his PSI, he has done nothing to resolve \nthese accounts. He has produced no relevant or responsive documentation either with \nhis Answer to the SOR, or in response to the FORM. He has not demonstrated that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has the burden to provide \nsufficient evidence to show that his financial problems are under control, and that his \ndebts were incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur.  \n \n                                                          \n3 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s credit report and SOR \nlist the delinquent debts to medical creditors totaling $1,492. Applicant did not provide \nenough details with documentary corroboration about what he did to address his SOR \ndebts. He did not provide documentation relating to any of the SOR debts: (1) proof of \npayments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter \nfrom the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditors; (2) \ncorrespondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of contact;4 (3) \ncredible debt disputes indicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debts and \nwhy he held such a belief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, \nsuch as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve \nthese debts; or (5) other evidence of progress or resolution. Applicant failed to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e) because he did not provide documented proof to \nsubstantiate the existence, basis, or the result of any debt disputes. \n \n \nAside from Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements in his answer, there is no \ndocumentary evidence that Applicant paid, arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or \notherwise resolved the SOR debts. He did not describe financial counseling or provide \nhis budget. The record lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed \nexplanations of the causes for his financial problems and other mitigating information. \nThe FORM advised Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM \u201cin \nwhich to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any \nadditional information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a \ndetermination based solely\u201d on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 3) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n                                                          \n4 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or his] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant served honorably for 14 years in \nthe armed forces. He has gone through an unexpected loss of household income. He \nhas been employed most of his adult life and raised a family. Most importantly, \nApplicant has not addressed the specific allegations in the SOR. Instead, he has made \nuncorroborated representations that he did repay his delinquent medical debts. He has \nlongstanding and ongoing financial problems going back to 1999 when he first filed for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection. His mortgage arrearages have persisted for over five \nyears. He has not met his burden of production.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. He has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.o:               \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

With this job, her salary \nhistory has flourished. After three months of unemployment in mid-2009, she started a \njob earning $45,000 and has received incremental salary increases ever since. She was \ninitially hired in her present position with a salary of $95,000 a year.

The middle child splits time between a school dormitory and Applicant\u2019s home, while \nthe other children reside elsewhere. She has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 11) \nAt issue in the SOR are 12 delinquent debts, regarding which Applicant admits \nresponsibility. Those accounts amount to approximately $36,000 in delinquent debt. \nWith regard to the collection and charged-off accounts at issue in 1.a-1.l, Applicant \nlisted almost all of these debts on her security clearance application (SCA), but only \nbecame aware of a couple of others when she received the SOR. She also stated she \nhas been working with her known creditors, but provided no documentation reflecting \nthose efforts. Applicant admitted she has made little progress due to lack of financial \nresources. (see, e.g., Tr. 33) \nApplicant testified that she has worked on resolving the debt at 1.b for several \nyears and has been trying to work out a payment schedule for the debt at 1.c, but \noffered no documentation to that effect. The creditor at SOR allegations 1.i and 1.j have \nrefused to work out a settlement with her. (Tr. 49-50) No documentary corroboration \nwas provided with regard to these accounts. \nDocumentation, however, was presented showing that the debt for $2,837 at \nSOR allegation 1.e was cancelled by the creditor in 2018. (Ex. A and Ex. C at 2; Tr. 42\u00ad\n43, 56-57). The debts noted at 1.k and 1.l were consequently satisfied by this \ncancelation as they were subsequent collection efforts for that same debt. (The debt for \n$586 noted at SOR allegation 1.l was also disputed successfully. See Ex. F; Tr. 62- 65) \nThe collection entity at 1.g was also cancelled. (Ex. B and Ex. C at 2; Tr. 59-63). Taxes \nare owed on the two cancelled debts and a proposal from the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) was received by Applicant; she responded by stating she could not currently pay \nthe taxes proposed. (Ex. C; Tr. 45) In sum, documentation was only presented \nregarding the two cancellations and the successful dispute that related to SOR \nallegations 1.e, 1.k, and 1.l. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAt one point, Applicant discussed the possibility of pursuing debt consolidation. In \nthe end, she preferred to negotiate and see if she could pay off her delinquent debts by \nherself. (Tr. 67) Helping with the support of her two youngest children and being the \nbreadwinner in the home, Applicant tends to struggle each month meeting her \nobligations. (Tr. 68) Her husband generated scant income. She has no monthly net \nremainder after all bills are paid. Money has been particularly tight since December \n2018, as Applicant converted to telework and reduced hours so she could help with her \nmother, who was recently diagnosed with a rare cancer. Going forward, Applicant hopes \nto continue working with her creditor and trying to \u201csee if they can work something out\u201d \nwith her. (Tr. 74) This is the first time in her life she has had bad credit. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThere are multiple delinquent debts at issue. It appears her buildup of delinquent \ndebt was attributable to expenses exceeding income and, given that some accounts \nhad simply gone unnoticed, neglect. Applicant acknowledged that she has not paid \ndown any of her debt, but has only worked with her creditors. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirect documentation regarding such efforts is scant, and pertain to three \naccounts specifically. An account she testified was disputed was shown as successfully \ndisputed and has since been deleted from her credit report. Two account-related debts \nwere cancelled, although it is unclear these actions were the result of Applicant\u2019s efforts \nor a decision by the creditor. Otherwise, the status of the remaining nine of the dozen \ndelinquent debts at issue remain unchanged. \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. While she has a loosely \nconstructed plan for going forward, she does not have the financial resources at present \nto address the remaining delinquent debts or pay the taxes owed on the two cancelled \ndebts. At best, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in part due to the reduction of delinquent debts at \nissue. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old director of human relations who has been in her \ncurrent position with her present employer for over two years. Her salary has grown \nsignificantly over the past decade year, from about $45,000 to $115,000. She has been \nsteadily employed for the past decade. She is married and has three children. She \nprovides financial support for her middle and youngest child, both of whom are under \n21. Her husband does not significantly contribute to the family coffers, leaving Applicant \nas the breadwinner. This is the first time in her life she has faced such financial distress. \nAlthough uncorroborated by documentary evidence, Applicant has tried to work \nwith many of her creditors since before the SOR was issued. Those undocumented \nefforts, however, have achieved scant success. A dispute she said she made regarding \none account resulted in its deletion from her credit report. Two account balance debts \nwere cancelled, an act that also sated two duplicate accounts. Because money remains \ntight, the taxes on the cancelled debts remain unpaid and Applicant has yet to \nimplement a structured, workable, repayment plan to address the lion\u2019s share of the \ndelinquent debts remaining. \nThis process does not demand that an applicant pay all of one\u2019s delinquent \ndebts. It does, however, expect an applicant to describe a workable and manageable \nagreement and demonstrate by documentary evidence that a meaningful track record of \ntimely and notable payment has been established. Here, Applicant has failed to meet \nthat standard. Moreover, given her current cash flow, it appears unlikely she will be able \nto make more than cursory payments on any of the remaining debts in the near future \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithout significant changes. While some improvement of her delinquent debt situation \nhas been made, they are insufficient to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. As previously noted, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Therefore, \nfinancial considerations security concerns remain existent. \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d, 1.f, 1.h-j:  \nSubparagraphs 1.e, 1g, 1.k, 1l: \n \nAgainst A\n pplicant \nFor Applicant \n     Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Clearance \nis granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective June 8, 2017. The transcript was \nreceived on February 26, 2019. \nThe SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the \nGovernment, DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nclearance. It recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 25, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting all of the \nallegations, except 1.d and 1.e, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me \non November 1, 2018. On January 23, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, \nscheduling the case for February 14, 2019.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel submitted five documents for admission that \nI marked as Government Exhibits (GEs) 1 through 5. Counsel for Applicant objected to \nGE 2, excerpts from a report of investigation, and had no objection to the admissibility of \nthe other exhibits. I sustained the objection to GE 2 and admitted the remaining exhibits \ninto the record. Applicant\u2019s Answer included seven attachments that I marked and \nincorporated into the record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A through AE G.1 \n  \nI took administrative notice, at Department Counsel\u2019s request, of the facts \nencapsulated within four source documents, identified as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I \nthrough HE IV. I also took administrative notice, at Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s request, of the \nfacts contained within three documents, identified as HE V through HE VII.

(GE 1 at 44; AE E at 2) Since \nreturning to the United States in 2007, she has worked at a number of post-doctoral \nfellowships. She is a subject-matter expert on peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and \ncivilian protection. (Tr. 59) Recently, she obtained a realtor\u2019s license. She is working \npart-time as a realtor while her security clearance application is pending.

According to her supervisor with \nwhom she worked at her most recent fellowship, she is a \u201chighly intelligent, diligent \nperson with a high work ethic and great personal and professional integrity.\u201d (Tr. 72-73) \n \n \nIn 2010, Applicant worked as a consultant for a Spanish citizen and Spanish \ngovernment employee. (Tr. 40) She worked in this capacity for six months. After she \nstopped providing consulting services for this individual, she remained in touch, as he \nsometimes provided professional advice and character references. He currently works \nfor a major military alliance. (Tr. 41) She last saw him in 2014. Their last communication \nwas a Christmas greeting exchanged in 2016. Applicant was not an employee of the \nSpanish government when she worked with this gentleman. She worked as a consultant \nfor the U.S. government during the same period. (Answer at 2) \n \n \nIn 2010, when Applicant worked as a consultant for the Spanish citizen, \ndiscussed above, she was acquainted with a person who was working as an advisor to \nthe Spanish foreign ministry. (Answer at 2) After she left her consulting position, they \nremained in touch, texting occasionally. She last saw him in 2017. She has had no \ncontact with him since December 2017. (Tr. 42) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s paternal aunt is a citizen and resident of Spain, and she was an \nemployee of a Spanish ministry. (Answer at 2) She is now retired.

(Answer at 2) \n \n \nWhile Applicant was providing consultant work in Bosnia and Herzegovina, she \nmet a woman who was a citizen and resident of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This woman \nworked as an interpreter. Applicant has not seen her since she met her for lunch when \nher friend visited the United States in July 2016. (Answer at 2; Tr. 44) \n \n \nWhile Applicant was performing consulting work at the Spanish embassy in 2010, \nshe met a Spanish citizen who worked for a Spanish ministry. (Answer at 3) Applicant\u2019s \nlast contact with this individual was an e-mail exchange in 2013. (Answer at 6) \n \n \nApplicant has a friend who is a citizen of Japan and a U.S. resident. When they \nmet, her friend was part of a community of stay-at-home mothers who periodically get \ntogether for play dates with their children, and to share insight into the demands of \njuggling careers with raising children. (Tr. 63) Before taking extended maternity leave, \nApplicant\u2019s friend worked at the Japanese embassy.  Applicant\u2019s friend no longer works \nthere. When she re-enters the workforce, she plans on working at her husband\u2019s \ndentistry practice.  \n \n \nApplicant has an acquaintance who is a citizen and resident of France who works \nfor a French think tank. They met at a workshop in Europe in 2015. (Answer at 4) They \nstayed in touch by e-mail for approximately a year, typically discussing mutual issues \ninvolving balancing careers and raising children. Applicant has had no contact with her \nsince January 2016. (Tr. 47; Answer at 7) \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s assets are in United States. (Tr. 26) She has a realtor\u2019s license \nand her children attend public school. (Tr. 28) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nSpain \n   \n \nSpain is a democracy with a long history of cultural, economic, and political ties \nwith the United States. In addition to being members of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO), defense and security issues are regulated by the Mutual Defense \nAssistance Agreement, and the Agreement on Defense Cooperation, signed in 2015. \n(HE VI at 1-2) Spain is a staunch ally in the fight against terrorism. Many of its security \nforces are deployed in key international missions around the globe. U.S.-Spanish \nbilateral engagement includes more than 70 annual exercises, thousands of ships and \naircraft transiting through Spain, and a robust foreign military sales program. (HE VI at \n2)   \n  \nBosnia and Herzegovina \n \n \nThe United States established diplomatic relations from Bosnia and Herzegovina \nin 1992 following its independence from Yugoslavia. (HE II at 1) A period of conflict \namong rival ethnic groups followed its independence, lasting three years, until 1995. (Id. \nat 1) U.S. involvement was crucial in ending the conflict. Since then, U.S. involvement \nhas centered on strengthening democratic institutions and civil society. Bosnia and \nHerzegovina is a participant in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s Partnership for \nPeace program, and is pursuing membership in the European Union. (HE II at 2) \n \nJapan \n \n \nJapan is one of the most successful democracies in the world. Its alliance with \nthe United States is the cornerstone of U.S. security interests in Asia. (HE III at 1) \nJapanese political and financial support has significantly assisted U.S. efforts on a \nmultitude of global issues, including combating terrorism and working to stop the spread \nof emerging pandemics. (HE III at 1-2) \n \nFrance \n \nRelations with France are active and friendly. (HE IV at 1) France and the United \nStates share common values and have parallel policies on most political, economic, and \nsecurity issues. The United States and France work closely on many issues, most \nimportantly in combating terrorism, and efforts to stem the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. (HE IV at 1) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nSpain, France, and Japan are allies of the United States, with shared values and \nlargely similar geopolitical objectives. The U.S. relationship with Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, though nascent, is friendly. In a world where there are countries openly \nhostile to the United States, countries that brazenly engage in espionage against the \nUnited States, and countries that export terrorism, it would stretch credulity to conclude \nthat that there is a heightened risk that either Spain, Japan, France, or Bosnia \nHerzegovina would strong-arm classified or sensitive information from Applicant through \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion of her foreign colleagues, friends, or \nrelatives. Therefore, I conclude that none of the disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her Spanish aunt who is retired, her Japanese friend, a \nhomemaker living in the United States, and her French acquaintance, who lives and \nFrance and works for a French think tank. Assuming for the sake of argument that either \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) or 7(b) apply, Applicant\u2019s relationship with these individuals is mitigated by \nAG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d I \nresolve SOR subparagraphs 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nThe heightened risk analysis is not limited to the relationship of the country and \nthe United States. The nature of the foreign contacts and the nature of the foreign \ncitizens\u2019 employment must also be considered. ISCR Case No. 17-03026 at 5 (App Bd. \nJan. 16, 2019). Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s relationships with friends who \nhold or have held significant positions in the Spanish government, as alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e, trigger the application of AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nApplicant has had no contact with the acquaintances alleged in SOR \nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.d in three years. She has had no contact with the foreign \nfriend alleged in subparagraph 1.b in two years, and she has had no face-to-face \ncontact with the acquaintance alleged in subparagraph 1.e in nearly ten years, with their \nlast e-mail exchange occurring three  years ago. Applicant has been a U.S. citizen for \nnearly ten years. Her husband and both of her children were born here, all of her assets \nare in the United States. Moreover, she is thoroughly integrated into U.S. culture, \nparticipating in a stay-at-home mothers\u2019 group, and working part-time as a realtor. AG \u00b6  \n8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or \nobligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so \nnominal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d and AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign \ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk \nof foreign influence or exploitation,\u201c apply. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nrelated to the foreign contacts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nGiven the nature of Applicant\u2019s profession, it is axiomatic that she is going to \nwork with individuals who are high ranking foreign government officials. I am confident \nthat she would resolve any potential conflict of interest in the interest of the United \nStates, for the reasons set forth in the discussion of the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He stated that his ex-wife\nobtained the automobile loan in his name (in May 2011).  He stated he was unaware of\n3\nthis delinquency until he was confronted with it during his interview. Similarly, he\nacknowledged that the education loans were his, but stated that he had received no\ndelinquency notices and was unaware of the delinquencies until he was confronted with\nthem during the interview. Nevertheless, he stated his intent to contact the creditors and\narrange payments or otherwise resolve the debts.\nHowever, Applicant has documented no contacts with his creditors since his\nMarch 2018 interview. Moreover, he provided no budget or financial statement. He has\nnot documented any financial or credit counseling. He provided no work or character\nreferences, or any evidence of community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to sensitive information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is\nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case\ncan be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of a position of public trust. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as\na whole, the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nTrustworthiness decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s public trust position. The\nGovernment must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the\nHowever, he did not state that she had done so without his permission. The account was an individual\n3\naccount.\n2\n\nSOR. If it does, the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s case.  Because no one has a right to a public trust position, the applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns. Applicant has $27,000 in\ndelinquent debt for which he has documented no action since at least March 2017.5\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations, \ngiven that he has documented no actions to address his debts. Moreover, his financial\nproblems are recent, frequent, and incapable of assessment since he has provided no\nexplanation about how he came to be so delinquent on these accounts.  He has not\n6\ndocumented that the debts were due to circumstances beyond his control, and his\napparent inaction for nearly two years is certainly not responsible.  Applicant has had no\n7\ncredit or financial counseling, and there is no evidence any of the debts have been, or\nare being, resolved.  Further, his lack of effort cannot constitute a good-faith effort to\n8\naddress his debts.  Accordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\n9\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n5\nof not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . . and there are clear\n8\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n9\nresolve debts.\n3\n\n Formal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Applicant mitigated the \nfinancial considerations concerns raised by his history of financial problems, which \nincludes outstanding federal income taxes and consumer debt. Applicant\u2019s inability to \nresolve his delinquent accounts was caused by events beyond his control. He has acted \nresponsibly in light of his circumstances and has made a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditors. Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 26, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017.  DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \na determination whether to deny his security clearance.  \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. (Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) I) At the hearing, convened on May 1, 2019, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 5 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through G, without objection. After the \nhearing, Applicant timely submitted AE H through N, which are also admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 15, 2019. On August 16, 2019, I \nsent an email to the parties to confirm that the hearing record contained all evidence \nsubmitted at hearing and in post-hearing submissions. The parties certified that the \nevidentiary record was complete. The final exhibit list and the parties certification of its \naccuracy is appended to the record as HE V. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 57, is currently being sponsored for access to classified information by \ntwo federal contracting companies seeking to hire him.  Applicant served in the military \nfrom 1979 to 1999, when he retired as a master sergeant. He served as an Army \nRanger, a Green Beret, a freefall instructor, and an instructor at the Joint Special \nOperations Command. After his retirement, Applicant worked as an employee of a \nfederal contracting company where he was granted access to classified information by \nanother government agency in 2000. He completed his most recent security clearance \napplication in March 2016, disclosing outstanding federal income taxes and five \ndelinquent accounts. The resulting SOR alleges that Applicant owes $100,411 in \noutstanding federal income taxes and $209,252 on three delinquent accounts. (Tr. 21-\n25, 37; GE 1, 2, 4-5; AE A, K.) \n \n \nBetween 2000 and 2009, Applicant lived and worked in State 1. He was \nfinancially secure. He lived within his means, earning sufficient money to support his \nfamily, accumulate retirement savings, and comfortably afford some luxury items. In \nApril 2009, Applicant was laid off. Since then, he has had a sporadic employment \nhistory, experiencing unexpected job losses followed by periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment.  In May 2009, he accepted a long-term consulting job that required \nfrequent cross-country travel between State 1 and State 2. Unable to sell their home in \nState 1 because of the depressed real estate market, Applicant rented out the home. \nFrom April 2009 to January 2010, Applicant, his wife, and daughter used their \nrecreational vehicle (RV) as their primary residence and primary means of cross-country \ntravel. However, in May 2010, Applicant\u2019s employer decided not to renew the contract. \n(Tr. 30-31, 41-42, 108-109; GE 1, 4-5; AE H.) \n \n \nApplicant secured another job in June 2010, working on a five-year contract in \nthe Middle East. The position paid $250,000 annually, which Applicant accepted \nbecause he believed the earnings would ensure his family\u2019s financial security for the \nfuture. However, in December 2012, Applicant\u2019s employer abruptly cancelled the \ncontract and Applicant returned to the United States. Applicant admits that he \nmishandled his federal income tax obligations by failing to properly withhold federal \nincome taxes while he was working abroad, resulting in the tax liability alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a for the 2010 and 2011 tax years. (Tr. 31-32; GE 1; AE H.) \n  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed for six months and used credit cards and his \nretirement savings to support his family. He found employment with a federal \ncontracting company from July 2012 to October 2014. In the two years he held his \nposition, Applicant attempted to rehabilitate his finances. In December 2012, he enrolled \nin a debt-relief program with the intention of resolving $64,000 of credit card debt he \nincurred during his previous periods of unemployment. Applicant settled two credit card \naccounts through the program. He stopped participating in the program after he was laid \noff again in October 2014. (Tr. 32 -33; GE 1; AE H-I.)    \n \nApplicant was unemployed for six months. During this period of unemployment, \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems became acute. In 2015, still unable the sell their home in \nState 1, the bank foreclosed on the property. The mortgage lender cancelled the \nremaining debt. Without any income, Applicant realized he could not afford the \npayments on the RV. Although the account was current, Applicant proactively \nsurrendered the vehicle to the creditor. According to Applicant, the creditor sold the \nvehicle at auction and forgave any deficiency balance. The credit reports in the record \nshows that the creditor charged off the loan balance, $176,062, in March 2015. \nAlthough the loan amount is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, the credit reports show the account \nas having no balance due.  It does not appear that the account was purchased by or \ntransferred to a collection agency. Nor does the record indicate that the creditor has \nmade any efforts to collect any deficiency balance associated with the voluntary \nsurrender.  (Tr. 44-46; Ge 1, 4-5; AE L-M.) \n \n \nIn May 2015, Applicant began working on short-term contracts for a federal \ncontracting company. The contracts lasted a few weeks or a few months, depending on \nthe nature of the work. Although he was earning some income, it was not enough to \nsupport his family. This contracting arrangement continued until November 2018. \nApplicant stated at the hearing that between 2009 and 2015, he accumulated \napproximately $50,000 in credit card debt, including the credit card debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. He also stated that he exhausted his $250,000 in retirement \nsavings, resulting in the 2015 income tax obligation alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, he \nprovided evidence of his efforts to resolve to the alleged accounts. (Tr. 34, 44; GE 1; AE \nM.) \n \nApplicant established an installment agreement with the IRS for the 2010 and \n2011 tax liabilities in 2011. He made is first payment in November 2011 and has not \nmissed a payment. In 2018, Applicant\u2019s CPA filed an amended income tax return for \n2015, which resulted in an $11,476 reduction in tax liability for that year. Applicant \ncurrently owes $14,202 (including $3,121 in penalties and interest) for the 2015 tax \nyear, not $27,329 as alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s current installment agreement \ncovers the 2010, 2011, and 2015 tax years. According to documentation from the IRS, \nApplicant made $100 monthly payments between November 2011 and January 2017. \nThe monthly payment amount increased to $200 between February 2017 and June \n2017. Since July 2017, Applicant has made monthly payments of $291. He continued to \nmake the agreed-upon payments during his periods of unemployment. To date, the IRS \nhas applied these payments to the 2010 balance, which is $45,888 including $25,239 in \n\n \n4 \n \ninterest and penalties. Applicant\u2019s outstanding balance for the 2011 tax year is $52,811, \nincluding $18,226 in interest and penalties. (AE H, J, N.) \n \n \nApplicant opened the credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c in 1987. He attempted to \nresolve the debt through the debt-relief program, but the creditor declined to participate. \nThe account remained open until July 2014, when the creditor closed the account and \nno longer accepted payments from Applicant. The account, which currently has a \nbalance of $4,406, remains unresolved. The creditor holding the account alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d cancelled the debt, forgiving $26,315 in debt in 2015. Because he was \ninsolvent, there was no tax liability associated with the canceled debt. (Tr. 46-48; AE H-\nI, M.) \n \n \nBetween December 2018 and April 2019, Applicant worked as a temporary \nemployee for a small company. He has been unemployed since May 2019. His only \nsource of income is his military retirement and disability pay, which is approximately \n$2,000 each month.  (Tr. 25, 34-35, 49, 73.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18) The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $110,411 in \noutstanding federal income taxes and $209,252 on other delinquent accounts. The \nrecord establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that financial considerations AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) apply. Applicant has demonstrated that he failed to pay his federal \nincome taxes as required for 2010, 2011, and 2015. The alleged delinquent accounts \nalso establish that Applicant has an inability to satisfy his debt and that he has a history \nof not meeting his financial obligations. However, he has presented sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns raised his history of financial problems.  \n \nBefore 2009, Applicant enjoyed financial stability. He lived within his means and \naccumulated significant retirement savings. Applicant\u2019s misunderstanding of his tax \nobligations as U.S. citizen working abroad, resulted in his 2010 and 2011 federal \nincome tax liability. Applicant\u2019s 2015 outstanding tax liability was not caused by \nirresponsible or reckless behavior, but penalties caused by withdrawals from his \nretirement savings, which provided the only source of income during a period of \nunemployment. However, he has been paying his tax liability through an installment \nagreement with the IRS for eight years. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \u00b6 \nAG 20(g) applies.  \n \nA series of employment actions beyond Applicant\u2019s control caused him to lose \nfinancial stability, contributing to his financial difficulties and inability to pay his financial \nobligations. However, Applicant has demonstrated that he has acted responsibly given \nhis circumstances and has demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent \naccounts. Applicant has continued to make payments under his IRS installment \nagreement despite periods of unemployment and underemployment. Between 2012 and \n2014, he participated in a debt-relief program and resolved two non-SOR accounts. In \n2015, he contacted his largest creditor and proactively surrendered the RV he could no \n\n \n6 \n \nlonger afford. There is no indication that he has an outstanding balance with the creditor \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The creditor holding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d cancelled the debt \nin 2015, which Applicant handled appropriately on his 2015 federal income tax returns. \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \u00b6\u00b6 20 (b) and (d), apply. \n \nDespite his actions, Applicant still owes approximately $110,000 in outstanding \nincome taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), and $4,400 credit card debt ($1.c). However, this is \nnot dispositive of his security worthiness. The Appeal Board has held that, \u201can applicant \nis not required to be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately \nor simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009.) Applicant\u2019s \nactions show a track record of debt repayment and his commitment to repaying his \ncreditors.  \n \nBased on a consideration of the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability \nto properly handle and safeguard classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nhave also considered the whole-person factors detailed in AG \u00b6 2(d).  The purpose of a \nsecurity clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts. Rather the purpose is to make \n\u201can examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Here, \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems do not raise any behavior that indicates poor self-control, \nor an intentional unwillingness to follow rules and regulations that may hinder his ability \nto properly handle or safeguard classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.f, which he denied. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old research analyst employed by a federal contractor since April 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 2012 to January 2016. He was unemployed for about one month after being discharged from the Navy.

Plott, Esq. \n09/06/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 14, 2016. On October \n12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 18, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 7, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on February 26, 2019. On March 1, 2019, the \n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for March 27, 2019. Applicant retained an attorney on March 18, 2019, who \nrequested that the hearing be postponed to enable him to prepare. The attorney\u2019s request \nwas granted and the hearing was cancelled on March 19, 2019. On May 8, 2019, DOHA \nnotified Applicant and his counsel that the hearing was rescheduled for June 13, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through M, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open \nuntil July 17, 2019, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely \nsubmitted AX N and O, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on June 25, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 \n1.f, which he denied. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old research analyst employed by a federal contractor since \nApril 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 2012 to January \n2016. He was unemployed for about one month after being discharged from the Navy. \nHe worked in a temporary position for two months before being hired by his current \nemployer. He married in December 2011 and has a four-year-old daughter. He received \na security clearance in July 2012. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, which are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit \nreports from June 2019, September 2018, November 2017, and October 2017. (GX 3-6.) \nThe evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit-card debt charged off for $1,367. This credit card was in \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s name and he was an authorized user. (Tr. 36.) The last payment on the \ndebt was in July 2016, and it was charged off in August 2016. (GX 3 at 2.) Applicant \nsettled this debt for $615 in June 2019. (AX A; A B.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c: student loans past due for $795, with a balance of $8,234; \nand past due for $337, with a balance of $3,747. These loans were approved for \nadministrative forbearance in July 2019. (AX M.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: collection account for $1,267. This debt was reduced to judgment in \nMarch 2018, and it was satisfied in January 2019. (AX E; Tr. 21.) The debt was collected \nin full by garnishment. (Tr. 57.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit-card debt charged off for $4,667. This account was opened \nin March 2012, charged off in October 2017, and settled in June 2019. (GX 3 at 3; GX 5 \nat 3; AX F.)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: collection account for $669. Applicant denied this debt. He testified \nthat he asked the collection agency to identify the original creditor, and it was unable to \nprovide the information. (Tr. 23.) Applicant made no further effort before the hearing to \nresolve this debt, and he had no further communications with the collection agency. (Tr. \n44.) After the hearing, he attempted to obtain information from the collection agency about \nthe identity of the original creditor, but without success. (AX N.) He has not disputed the \ndebt with the credit bureaus. The debt is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, \ndiscussed below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: home-improvement debt charged off for $5,258. As of the date of \nthe hearing, Applicant had contacted the creditor, who agreed to settle the debt for \n$2,200. Applicant is awaiting receipt of an educational grant of $3,000, and he testified \nthat he intends to use to it settle the debt. (Tr. 24, 45.) The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: auto loan debt past due for $190, with a balance of $2,671. \nApplicant made a payment on this debt on June 3, 2019, and the account is now current. \n(AX J.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: dental bill charged off for $668. Applicant testified that this debt and \nthe collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.f are the same debt, but that the collection agency did \nnot comply with a request to identify the original creditor. (Tr. 23.) Applicant admitted that \nhe knew he had debts to a specific dentist for care received by his wife, but he disagrees \nwith the amount claimed by the collection agency. (Tr. 55.) He submitted no documentary \nevidence showing the basis for his dispute and he presented no evidence of direct \ncontacts with the dentist, even though he knows that the dentist is the original creditor. \nHe has not disputed the debt with the credit bureaus. The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: credit-card debt past due for $956 with a balance of $7,242. \nApplicant and his wife incurred this debt to pay for moving expenses and purchases of \nhousehold items after they moved to their current home. They opened the account in \nOctober 2013 and made their last payment in October 2014. (GX 3 at 4-5.)The creditor \nobtained a judgment against Applicant and garnished his pay for about $900 per month. \nAfter the balance was reduced to about $2,000 by garnishment, Applicant settled this \ndebt for $500 in June 2019. (AX C; AX D; Tr. 50.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k-1.m: federal government debts for $4,161; $1,593; and $125. \nApplicant testified that these debts were for GI Bill overpayments, and they were satisfied \nby diversion of his federal income tax refunds, except for $20, which he paid. (Tr. 26.) \nOnce the debts were satisfied, his GI Bill entitlements were reinstated. (AX L.) \n \n \nApplicant provided documentary evidence that three delinquent debts not alleged \nin the SOR were resolved. The creditor for two of the debts is the same creditor as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e. (AX G, H, N, and O.) \n \n \nApplicant earns about $58,000 per year in his current job. In addition, he is a full-\ntime college student, taking classes at night, and he receives GI Bill entitlements of $1,550 \n\n \n4 \n \nper month for housing. (AX K; Tr. 27.) He has not received formal financial counseling. \nHe and his wife use a budgeting application on their computer to track income and \nexpenses. (Tr. 35.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nApplicant was only an authorized user on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and not \nlegally responsible for resolving it. Thus, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.a in his favor.  \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.i are duplicates. When the same conduct is \nalleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have resolved the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e and 1.g-1.m. These debts are sufficient to establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s discharge from \nthe Navy was involuntary and a condition beyond his control. The record does not reflect \nwhether his wife\u2019s dental care was routine or an emergency. On the other hand, the \nexpenses of moving and furnishing a home in order to accept employment at a different \nlocation were conditions largely beyond his control. However, he has not acted \nresponsibly. Even though he has been employed continuously since April 2016, he took \nno significant actions to resolve his delinquent debts until his hearing was imminent. \u201cA \nperson who begins to address concerns only after having been placed on notice that his \nor her access is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when \nhis or her personal interests are not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 15-03696 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, \n2019, citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). \n\n7 \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant has not received financial counseling, \nbut there are \u201cclear indications\u201d that his financial situation is now under control.  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d and most of the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j were satisfied by garnishment. Payment by involuntary garnishment, \n\u201cis not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 09-5700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011), citing ISCR Case No. 08-06058 (App. Bd. \nSep. 21, 2009). Involuntary diversion of a tax refund is similar to garnishment, but the \nevidence indicates that Applicant voluntarily chose to allow the diversion as a convenient \nway of resolving the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.m.  \nAll the debts alleged in the SOR have been resolved except the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g and 1.i. Applicant has promised to pay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g when he receives \na $3,000 grant, but a promise to pay a delinquent debt in the future is not a substitute for \na track record of paying debts in a timely manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. \nBd. Sep. 19, 2008).\nApplicant did not resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.h, and 1.j-1.m until \nhis hearing was imminent. A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Payment of debts motivated by the \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance does not constitute \u201cgood faith\u201d within the \nmeaning of AG \u00b6 20(d). \u201cA person who begins to address concerns only after having been \nplaced on notice that his or her access is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to follow \nrules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. \n15-03696 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019, citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, \n2018).\nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant believes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i is \nfor dental services, but he disagrees with the amount. However, he presented no \ndocumentary evidence of the basis for his dispute, no evidence of efforts to negotiate a \nsettlement, and no documentary evidence that he disputed the debt with the dentist or \nthe credit bureaus. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying nine adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \n\n \n8 \n \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has made significant progress \nin resolving his delinquent debts, but that progress did not occur until his hearing was \nimminent. He has not yet established a track record of financial responsibility. If he \ncontinues on his present course, he may be able to qualify for a security clearance in the \nfuture. See Directive E3.1.38 through E3.1.40 (reconsideration authorized after one year). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.f, and 1.k-1.m: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Her highest level of education is a bachelor\u2019s degree. She is married. (Item 3) On June 4, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing. (Item 3) A subsequent background investigation revealed Applicant had the following issues raised under the financial considerations concern: a federal tax lien entered against Applicant in December 2011, in the approximate amount of $51,434 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 5); a $23,325 federal tax lien entered against Applicant in March 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 6; Item 7; Item 8 at 3), a $6,975 state tax lien entered against Applicant in March 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 4); a $12,526 garnishment order entered against Applicant in January 2017 for a delinquent student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item 11); a $385 medical account placed for collection in August 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 8 at 7; Item 11 at 3).

She has worked for her current employer since January 2015. Her highest \nlevel of education is a bachelor\u2019s degree. She is married. (Item 3) \n \nOn June 4, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing. (Item 3) A subsequent background investigation revealed \nApplicant had the following issues raised under the financial considerations concern: a \nfederal tax lien entered against Applicant in December 2011, in the approximate amount \nof $51,434 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 5); a $23,325 federal tax lien entered against Applicant in \nMarch 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 6; Item 7; Item 8 at 3), a $6,975 state tax lien entered \nagainst Applicant in March 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 4); a $12,526 garnishment order \nentered against Applicant in January 2017 for a delinquent student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d: \nItem 11); a $385 medical account placed for collection in August 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item \n8 at 7; Item 11 at 3). In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c -1.d, and denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.e.  With regard to \nthe tax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant admits she owes the federal tax \ndebts. She disputes the total amount owed. (Item 2)  \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant addressed each allegation as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, federal tax liens in the respective amounts of $51,434 and \n$23,325:  Applicant denies the amounts of the federal tax lien. She states that the \ncurrent amount owed to the federal government is $41,845. She claims the debt was \nincurred because of unsatisfactory service from a former tax representative for tax years \n2006 to 2010. She is current on all tax filings and owes no federal taxes for tax years \nafter 2010. In August 2018, she retained a tax law firm to submit an Offer in \nCompromise on her behalf. The tax debt will be paid in full if the Offer in Compromise is \napproved. She did not provide proof of the current balance of her federal income tax \nsuch as an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) transcript. (Item 2 at 1, 3)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: state tax lien in the amount of $6,975:  Applicant admits this debt. \nShe is currently paying in a monthly installment agreement. She pays $147.73 each \nmonth. It is not clear when the installment agreement began. The balance as of July 30, \n2018, was $6,499. Applicant did not provide additional proof of payments towards the \nmonthly installment agreement. (Item 2 at 1, 4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: $12,526 garnishment entered in January 2017:  Applicant denies this \ndebt because she disputes the $12,526 balance. She claims her wages were garnished \nin the amount of $7,315. She claims she entered a successful loan payment program \nagreement in January 2018. She provided a statement from the Department of \nEducation, dated September 12, 2017, indicating she successfully completed a student \nloan rehabilitation program. Her loan is now being processed for a new repayment \nprogram. She did not provide additional evidence about the repayment program and  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nproof that she is making timely monthly payments towards the program. It is unclear \nwhether the garnishment order was satisfied. (Item 2 at 2, 5)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $385 medical debt placed for collection: Applicant disputed this debt \nwith a credit reporting agency, denying that it was her debt. The debt was successfully \nremoved from her credit report. (Item 2 at 1, 6)  \n \nIn her response to FORM, dated November 1, 2018, Applicant states that she \ncurrently owes the IRS approximately $38,068. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). She provided a \ntyped statement summarizing what she owes for tax years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011. \nIt summarizes her federal tax debts as: \n \n2007 \u2013 Balance $7,811 \u2013 Substitute return filed by the IRS \u2013 Ten year \nStatute of Limitations (SOL) expires on February 11, 2021. \n \n2008 \u2013 Balance $11,170 \u2013 Taxpayer filed return \u2013 SOL expires September \n29, 2022.  \n \n2009 \u2013 Balance $12,099 \u2013 Taxpayer filed return \u2013 SOL expires September \n29, 2022. \n \n2010 \u2013 Balance $7,559 - Taxpayer filed return \u2013 SOL expires September \n29, 2022. \n \n2011 \u2013 Returns not file, but no requirement to file.  \n \nTotal $38,068 (Actually the total is approximately $38,639)  \n \nThe author of the statement is unclear. There is no indication when Applicant \nfiled the tax returns for 2008, 2009, and 2010. She did not file a tax return for 2007.  \nApplicant did not provide the actual transcripts from the IRS, which provide detailed \ninformation about each tax year. Her attorney intends to submit an Offer in Compromise \nfor $2,400. If the Offer in Compromise is accepted, Applicant will pay it in full.  \n(Response to FORM)  \n \nRegarding the $6,975 state tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant claims her \nemployer failed to deduct sufficient state taxes resulting in a tax debt that she could not \nafford to pay in one lump sum. She entered into a repayment agreement with the state \nin 2018. She claims she has met the terms of the repayment agreement. Applicant did \nnot provide receipts or an updated payment history from the state department of \nrevenue verifying that she is making payments or that she satisfied the debt.  \n \nApplicant states that she is now in a payment agreement regarding the student \nloan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and that balance will be paid off by 2020. She did not provide a \ncopy of the payment agreement or proof that payments were being made on a timely \nbasis.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance for over 20 years without any issues. She \nstates she is living within her means and remains current on all financial obligations.  \nShe believes she should be eligible to maintain her security clearance.  \n  \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis   \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f)  failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.   \n  \nAll of the above disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant owes \napproximately $6,975 as a result of state tax lien filed against her in March 2016. She \nalso owes significant federal tax debts for tax years 2007 to 2010, which resulted in tax \nliens being filed against her in 2011 for $51,434 and 2012 for $23,325. Her wages were \ngarnished in January 2017 for a $12,526 delinquent student loan debt. Credit reports \nalso showed a $385 medical collection account.    \n \nThe security concern under Financial Considerations is broader than the \npossibility that a person might knowingly compromise classified information to obtain \nmoney or something else of value. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other important qualities.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raised \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \nfinancial counseling service, and there are clear indications the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the disputes or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial issues are ongoing. She \nis in the process of entering into repayment plans for her federal tax debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n\u2013 1.b) and student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d). She is in a repayment program for her state tax \ndebt. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) It is too soon to conclude that Applicant has demonstrated a track \nrecord of making timely payments towards her delinquent debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply because there were no conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol which adversely affected her finances.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) partially applies because Applicant successfully completed a \nrehabilitation plan regarding her student loan and is attempting to resolve her federal  \nand state tax debts.  However, she ignored her obligations to pay her tax debts for \nyears, which gives this mitigating condition less weight. Applicant did not provide \ndocumentation regarding her repayment plan for her student loan or proof that she is \ntimely making payments towards her student loan. It is too early to conclude that \nApplicant has established a sufficient track record of paying her federal and state tax \ndebts.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies with respect the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant  \nformally disputed the debt and it was removed from her credit report.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies because Applicant appears to be repaying her state \ntax debt. She is in the process of submitted on Offer in Compromise to the IRS.  She \nignored her federal tax debts for years.  She did not hire an attorney to submit an Offer \nin Compromise until August 2018, shortly after the SOR was issued. Her federal tax \ndebt remains unresolved. For this reason, this mitigating condition is given less weight.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s employment history as a DoD contractor for over 20 \nyears. I considered that she is married. While Applicant is in the process of submitting \nan Offer in Compromise regarding the IRS debt, it is premature to conclude Applicant\u2019s \nfederal tax debts will be resolved. A person entrusted with access to classified \ninformation, is expected to follow the duties expected of every U.S. citizen, which \nincludes timely paying federal income taxes. Applicant incurred federal tax debts for tax \nyears 2007 \u2013 2010.  She did not attempt to resolve her federal tax debts until August \n2018, shortly after the SOR was issued.  It is too soon to conclude that Applicant will \n\n \n8 \n \n \nresolve her federal and state income tax debts and her student loan. At this time, the \nsecurity concerns raised under financial considerations are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Based upon a review of the pleadings \nand exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nOn September 10, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. (Item 1) The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.   \n \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 29, 2018, and requested that his case \nbe decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing (Answer). \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nOn February 5, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing seven Items, was \nmailed to Applicant and received by him on March 12, 2019. The FORM notified Applicant \nthat he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not submit a response \nto the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s Items. Hence, Items 1 through 7 are admitted \ninto evidence without objection. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned this case to me on May 29, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he owed a portion of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and \ndenied the remaining amount. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e. \nHe denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old and unmarried. He has a 24-year-old son from a previous \nrelationship. He began his current job with a defense contractor in January 2018. Prior to \nthat he had worked for another defense contractor since April 2017. (Items 4, 5) \n \n \nIn December 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In \nit, he disclosed numerous periods of unemployment: August 2008 through April 2013; \nNovember 2013 to March 2014; July 2014 to October 2014; December 2014 to November \n2015; January 2016 to March 2016; and September 2016 to April 2017. (Item 4) \n  \n \nDuring an April 2018 interview with an investigator, Applicant discussed his periods \nof unemployment. He indicated that after he was laid off from a position in August 2008, \nhe stopped working for several years and traveled around this country on his motorcycle \nwith his girlfriend. He initially used unemployment benefits to support himself during those \nyears, and was subsequently supported by his girlfriend. He also discussed other periods \nof unemployment and his delinquent debts. (Item 5 at 2-6) \n \n \nBased on a credit bureau report (CBR) from January 2018, the SOR alleged eight \ndebts that totaled $52,588. They included unpaid child support arrears totaling $42,542.1 \nThe other seven debts became delinquent between 2015 and 2017, and include unpaid \ncredit cards and medical bills. (Items 6, 7) \n \n \nIn his November 2016 Answer, Applicant stated that he did not owe the entire \n$42,542 child support arrears alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but only $12,901. He said the \nremaining amount is assessed interest (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He indicated this debt became \ndelinquent while he was unemployed. He made no mention of when he would resolve the \ndebt. He stated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e also arose when he was \nunemployed. He said he intended to resolve them. (Item 3) He denied owing the medical \n                                                 \n1 Applicant\u2019s son reached his majority in 2012, so Applicant is no longer responsible for child support. The \nrecord is unclear as to what period of time that the alleged arrears covers. (Item 5) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h because he said he had insurance which he used \nto cover the medical bills.  \n \n \nApplicant did not submit evidence that he paid, resolved, or is resolving any of the \nalleged debts. He did not produce evidence that he is formally disputing them. He did not \nprovide evidence that he participated in financial or credit counseling. He did not provide \na budget or other information related to his financial obligations from which to determine \nhis current financial reliability. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the pertinent AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations of the security concern, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information.2  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has a history of being unable to meet financial obligations, which began \nbefore 2015 and continues to date. The evidence raises security concerns under the \n                                                 \n2 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nabove disqualifying conditions, and shifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or \nmitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and continue to cast doubt on his \njudgment and reliability. Although he stated he experienced periods of unemployment, \nsome of which may have been beyond his control, he acknowledged that after being laid \noff in August 2008, he decided to travel for years rather than work, which was a decision \nwithin his control. He has been fully employed since August 2017. There is no evidence \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has not participated credit \ncounseling or demonstrated a clear indication that the eight alleged debts are under \ncontrol. He has not established repayment plans with any creditors, including the state \nthat manages his child support payments. He disputes the total amount of the child \nsupport arrears, but did not provide proof to substantiate his dispute or evidence of actions \nhe has taken to resolve it. He did not provide sufficient evidence to establish the above \nmitigating conditions.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including those discussed in the \nanalysis of the financial considerations guideline. Applicant is a mature individual, who is \naware of the Government\u2019s security concerns. He was informed after receipt of the FORM \nthat the evidence he submitted in response to the SOR was insufficient to mitigate the \nallegations. Despite that notice, he did not provide additional proof of actions he has taken \nto resolve the delinquent debts. Overall, the absence of evidence creates sufficient doubt \nas to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and suitability for a security clearance. He failed to \nmeet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:   \n    Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",
