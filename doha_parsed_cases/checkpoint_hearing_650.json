    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all but one of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., and 1.f. through 1.h.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as potential findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a photographer with his current employer since May 2018. He previously held the position of head photographer for a company in private industry from May 2005 until the business closed in May 2016. After a period of unemployment, he held the position of laborer for a private construction company from October 2016 until April 2018. His educational background was not revealed. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He has never been married, and he has no children.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/29/2019\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 27, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire For National Security Positions (SF 86). On July 26, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated August 29, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, \nand he elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item \n1) A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 8, 2019, \nand he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. He received the FORM on October 16, 2019. His response was due on November \n15, 2019. Applicant timely submitted one e-mail statement which was accepted without \nobjection.  The case was assigned to me on November 26, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all but one of \nthe factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., \nand 1.f. through 1.h.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as \npotential findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the \nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of \nfact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a photographer with his current employer since May 2018. He previously held the \nposition of head photographer for a company in private industry from May 2005 until the \nbusiness closed in May 2016. After a period of unemployment, he held the position of \nlaborer for a private construction company from October 2016 until April 2018. His \neducational background was not revealed. He has never served with the U.S. military. He \nhas never held a security clearance. He has never been married, and he has no children. \n(Item 2)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated May 30, 2018); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May \n31, 2019); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated January 16, 2019); Item 2 (SF 86, \ndated May 4, 2018); and Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated August 19, 2019).  \nIn his SF 86, Applicant reported \u201ca discrepancy with [his] 2015 taxes\u201d for which he \nmay owe some money; delinquent student loans that he is working on to bring them \n\n3 \ncurrent; and three previously delinquent medical bills that he had already resolved. (Item \n2, at 35-38) During an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in March 2019, he discussed several accounts that had been \ndelinquent, but which he claimed he had resolved well before the interview. Applicant \nreported that he was unemployed from May 2016 until September 2016, and that during \nthat period, he played video games, worked out at a gym, and spent time with friends and \nfamily. He did not mention if he looked for new employment. He was supported by his \nfamily. (Item 3, at 3) He acknowledged that his financial difficulties arose because he was \nunemployed; he had to be hospitalized on two occasions when he had no health \ninsurance; and he did not have that much money. He also candidly said that when he was \nyounger, he did not pay attention to what was going on, he was stupid and not paying \nattention to what was due, when it was due, or how much was due. He claimed that he \nhad changed his ways, and was now paying more attention to his finances. (Item 3, at 7) \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts totaling approximately $38,732, not \nincluding the unspecified amount of unpaid federal income taxes. Those allegations are \nset forth as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.: two student loans with past-due and unpaid \nbalances of $16,750 and $15,258 that Applicant admits are delinquent, but claims he is \n\u201cworking towards getting back on track and up to date.\u201d (Item 6, at 2-3; Item 5, at 1-2; \nItem 4, at 5; Item 1, at 3); SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.f., and 1.g.: three medical debts with unpaid \nbalances of $4,045, $259, and $253 that Applicant admits are delinquent (Item 6, at 1-2; \nItem 5, at 2; Item 1, at 2); and SOR \u00b6 1.d.: a credit-card account with an unpaid balance \nof $1,383 that was charged off that Applicant admits is delinquent (Item 6, at 3; Item 5, at \n2; Item 1, at 2). With regard to the delinquent student loans, Applicant failed to explain \nwhat his efforts were in working towards getting the loans back on track and up to date. \nIn fact, with respect to all of the above listed delinquent debts, he failed to submit any \ndocuments such as his correspondence to his creditors, statements from the creditors, \ncancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to reflect that he \nhad made any efforts to resolve the accounts. In the absence of such explanations and \ndocumentation, I conclude that the accounts are not yet in the process of being resolved. \nIn addition, there is SOR \u00b6 1.e.: an automobile loan with a high credit of $6,399 \nand past-due and unpaid balance of $784 that was charged off. (Item 6, at 3; Item 5, at \n2; Item 4, at 5; Item 3, at 5). Applicant denied that, as of the date the SOR was issued, \nthe account remained delinquent, claiming that he resolved the account in 2017, well \nbefore the SOR was issued. (Item 1, at 2; Item 3, at 5) While Applicant did not submit \ndocumentation to support his position, a review of one of his credit reports indicates that \nhe actually did pay the charge off in September 2017 when he made a payment of $790. \n(Item 6, at 3) The issue was somewhat confusing because the creditor listed in Applicant\u2019s \nearlier credit reports is identified by a specific bank name, but the most recent credit report \nidentified the creditor by its new name following a merger. The account has been \nresolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. refers to Applicant being indebted to the federal government for an \nunspecified amount of unpaid income taxes for the tax year 2015. In his SF 86, Applicant \nstated that he \u201cmay owe some money for [his] 2015 taxes,\u201d and that he would pay the \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \namount owed. (Item 2, at 36): In his Answer to the SOR, and again in his Answer to the \nFORM, Applicant claimed that the debt is being paid off, and that he made a $500 \npayment. (Item 1, at 3) However, Applicant failed to report the amount initially or still owed \nto the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and he failed to submit any documents to reflect \nan IRS acceptance of any installment agreement, or any payment(s) made. In the \nabsence of such information and documentation, I conclude that the income tax debt is \nnot yet in the process of being resolved.  \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is only Applicant\u2019s contention, unsupported by documentation, that he \nobtained financial counseling a decade before he was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in March 2019. (Item 3, at 7) In the absence of additional financial information, \nit remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than \nhe had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to . . . pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts totaling approximately $38,732, not \nincluding the unspecified amount of unpaid federal income taxes. He claimed that he had \ninsufficient funds to maintain his accounts in current status. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) \nhave been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to \nsatisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent student-loan \naccounts, as well as his other delinquent accounts, for several years, make it rather easy \nto conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like it has \nbeen for several years.  \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a four-month period of unemployment \nin 2016; and to his hospitalization on two occasions when he did not have health \ninsurance. He also referred to his failure pay attention to his finances. During his period \nof unemployment, Applicant reported that he did several social things, but did not mention \nif he looked for new employment. He was supported by his family. He claimed that he has \nchanged his ways, and was now paying more attention to his finances. It remains unclear \nif he sought deferment or forbearance of his delinquent student loans.  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline necessary to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed his SF 86 in June 2018; underwent his OPM interview in March 2019; \nthe SOR was issued in July 2019; and he received the FORM in October 2019. Each step \nof the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the significance of the \nfinancial issues confronting him. While he contends he made a $500 payment to the IRS, \nand he claims to have attempted to work towards resolving his delinquent student-loan \naccounts, he failed to submit any documents to support his contentions.  \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is no evidence supported by documentation that \nApplicant has taken any corrective actions with respect to his delinquent student-loan \ndebts, his federal income tax debt, or his other delinquent debts. There are brief unverified \ncomments by Applicant that he took some initial steps to work towards resolving his \ndelinquent student loans, and that he made a $500 income tax payment to the IRS, but \nhe offered no documentation to support his contentions. His contentions regarding the \nstatus of his accounts, and his unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain \nactions, without documents, to support his claims, are insufficient to reflect good-faith \nactions. The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). \n \nThere is no documented evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the \nabsence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, \nunder the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n  \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nphotographer with his current employer since May 2018. He previously held the position \nof head photographer for a company in private industry from May 2005 until the business \nclosed in May 2016. After a period of unemployment, he held the position of laborer for a \nprivate construction company from October 2016 until April 2018. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Although the SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent accounts \ntotaling approximately $38,732, not including the unspecified amount of unpaid federal \nincome taxes, in reality, he had only seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$37,948, not including the unspecified amount of unpaid federal income taxes. He \nclaimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain his accounts in a current status because \nhe was unemployed for a four-month period, and was hospitalized on two occasions when \nhe did not have health insurance. However, as he candidly noted, when he was younger, \nhe did not pay attention to his finances, and he was unaware as to what was due, when \nit was due, or how much was due. Applicant\u2019s description of his activities during his period \nof unemployment is troublesome for he did not mention if he looked for new employment. \nIt remains unclear if he sought deferment or forbearance of his delinquent student loans. \nIt is difficult to assess Applicant\u2019s true financial situation, for we have only Applicant\u2019s \nunverified comments claiming that he had taken certain actions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that he took certain actions with respect to his \ndelinquent student-loan accounts and his federal income tax debt, with the exception of \nthe one previously resolved delinquent automobile debt, there is no documentary \nevidence to indicate that any of his delinquent accounts have been addressed. Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent track record is poor at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG \n2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f. through 1.h.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His request for a security clearance is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn April 12, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \nclearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2.  \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn May 17, 2019, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that \nraise security concerns articulated in the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the \nDirector of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Specifically, this case is governed by Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology). \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. With \nhis response, he proffered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 I. I received the case on \nNovember 25, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on January 30, 2020. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant appeared as \nscheduled, testified, and proffered AX J \u2013 Q. All exhibits were admitted without objection. \nI received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 10, 2020. \n \nProcedural Note \n \n \nAX Q is a report from a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) who conducted an \non-line evaluation of Applicant on January 29, 2020. The author also is a certified \nsubstance abuse counselor (CSAC), a master addiction counselor (MAC), and a \nsubstance abuse professional (SAP). In her report, she made certain clinical findings \nabout possible mental health disorders Applicant may have had. In so doing, the LCSW \nalso referenced the disqualifying and mitigating factors listed under Guideline D (Sexual \nBehavior), which is not at issue in this case, and she presented certain observations and \nconclusions about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. (AX Q at page 5) I have \nconsidered the author\u2019s qualifications and her clinical findings as part of the record \nevidence as a whole. However, her qualifications do not include experience in the \nadjudication of DOD security clearance matters. Even had she established such \nqualifications, in DOHA proceedings the ultimate conclusion about an individual\u2019s \nsuitability to have access to sensitive information is the sole province of the administrative \njudge. Accordingly, I have not considered the author\u2019s specific conclusions about \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline M, the Government alleged that in November 2016, Applicant was \nfired for using a company laptop to view pornography between June and November 2016, \nin violation of his employer\u2019s policy for acceptable use of company information technology \n(SOR 1.a). This conduct was cross-alleged as adverse personal conduct under Guideline \nE (SOR 1.b). In response to the SOR, Applicant denied, with explanations, both SOR \nallegations. (Tr. 8 \u2013 9) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old and employed since January 2019 as a program manager \nfor a defense contractor. He served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps \nbetween 1993 and 1995, when he was honorably discharged after becoming physical \nunable to serve any longer. Thereafter, Applicant worked and attended college, earning \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nan associate\u2019s degree in 1999 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. In August 2012, he \nearned a master\u2019s degree. (Answer; GX 1; AX F) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have been married since 2005 and have two children under \nthe age of 10. His wife also works for the same defense contractor (Company A) where \nApplicant was employed between May 2015 and November 2016 as a project manager. \n(GX 1; Tr. 25 \u2013 26) \n \n \nApplicant has worked in the defense industry since 2003 for five companies \nincluding Company A. He first received an industrial security clearance in 2004. \nThroughout his career, Applicant has received training, usually on an annual basis, on a \nvariety of security-related topics. Company A records show that on June 1, 2016, he \nacknowledged receiving training in cyber security and on Company A policies regarding \nthe proper use of company computers and information technology systems. (GX 1; GX 4; \nTr. 8) \n \n \nOn June 8, 2016, Applicant accessed a pornographic website from his company \ncomputer while at his permanent worksite and while connected to the company network. \nThis occurred when Applicant connected a personally-owned external hard drive to his \ncompany computer. During a subject interview in September 2018, and in response to \nthe SOR, Applicant claimed that while reviewing the files stored on that hard drive, he \ninadvertently clicked on the link for a pornographic website and that this was an isolated \nincident. Although Applicant was allowed to connect the hard drive to his work computer, \naccessing that website was a violation of company policy. When he clicked on the link, a \nsecurity notice appeared on his screen advising him that he had been detected \u201cmaking \nrepeated attempts to visit improper websites with a classification branded for \ninappropriate material.\u201d The incident occurred on a Wednesday, but Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor was not in the office until the following Monday, June 13. Applicant claims he \ntold his supervisor that day of the incident and that it was an inadvertent, one-time event. \nHe further claimed that his supervisor did not formally counsel him, but advised Applicant \nto avoid such websites in the future. Applicant interpreted management\u2019s response as \ntacit permission to his use of pornography sites, even on a company laptop, as long as it \nwas not during work hours or while connected to a company network. On Tuesday, June \n14, 2016, the manager of the Company A information security department notified \nApplicant that he again had been detected accessing inappropriate sites on his company \ncomputer on Monday, June 13, 2016, the same day he purportedly self-reported his \nearlier conduct to his supervisor. Applicant\u2019s supervisor also was advised of this and \nApplicant was warned that \u201ccontinued inappropriate activity will initiate a full security \ninvestigation, possible seizure of [his company laptop] for forensic analysis, and further \nreport (sic) to HR and the Information Systems Security Officer.\u201d Applicant was also \nprovided with a link to Company A\u2019s \u201cSecurity Information Technology Acceptable Use \nPolicy.\u201d (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4; Tr. 26 \u2013 29, 32 \u2013 33) \n \n \nApplicant continued to view pornography using his Company A laptop on at least \nthree other occasions between June 2016 and November 2016. Applicant admits doing \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nso, but he insisted that he was off-duty each time and was not connected to the company \ninformation network when he accessed pornography sites. Applicant has further claimed \nthat he was not made aware of the Company A policy against using the laptop in that \nway. Most of Applicant\u2019s conduct in this regard occurred while Applicant was away from \nhome on work-related travel overseas. Despite this, Company A\u2019s information security \norganization detected numerous websites and an extensive level of activity, some of \nwhich involved sites that reflected an interest in underage girls. Applicant denied that he \never viewed child pornography. He acknowledged that he has viewed pornography for \nseveral years. The LCSW evaluation on January 29, 2020 found no disorder or \ncompulsion associated with Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant has also acknowledged that \nhe understands the cyber security vulnerabilities that can arise when one accesses \nwebsites such as those at issue here. He insists that he has learned his lesson, and his \nwife has stated her confidence that Applicant no longer views pornography. (GX 1 \u2013 4; \nAX P; AX Q; Tr. 26 \u2013 30, 47 \u2013 57) \n \n \nApplicant presented five character reference letters, four of which indicated \nApplicant had disclosed the reasons why his security clearance eligibility was in doubt. It \nis not apparent, however, that Applicant disclosed all of the facts about his misuse of a \ncompany laptop to view pornography. He also presented information that shows he has \nbeen an excellent employee in terms of his performance and technical expertise. His \ncurrent employer has, so far, given him positive feedback about his performance over the \npast year. (Answer; AX A \u2013 E; AX G; AX H; AX N; AX O) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \n \nUse of Information Technology \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 39: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n \n \nThe record evidence as a whole shows that Applicant repeatedly violated \nCompany A policies regarding acceptable use of his company laptop. He did so with full \nknowledge of those policies within days of receiving company training on that subject. He \nalso repeated his behavior after being specifically warned that such conduct would have \nsignificant consequences if he persisted. He eventually lost his job as a result of his \nmisconduct. This information is most directly addressed in the first sentence of AG \u00b6 39, \nabove, but also requires application of AG \u00b6 40(g) (negligence or lax security practices in \nhandling information technology that persists despite counseling by management). \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 41 mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and  \n \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \n \n \nThe events at issue occurred nearly four years ago and Applicant claims he has \nlearned his lesson about the need to properly use information technology. He also now \nacknowledges that he acted as alleged in the SOR; however, in response to the SOR and \nat his hearing, he stated that he was not properly trained or advised about Company A \npolicies or the security concerns posed by accessing pornographic websites. These \nclaims are directly at odds with the persuasive information contained in Company A \nrecords about these events. Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible, and his inconsistent \nstatements about his conduct undermine confidence that his past conduct no longer casts \ndoubt on his judgment and reliability. The AG \u00b6 41 mitigating conditions cited above are \nnot applicable and the security concerns under this guideline are not mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant violated Company A policies about the use of his company laptop. He \ndid so despite knowing it was against company policy and after being warned that \ncontinued violations would result in serious consequences. When Applicant told his boss \nabout the June 8 incident, he misled him by saying his access was a one-time inadvertent \nevent; however, the day he had that conversation with his boss, he repeated his \nmisconduct and was more formally cautioned against future misuse of his laptop. \nAvailable information shows Applicant continued his misconduct for the next five months \nuntil he was fired. He was given several opportunities to correct his behavior, which he \nfailed to do. This information requires application of AG \u00b6 16(c): \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \n \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \nDuring his background investigation, in his response to the SOR, and at his \nhearing, Applicant again claimed that his access was either inadvertent or was somehow \nacceptable. The weight of these claims shows that he has not been candid about what \nhe did and that he has not yet accepted responsibility for his actions at Company A. Even \nin the absence of similar conduct over the past four years, Applicant\u2019s inconsistent \nresponse to the security concerns reasonably raised by this information continues to \nundermine confidence in his judgment and reliability. The AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions \ncited above cannot be applied here, and the security concerns raised under this guideline \nare not mitigated. \n \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). I particularly note the value of Applicant\u2019s military service and the positive \ninformation about his work in the defense industry. Nonetheless, Applicant\u2019s inconsistent \ntestimony about his conduct creates persistent doubts about his judgment and reliability. \nBecause protection of the interests of national security is the principal focus of these \nadjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the Applicant\u2019s request for \nclearance. \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to \nhave access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted some of the SOR allegations, with explanations, and denied other allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old. He is currently unemployed, but he is being sponsored for a security clearance by a federal contractor. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 2013 to 2019, when he was discharged with a general discharge, under honorable conditions. He holds an associate degree and is taking additional courses. He is divorced and has no children. He held a clearance while in the Air Force until it was suspended in December 2018. (Tr. 6, 37-38; GE 1, 6) Under Guideline I, the SOR alleged: (1) Applicant received psychiatric treatment for depression and anxiety in November 2018. He expressed suicidal ideations while hospitalized; (2) Applicant received treatment at a military medical clinic from December 7, 2018, to about April 22, 2019, after expressing suicidal ideations. He was diagnosed with conditions identified as adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and an unspecified personality disorder. He was given a poor prognosis.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 6, 2023, and the hearing was held as \nscheduled on March 1, 2023. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s pre-hearing discovery \nand exhibit list were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. At the Government\u2019s request \nand without objection, I took administrative notice of certain excerpts of the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), as set forth in HE III. \nApplicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-E, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant\u2019s transmittal email was marked as HE IV. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on March 9, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted some of the SOR allegations, with explanations, and denied \nother allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He is currently unemployed, but he is being sponsored \nfor a security clearance by a federal contractor. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 2013 \nto 2019, when he was discharged with a general discharge, under honorable conditions. \nHe holds an associate degree and is taking additional courses. He is divorced and has \nno children. He held a clearance while in the Air Force until it was suspended in December \n2018. (Tr. 6, 37-38; GE 1, 6) \nUnder Guideline I, the SOR alleged: (1) Applicant received psychiatric treatment \nfor depression and anxiety in November 2018. He expressed suicidal ideations while \nhospitalized; (2) Applicant received treatment at a military medical clinic from December \n7, 2018, to about April 22, 2019, after expressing suicidal ideations. He was diagnosed \nwith conditions identified as adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood \nand an unspecified personality disorder. He was given a poor prognosis. He was \nevaluated by a licensed psychologist in December 2021, who affirmed the earlier \ndiagnoses of mood disorder and adjustment disorder, and also characterized his \nprognosis as poor. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged: (1) Applicant received nonjudicial punishment \nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Article 15, in February 2019 for \nwrongful use of testosterone; (2) Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under the \nUCMJ, Article 15, in April 2019 for wrongful use of letrozole; (3) Applicant was charged \nwith engaging in abusive sexual contact under UCMJ Article 120; and (4) Applicant \nreceived a general discharge from the Air Force in May 2019.

The \nSOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false information on his August 2019 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) when he failed to disclose: (1) his hospitalization in \nNovember 2018; (2) his illegal drug use in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b above; (3) his illegal drug use, \nwhile possessing a security clearance; and (4) that he had his security clearance \nsuspended in December 2018. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.e) \nPhycological Conditions (Guideline I). \nApplicant was interviewed by a background investigator in August 2019. During \nthat interview, he admitted that he sought treatment for anxiety and depression and was \nhospitalized at a military facility in November 2018. He sought this treatment after he had \nmoved out from living with his girlfriend in October 2018. He remained hospitalized for \napproximately 36 hours. Applicant admitted this hospitalization during his hearing \ntestimony. There are no medical records that document this hospitalization. There is also \nno evidence supporting Applicant\u2019s suicidal ideations at this point in time. (Tr. 54-56 ; GE \n2 (p. 6), GE 4 (no reference to November 2018 hospitalization)) \nApplicant voluntarily sought outpatient counseling at an Air Force mental health \nclinic from approximately December 2018 to May 2019. The treatment stopped when he \nwas discharged from the Air Force in May 2019. His medical care during this time is \ndocumented by the 120 pages of records contained in GE 4. Applicant\u2019s primary mental \nhealth provider during his sessions was Dr. C, a licensed clinical psychologist. Applicant \nhad one session with Dr. K, a psychiatrist. (GE 4 (pp. 14, 45-50, 112)) \nDr. C\u2019s initial diagnoses for Applicant in December 2018 were: (1) adjustment \ndisorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (DSM-5 F43.23), and (2) unspecified \ndisorder of adult personality and behavior (DSM-5 F69). During the course of the next \nseveral months, Dr. C continued to see Applicant in the clinical setting and documented \nthe following observations: \nApplicant\u2019s first session on December 7, 2018: He was hostile and \nuncooperative with treatment. He made little eye contact, which challenges \nhis credibility. A personality disorder is suspect of interfering with his \naccessibility to treatment. He is scheduled for psychological testing. \nApplicant\u2019s session on December 14, 2018: He was uncooperative with \ntreatment and would rather talk about himself, he related he felt victimized \nby a woman who raised a sexual assault allegation against him (see below \nunder criminal conduct discussion). He seems unwilling to engage in any \nauthentic therapeutic interventions; \nApplicant\u2019s session on December 17, 2018: He may be opening up but it is \nhard for him to let go of blaming his girlfriend; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s session on December 27, 2018: He is forming tenuous\ntherapeutic alliance after each session after he initially enters with a hostile,\nirritable attitude. Once he opens up he impresses as more credible and\nempathy for him comes easier. He is beginning to talk  more authentically\nabout his conflicts and feelings of aloneness. He has not had suicidal\nideations for at least a month. \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s session on January 4, 2019: He did not enter session with \nhostility. He talked a lot about himself. He opened up about growing up with \nguns and they are a part of his culture. He expressed that no one ever being \nthere for him and this statement might offer an opening into his personal \nlife. \nApplicant\u2019s session on January 11, 2019: He presents for the supportive \naspects of treatment and tends to become argumentative when he is \nchallenged. He seems to be disinterested in real change that can come from \npsychotherapy. However, his symptoms have reduced dramatically since \nhe has presented himself as a victim regarding the sexual contact  \nallegations. He is unauthentic and he is not aware that he is presenting that \nway; \nApplicant\u2019s session on January 14, 2019: He wants to come off his \nmedications because he feels he is underweight. He is more focused on his \nappearance than on his current emotions. He is opening up to some degree \nin therapy and is gaining some minimal insight into how his own behavior \nhas affected his current situation. He is very focused on the women who \nhave wronged him. He wishes to continue treatment, despite his resistance \nto it; \nApplicant\u2019s session on February 22, 2019: He panicked over his sexual \nassault charges, so his reading of one [Dr. C\u2019s] notes in which he was \ndeemed not credible has weighted meaning at this time. He stated that if he \nlost his sexual assault case he would kill himself. He also called his mother \nand told her the same thing. He is contradictory in his reports of confirming \nat the same time denying his suicidality. (Note, on this same day, Dr. C was \ninformed by Applicant\u2019s First Sergeant that Applicant had a plan to kill \nhimself with a gun if he was not discharged from the Air Force in 15 days. \nApplicant had written a suicide note.); \nApplicant\u2019s session on March 15, 2019: He is completely disengaged from \ntreatment, is argumentative, and cannot be pleased.  \nApplicant\u2019s session on April 22, 2019: He attended therapy today despite \nhis complaint that his treatment is lacking. He seemed lost and spoke as if \ntreatment was his last resort. He presented well-groomed and confident as \nusual but he seems confounded about why he is alone and what needs to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbe done to remedy his feelings of loneliness.

He has been off his \nmedications for two months. This was the last session Applicant attended \nbefore his discharge from the Air Force. (GE 4 (pp. 33-37)) \nDr. C\u2019s final diagnosis was that Applicant presented with adjustment disorder with \ndepressed mood and anxiety. She summarized his overall progress during his sessions \nas follows: \u201cPatient did not improve in treatment and was only checking in because he \nrefused treatment but he was on the HIL (high interest list) and was required to check in.\u201d \nHe did not have suicidal ideations at the beginning or the end of his sessions. She also \nstated his prognosis is poor and that Applicant was unreliable and dishonest during the \ncourse of treatment. (GE 4 (pp. 12-14) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he denied that he expressed any suicidal ideations \nwhile treated at the Air Force mental health clinic between December 2018 and April \n2019. He also explained that he believed the prescription medication he was taking was \ncausing \u201cnegative feedback.\u201d In his hearing testimony, Applicant admitted he had a \ndifficult relationship with Dr. C. He believes she took things out of context. He also \ndisagreed with the medications she prescribed for him. He denied telling Dr. C that he \nwould kill himself if he lost his sexual assault case. He denied telling Dr. C that he called \nhis mother and told her the same thing. He denied writing a suicide note that his First \nSergeant disclosed. I do not find Applicant\u2019s denials credible when viewed against the \nconflicting record evidence. (Tr. 77-78, 89-91; SOR answer) \nIn December 2021, Applicant consented to a psychological evaluation arranged by \nthe DOD. Dr. M, a board certified, licensed clinical psychologist, approved by the DOD, \nwas retained to conduct the evaluation on December 4 and December 21, 2021. Dr. M \nconducted clinical interviews of Applicant, reviewed the medical records contained in GE \n4, reviewed Applicant\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical records, and \nconducted psychological testing, including The Million Clinical Multiaxial Inventory 4th \nedition (MCMI-IV) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 3rd edition \n(MMPI-3). (GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s MCMI-IV test produced a profile of a response style in need of social \napproval with a tendency to present himself in a favorable light. The testing results \nshowed significant elevations on scales related to histrionic, turbulent, and narcissistic \npersonality patterns. The test showed that he also expressed general anxiety. The test \nindicated evidence of a moderate degree of emotional lability in his personality, and \nalthough he is typically able to function adequately, periods of marked emotional, \ncognitive, and behavior dysfunction are likely. (GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s MMPI-3 test showed that the test\u2019s validity scale raised concerns about \npossible underreporting by him. However, the test was deemed valid. He presented as \nwell-adjusted, despite evidence to the contrary. The test revealed he likely engages in \ncompulsive behavior and displays a rigid, perfectionistic demeanor.

(GE 3) \nBased upon her overall evaluation, Dr. M concluded, \u201c[Applicant] has a consistent \nhistory of Mood Disorder and Adjustment Disorder, and although he does not currently \nendorse any mental health symptoms, it is likely that he is minimizing due to the nature \nof this evaluation.\u201d Dr. M gave the following prognosis: \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] prognosis is poor. \nHe lacks insight into his mental health condition, and he is unable to admit even minor \nflaws.\u201d Additionally, she stated that the inconsistencies between Applicant\u2019s self-report of \nhis mental health history and his current condition contrasted to the documented \ntreatment history call into question his judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness. \n(GE 3) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant indicated that at the time of Dr. M\u2019s evaluation he \nhad been off his anti-depressant medications for about six months. Without stating it \ndirectly, he implied that this had some impact on him at the time of the evaluation. He \ndenied suffering from bi-polar mood disorder, however, Dr. M did not specifically diagnose \nhim with that disorder. She stated that without further testing (a neuropsychological \nevaluation), the diagnostic picture was complicated. He has seen a therapist through the \nVA two times in the past year. He provided some medical records from the VA, but none \ncontained any diagnoses or prognosis. He does not have any future sessions scheduled. \n(Tr. 115-116; GE 3; AE D; SOR answer) \nCriminal Conduct (Guideline J) and Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse\n(Guideline H) \n \nIn October 2018, while Applicant was in the Air Force, he tested positive for \ntestosterone, a schedule III controlled substance, during a urinalysis test. Further \ninvestigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) discovered three \nwitnesses who either saw Applicant inject himself with testosterone or other steroids, or \nto whom Applicant admitted that he used such substances. A residential search revealed \nthat Applicant possessed a box of unused 31-gauge syringes and a vial of bacteriostatic \nwater. Based upon the foregoing, in January 2019, Applicant was administered Article 15 \nUCMJ proceedings by his commander for a violation of UCMJ Article 112a, wrongful use \nof a controlled substance. After consulting with a lawyer, Applicant accepted the Article \n15 proceedings, rather than requesting trial by court-martial. After making a written \npresentation to his commander, his commander found him guilty of the offense and issued \npunishment of a one grade reduction-in-rank and a reprimand. (GE 2, 7-8) \nIn January 2019, Applicant tested positive during another urinalysis for letrozole, \nanother controlled substance. Applicant was again offered Article 15 punishment, which \nhe accepted. His commander found him guilty of the offense and issued punishment of a \none grade reduction-in-rank and a reprimand.

(Tr. 69-70, 72; GE 2; SOR answer)  \nIn February 2019, Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend reported to the AFOSI that when \nshe and Applicant were living together in October 2018, he touched her in a sexual \nmanner on three occasions. She claimed she told him to stop on each occasion. Applicant \nwas later questioned by the AFOSI and he denied any nonconsensual touching. The \ninvestigation was forwarded to Applicant\u2019s command for potential criminal action. The \ncommand decided that there was insufficient evidence to act upon. During his hearing \ntestimony, he denied this allegation. Additionally, he claimed he was a victim of sexual \nassault by his former girlfriend. (Tr. 45-48; GE 10) \nApplicant was discharged from the Air Force in May 2019, at the end of his \nenlistment. His discharge was characterized as a general discharge, under honorable \nconditions. (GE 1-2) \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \nApplicant filled out an SCA in August 2019. In Section 21 of the SCA, he was asked \nif he had ever been hospitalized for a mental health condition. He answered \u201cno.\u201d \nApplicant admitted he was voluntarily hospitalized in November 2018, for a 36-hour period \nin a behavioral health facility. He claimed in his SOR answer that it was not related to \nmental health issues. Earlier during his background investigation, he admitted the \ntreatment was for anxiety and depression issues. He told the investigator he was not sure \nhe should list it. (Tr. 55-56, GE 1-2; SOR answer) \nIn Section 23 of the SCA, Applicant was asked if, within the last seven years, he \nhad used any illegal drugs or controlled substances. He was also asked if, within the \nsame time period, he used illegal drugs or controlled substances while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. He answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions. That answer was false because \nApplicant was used illegal steroids between July and October 2018 and December 2018 \nand January 2019. He held a security clearance at the time of these uses. In Section 15 \nof the SCA, Applicant listed information about his military history. In the subsection \ninquiring about discipline, Applicant disclosed his discipline under Article 15 for positive \ndrug tests. This is similar information that should have been disclosed in Section 23, as \ndescribed above. (GE1) \nIn Section 25 of the SCA, Applicant was asked if he ever had a security clearance \neligibility/access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked?

She stated that \nwhen they started dating in May 2020, he disclosed a mood disorder to her resulting from \nthe death of his fianc\u00e9e in January 2020. He was taking medication at that time. After \nabout a year, he decided to come off his medications. After doing his own research, he \nstopped taking the prescribed medications. She further stated that since coming off the \nmedications, he is a new man. She feels coming off his medication was the best choice \nfor him. (AE A-B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\u00ad\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of seeking mental health counseling.   \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nApplicant was voluntarily hospitalized in approximately November 2018 for a 36-\nhour period. In December 2018 he began regular sessions with a qualified mental health \nprofessional (Dr. C) at a military mental health clinic. During these sessions, Applicant \nspoke of committing suicide on more than one occasion. There is no evidence that he \nhad any suicidal ideations while hospitalized in November 2018. He was diagnosed by \nDr. C with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. She gave him a \npoor prognosis and opined that he was unreliable and dishonest during his treatment \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsessions. In December 2021, a second qualified mental health professional diagnosed \nApplicant with mood and adjustment disorders, gave him a poor prognosis, and indicated \nhis treatment history called into question his judgment, reliability, stability, and \ntrustworthiness. All three disqualifying conditions apply here. \nThe adjudicative guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns, as set forth in AG \u00b6 29: \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;   \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant testified that he has had two therapy or counseling sessions in the past \nyear through the VA. The VA records do not contest the earlier diagnoses of Dr. C and \nDr. M. Applicant is no longer taking medication. Based upon the totality of the record \nevidence, none of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \nand  \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\"Honorable.\" \nThe record evidence supports the allegations describing Applicant\u2019s acceptance \nof Article 15 punishment from his commander for two separate violations of using illegal \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndrugs. The alleged victim of Applicant\u2019s sexual assault provided evidence supporting that \nallegation. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c are established under AG \u00b6 31(b). Since Applicant\u2019s discharge \nfrom the military was characterized as general, under honorable circumstances, I find that \nSOR \u00b6 2.d was not established under AG \u00b6 31(e) \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b because his illegal \nsteroid abuse was recent and he continues to deny that he knowingly used the illegal \nsubstances, thereby limiting any rehabilitation effort. He failed to present credible \nevidence indicating he would not use these substances in the future. Given that \nApplicant\u2019s commander evaluated the evidence concerning the alleged sexual assault \nand recommended no criminal proceedings, I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 \n2.c. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The potentially applicable condition in this case is: \n(a) any substance misuse.  \nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal controlled substances is supported by two positive \nurinalysis tests, witness testimony, and the seizure of syringes. AG \u00b6 25(a) is established.  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s denial that he wrongfully used steroids, given the evidence supporting \nhis knowing uses, and his use while holding a security clearance, cast doubt upon his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or 26(b) \napply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine national; and  \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe record evidence is sufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal \nconduct and drug involvement and substance misuse guidelines. Nevertheless, as a \nwhole, Applicant\u2019s actions put into issue his judgment, trustworthiness and overall \npersonal conduct, as expressed in the general security concern in AG \u00b6 15 and the \nspecific concern expressed in AG \u00b6 16(c). Applicant\u2019s use of illegal steroids while holding \na security clearance raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 15 and AG \u00b6 16(c) apply to SOR \u00b6 4.a (related to 2.a-2.b). \nApplicant was aware that he was hospitalized for mental health reasons in \nNovember 2018. I do not find credible his assertion that he was not sure if he needed to \nlist that information on his 2019 SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 4.b. I conclude that \nalthough Applicant failed to list his steroid use under Section 23, he did provide essentially \nthe same information about that activity in Section 15 of the SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.c-4.d. Applicant admitted providing erroneous information about never \nhaving his clearance suspended. In December 2018, he signed for a copy of the letter \nsuspending his clearance and therefore had actual notice of something significant that \noccurred less than one year before he completed his August 2019 SCA. I conclude his \nomissions were deliberate. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 4.e. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal steroids after he was granted a security clearance causes \nsignificant concerns. He was well aware of his responsibilities to disclose his \nhospitalization and his clearance suspension in 2019 when he completed his SCA, but \nhe failed to do so. He did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his previous \nfalsifications. Deliberately providing false information on an SCA is not a minor offense. \nIt strikes at the heart of the security clearance investigation process. These actions raise \nquestions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), \nand 17(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s mental health \nissues, his military service, and his letter of support. However, I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s diagnoses and prognosis concerning his mental health issues, his history of \nsteroid abuse, and his use after obtaining a security clearance. He also deliberately \nfalsified his 2019 SCA. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines I, J, H and \nE. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except the \nlanguage, \u201cYou expressed \nsuicidal ideations while \nhospitalized,\u201d which I find in favor \nof Applicant) \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b, 4.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.c-4.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of six exhibits. (GEs 1-6) \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit AE A). The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on July 7, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with updated payment information. \nregarding the debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. For good cause shown, Applicant \nwas granted 14 days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded two \ndays to respond, Within the time permitted, Applicant furnished documentation covering \nhis payment efforts regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions \nwere admitted without objections as AEs B and E. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated five delinquent \ndebts exceeding $40,000. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved \nand outstanding. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) was arrested in June 2018 and \ncharged with public lewdness for masturbating on a public walking trail, thereby \ncommitting a sexual act in public, for which he pleaded guilty and received six months\u2019 \ndeferred adjudication and a fine of $429; (b) falsified material facts during a September \n25, 2021 personal subject interview (PSI) with a DoD investigator, when he told the \ninvestigator the public lewdness charges were limited public urination; (c) unlawfully \nchoked an individual with his hands, for which he received a record of non-judicial \npunishment (NJP) (inclusive of reduction of grade and 45 days of extra duty) (d) \ncommitted an Air Force disciplinary infraction in March 2004, when he failed to pay the \ndebts he owed the Air Force and received a letter of reprimand in April 2004; and (f) \ncommitted an Air Force disciplinary infraction in November 2001 when he made a false \nofficial statement with the intent to deceive, for which he received a record of non-\njudicial punishment (inclusive of reduction in grade). \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations pertaining to \nhis finances with explanations and clarifications. He claimed he had made monthly \npayments to four of the SOR creditors and could not find one of the listed creditors \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) in his credit reports. He further claimed that he exercised poor judgment in \nconnection with his handling of each of his listed accounts. Addressing the multiple \nincidents cited under Guideline E, he admitted all of the allegations with explanations \nand clarifications.

Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in August 1998 and divorced in August 2007. (GE 1) He \nremarried in July 2008 and divorced in December 2018. (GE 1) He has three children \nfrom this marriage. (GE 1) He married for the third time in August 2019 and has two \nstepchildren from this marriage. (GE 1) Applicant attended college classes at various \ninstitutions between January 1999 and August 2001 without earning a degree or \ndiploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in the Air Force in March 1992 and served 12-plus years of \nactive duty before receiving a general discharge under honorable conditions in October \n2004. (GE 1 \nSince August 2017, Applicant has worked for his current contractor as a quality \nassurance inspector. (GEs 1-2) Between 2010 and 2017, he worked for other \nemployers. As a civilian, he has held a security clearance since June 2006. (GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nCiting financial difficulties associated with his divorce from his second wife in \n2018, and improvident spending by his first wife, Applicant accumulated a number of \ndelinquent accounts (six in all) between 2013 and 2019, exceeding $40,000 in the \naggregate. The SOR-listed debts are comprised of the following: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (an \nindividual account opened in 2013 to finance a vehicle with a reported post-\nrepossession balance of $12,699); 1.b (an individual account opened in 2013 to finance \na $15,000 vehicle with a reported post-repossession balance of $9,140); 1.c (an \nindividual account opened in 2017 with a reported current balance of $3,316); 1.d (an \nindividual account opened in 2017 with a reported current balance of $10,225; and 1.e \n(an individual account opened in 2018 to finance a vehicle purchase with a reported \npost-repossession balance of $8,554). \nWhile Applicant has made sporadic payment progress with several of his SOR \ncreditors, he has failed to follow through with documented good faith payments and \npayment plans with his creditors since his debts became delinquent. (GEs 4-5; Tr. 60-\n65) Promised receipts of payments to these creditors never materialized. Claiming to \nhave a payment agreement with SOR creditor 1.d, the documentation supplied by \napplicant does not match any of the creditor information covered in his credit reports. \nCompare the information covered in AE A with the compiled credit bureau data in GEs \n4-5.         \nBased on the documentation furnished by Applicant, none of the delinquent \ndebts covered by the SOR can be credited to Applicant as either favorably resolved or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n     \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                              \n \n               \n \n                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin the process of being favorably resolved. Each of Applicant\u2019s listed SOR accounts \nremain in delinquent status. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest, Air Force disciplinary  infractions, and PSI omissions  \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 arrest and multiple disciplinary infractions over the course of his \nAir Force career are considerable. While in the Air Force, Applicant committed multiple \ndisciplinary infractions, for which he received NJP. They are documented  as follows: a \nfalse official statement with intent to deceive in November 2021, for which he received a \nreduction in grade; engagement in a sexual relationship with a subordinate between \nJuly and August 2002, for which he received a reduction in grade and forfeitures of \n$500 pay per month for two months and 45 days of extra duty; unlawful choking an \nindividual with his hands, for which he received a reduction in grade and 45 days of \nextra duty; and failure to pay debts owed the Air Force for misuse of a Government \ncredit card in March 2004, for which he received a letter of reprimand.GE 6) \nRecords document that in April 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with \npublic lewdness for masturbating on a public walking trail (a sexual act in public). \nAppearing in court to answer the charges, he pleaded guilty and received six-months of \ndeferred adjudication and a fine o $429. (GEs 3-4) \nIn a September 2021 PSI with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), Applicant was asked to describe the incident involving his 2018 \npublic lewdness arrest and charge. (GE 2) Responding to the investigator\u2019s inquiry, \nApplicant characterized the charge as limited to public urination. (GE 2) In his own \naccount of the incident, he failed to disclose the charged conduct and ensuing guilty \nplea covering his masturbating in public. Applicant\u2019s withholding of material information \nabout the details of his arrest and conviction from the investigatory constituted knowing \nand willful withholding of material facts about his arrest, charges, and ensuing guilty \nplea. (GEs 2-4) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. When evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the \nrelevant guidelines are to be considered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of \nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

Of special interest a \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative and adjudicative processes. . . AG \u00b6 15. \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.

Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

These debt delinquencies warrant the application \nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited divorce as a contributing source of his debt delinquencies \naccrued during his marriage reflects some extenuating circumstances beyond his ability \nto manage and control; although all of hte listed SOR accounts were opened individually \nin his name. Considering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s added \nfinancial burdens mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s to \nsituation. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent accounts once the issues associated \nwith his 2018 divorce and judgment lapses had passed prevented him from taking \nadvantage of the full benefits of MC \u00b6 20(b). Because he has not demonstrated enough \nexercise of financial responsibility following his divorce, he is not in position to take full \nadvantage of the second prong of MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cacted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.\u201d Without more demonstrated effort in addressing his major debts, most \nof whom stem from deficiency balances following the repossessions of three of his \nautomobiles, Applicant remains short of meeting the minimum eligibility requirements for \nholding a security clearance. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020).

Applicant\u2019s presented history of arrests, disciplinary infractions, and candor \nlapses, for which he failed to timely correct, warrant the application of two DCs of \nGuideline E. DCs \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information, \nconcerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical or mental health professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to \na national security eligibility determination, or other official government representative\u201d; \nand DC 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information, fully apply to the facts and \ncircumstances covering Applicant\u2019s situation. \nConsidered together, Applicant\u2019s history of multiple disciplinary infractions \nincurred during his 12-plus year Air Force career, his lewdness arrest with a deferred \nadjudication, and his candor lapses about the details of his public lewdness incident \nwhen questioned by an OPM agent in a PSI conflate to create material questions about \nhis overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. None of the mitigating \nconditions potentially available to Applicant are applicable. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions, the \nextenuating circumstances associated with his divorce, the current state of his finances, \nand the judgment lapses associated with his with Air Force infractions, more recent \npublic lewdness arrest and guilty plea, and the misleading information furnished the \nOPM investigator in his 2021 PSI, insufficient evidence has been presented to enable \nhim to maintain sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding \na security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nand personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.

(Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j, 1.l-1.p, 1.r, and 1.s. \nHe denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.q. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 1.k, Applicant claimed that he filed his federal income tax \nreturn for tax year 2012,and the Government did not provide sufficient documentation to \nestablish this allegation. For SOR \u00b6 1.q he claimed that he had a payment plan to resolve \nhis state tax debt. He provided a letter from the state tax commission stating that he does \nnot have any outstanding liabilities for his account. These two tax issues are resolved. He \ndid not provide documentation for any of the other SOR allegations. (Answer; AE A) \nIn his Answer, Applicant stated that his financial troubles started in 2008 when his \ndaughter became pregnant in college. She moved home and he supported her and his \ngrandson for four years. He did not state how much support she required, why she was \nunable to contribute to their household during those years, or in what specific way this \nimpacted his finances.

He started his next job with a government contractor in \nSeptember 2011. He claims that he has not been able to pay his creditors because of \ngarnishments on his income and levies on his bank account. He claims that he is working \nwith a tax service to set up a payment plan with the IRS. (Answer; Items 3, 10) \nIn his Response to the FORM, Applicant admitted that he has made poor \ndecisions, but says that they do not define his character. He asserted that he did not have \nany bills listed as delinquent on a recent credit report that he obtained, but he did not \nsubmit a copy of that report. The most recent credit report in the record shows that he is \nstill actively using his credit cards. The report shows that he has 16 revolving accounts, \nwhich have over a $21,000 balance combined. He stated that in the past, he has gambled \nto increase his income. He has not had any counseling for gambling, but claims he has \nstopped through prayer and church attendance. He did not provide any other evidence \nthat supports this claim. He reports that he has recently paid off his first and second \nmortgages. He asserts that he plans to pay off all of his debt. (AE A; Item 4) \nApplicant submitted a character letter that states that he is a respectable \nemployee, is a valuable asset, and is not a threat to national security. (Answer) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file \ntax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \nand \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to fund \ngambling or pay gambling debts. \nThe SOR allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record \nevidence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(f) and 19(h) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s unpaid and delinquent debts are recent, \nongoing, and unresolved. He did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that the debts \noccurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. These financial issues cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat his unpaid and delinquent debts occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. He did not provide sufficient evidence showing that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. While he has recently been able to pay off his first and second \nmortgages on his home, he has not made any documented payments on his federal tax \ndebts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant has not submitted sufficient documentation \nshowing that he has received financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source \nfor his unpaid or delinquent debts, his tax issues, or his gambling problem. There are not \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. He reported that \nhe had a serious gambling problem and that it was one of the main causes for his financial \nproblems. However, he did not provide sufficient evidence to find that he no longer \ngambles. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.q. It does not apply to any of the other tax-\nrelated SOR allegations. He has known about his tax debts for many years, and he has \nnot made any documented effort to resolve them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). I considered his employment history, military service, and character \nletter. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his unpaid taxes, delinquent judgments and \ndebts, and excessive gambling. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

She was unemployed from June to November 2019, while caring for her mother. She was a federal employee from November 2019 to August 2022. She was hired by her current employer, a defense contractor, in August 2022. She has held an interim clearance since November 2020. (Tr. 27.) Applicant was enrolled in college courses from an online university from July 2011 to July 2014 and from April 2020 to the present. She does not yet have a degree.

She was a \nfederal employee from November 2019 to August 2022. She was hired by her current \nemployer, a defense contractor, in August 2022. She has held an interim clearance \nsince November 2020. (Tr. 27.) \nApplicant was enrolled in college courses from an online university from July \n2011 to July 2014 and from April 2020 to the present. She does not yet have a degree. \nShe is not married and has no children. \nApplicant testified that her financial problems began when she was arrested in \nOctober 2014 for driving under the influence. Although the charge was reduced to \nreckless driving, she incurred about $8,000 in legal expenses. (Tr. 16.) Her self-\nemployment was not as profitable as she expected. Her student loans went into default, \nand she fell behind on credit-card payments and the loan for her motorcycle. (Tr. 18.). \nWage and income transcripts from the IRS reflect the drastic reduction in her income \nduring her period of self-employment. (AX C, D, and E.) \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from July 2021 \nand November 2020 (GX 2 and 3). The evidence related to the debts is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f: student loans totaling $46,135. In February 2020, Applicant \nentered into a rehabilitation agreement providing for $5 payments for 12 consecutive \nmonths. (AX H.)

She was scheduled to begin payments in January 2021, but \npayments were deferred in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic \nSecurity (CARES) Act. (AX H; Tr. 22.) \nThe CARES act provided for automatic forbearance and zero interest charges \nduring the forbearance. This student-loan debt relief was extended several times. Most \nrecently, it extended to permit the Department of Education to implement a debt-relief \nprogram, which is under litigation. Loan payments will restart 60 days after the debt-\nrelief program is implemented or the litigation is resolved.1  Appellant\u2019s student loans \nwere current when the forbearance went into effect. Her student loans are not \ndelinquent. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h: credit-card accounts charged off for $3,717 and $2,157. \nThe debt for $3,717 was charged off in August 2020 and the debt for $2,157 was \ncharged off in October 2020. (GX 3 at 4.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that she was \nmaking monthly payments of $300 on each of these accounts. (Tr. 36.) She did not \nsubmit documentation of payments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: personal loan charged off for $2,035. This debt was charged off in \nAugust 2020. (GX 3 at 5.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that this debt was paid in \nfull. (Tr. 37.) She did not submit any documentation of payment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: telecommunications account placed for collection of $1,105. In \nOctober 2020, Applicant made a payment agreement providing for six monthly \npayments of $122.87. (AX F.) At the hearing, she testified that it was paid in full. (Tr. \n38.) She did not submit any documentation of payment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: credit-card account charged off for $808. This debt was charged \noff in October 2020 (GX 3 at 6.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that she is willing to \npay this debt but has been unable to do so because she cannot find out who owns it. \nShe testified that she disputed the debt electronically and it was removed from her \ncredit record. (Tr. 40, 61.) However, the debt is still reflected in the July 2021 credit \nreport. (GX 2 at 4.) She did not submit any documentation of her dispute or its \nresolution. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: credit-card account placed for collection of $1,575. Applicant \ntestified that she paid this debt with the proceeds of the loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. (Tr. \n41.) The debt was charged off in March 2016 and is reflected as disputed in the July \n2021 and November 2020 credit reports. (GX 2 at 4; GX 3 at 6). Applicant did not \nsubmit any documentation of payment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: personal loan charged off for $2,417. Applicant testified that she \nincurred this debt to buy a motorcycle, that her mother gave her the money to pay the \ndebt, and that it was paid off when she sold the motorcycle. (Tr. 43.)

After the hearing, \nshe submitted a screen shot of state motor vehicle records showing that she owned the \nmotorcycle and that the license plate would expire in August 2023. (AX G.) She argued \nthat the motor vehicle records show that she sold the motorcycle, but her evidence does \nnot support her claim that the motorcycle was sold. (AX A at 3.) Furthermore, even if \nshe sold the motorcycle, she presented no evidence showing that the proceeds of the \nsale were used to pay off the personal loan. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: medical debt placed for collection of $718. This debt was placed \nfor collection in October 2020. (GX 3 at 6.) Applicant testified that she incurred this debt \nwhen she went to an urgent care facility while she was unemployed and without medical \ninsurance. She testified that this debt has been paid. (Tr. 45.) She did not submit any \ndocumentation of payment. However, the debt is not reflected on the July 2021 credit \nreport. Because the debt is too recent to have aged off her credit record under the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act, its absence from the credit report suggests that it was resolved. \nApplicant testified that her current salary is about $9,000 per month, which is \nabout $3,000 more than her salary for her previous job. She has about $500 in savings \nand $2,600 in her retirement account. Her monthly rent is $1,800. She has a ten-year-\nold car that she bought in 2019, and her payments on the loan are $414. She has a \nmonthly remainder of $200 to $300 after paying all her expenses. She plans to travel \noverseas in the summer and has budgeted $6,000 for the trip. She testified that she has \na financial counselor, and she uses computer software to track her expenses. (Tr. 46-\n54.) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor has known her for 10 years. He submitted a letter stating \nthat she has been selected for multiple special assignments because of her character \nand willingness to help. He states that she has left a positive impact and improvement \non every assignment. In addition to her work, she has \u201cvolunteered for more causes and \nmentored more people than [he] can list.\u201d (AX B.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The failure of Applicant\u2019s business, the illness \nof her mother, and her illness while she was unemployed and without medical insurance \nwere conditions largely beyond her control. However, she has not acted responsibly. \nShe has been employed continuously since November 2019. She has acted responsibly \nregarding her student loans, but she has not submitted documentary evidence of \nresponsible conduct toward the other debts alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant testified that she has a financial \ncounselor, but she provided no evidence showing that her counselor is \u201ca legitimate and \ncredible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service,\u201d and, except for her \nstudent loans, she has not submitted evidence that her financial problems are under \ncontrol. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f and the \nmedical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g-1.m. Although Applicant testified that these debts were resolved or were being \nresolved, she submitted no documentation of payments or payment agreements. \nApplicants who claim that debts have been or are being resolved are expected to \npresent documentary evidence supporting those claims. ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant testified that she disputed the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k, but she provided no documentation of the basis for the dispute or \nits resolution. She has not disputed any of the other debts alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2002 until he was discharged with a bad conduct discharge in 2017. He has worked for defense contractors since 2017. He has an associate degree earned in 2017. He is single with four children. (GE 3-5, 9) Applicant was an E-7 in 2014 when he committed the offenses that resulted in multiple charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The charges, for violations of Article 90 (disobey lawful order of commissioned officer); four specifications of Article 92 (fail to obey general order: fraternization); Article 107 (false official statement); and three specifications of Article 128 (two specifications of assault by battery, and one specification of aggravated assault), were referred to a general court- martial. (GE 3-5, 9, 10) In 2015, pursuant to a pretrial agreement, Applicant pleaded guilty to all of the charges and specifications, except the aggravated assault specification, to which he pleaded not guilty. He pleaded guilty to the two assault specifications by unlawfully touching the victim. He was sentenced to reduction to E-1, confinement for six months, and a bad conduct discharge.

He has an \nassociate degree earned in 2017. He is single with four children. (GE 3-5, 9) \nApplicant was an E-7 in 2014 when he committed the offenses that resulted in \nmultiple charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The charges, for \nviolations of Article 90 (disobey lawful order of commissioned officer); four specifications \nof Article 92 (fail to obey general order: fraternization); Article 107 (false official \nstatement); and three specifications of Article 128 (two specifications of assault by \nbattery, and one specification of aggravated assault), were referred to a general court-\nmartial. (GE 3-5, 9, 10) \nIn 2015, pursuant to a pretrial agreement, Applicant pleaded guilty to all of the \ncharges and specifications, except the aggravated assault specification, to which he \npleaded not guilty. He pleaded guilty to the two assault specifications by unlawfully \ntouching the victim. He was sentenced to reduction to E-1, confinement for six months, \nand a bad conduct discharge. His pretrial agreement limited his confinement to 120 \ndays and his reduction to E-4. (GE 3-5, 9) \nApplicant described the offenses during his background interview and in his \nresponse to the SOR. He admitted to having inappropriate relations with four junior \nservicemembers. He described the assaults: \nI got in an argument with a [servicemember] I was seeing at the time and \nshe grabbed my truck keys and would not give them back so I grabbed \nher by the wrist and opened her hand to get them so I could leave and it \nbruised her wrist. Another time [we were] having consensual sex and I \ngrabbed her a bit too hard and rough and I left bruises on her that way. \nApplicant admitted that he lied during the investigation into the charges, stating, \u201c[t]he \nonly reason I lied was because I was so scared of what might happen to me and my \n[military] career.\u201d He stated that the Article 90 occurred because his commanding officer \n\u201cwas messing with [his] platoon and wanted them to do unsafe acts and [Applicant] told \nhim no in a not so respectful manner.\u201d That is an inaccurate description of the charge. \nThe charge was actually a violation of an order for Applicant to have no contact with one \nof the servicemembers involved in the fraternization. (GE 3, 9, 10) \nApplicant was unemployed for about 18 months after his court-martial. He was \nlikely on unpaid appellate leave after his release from confinement until his discharge \nwas approved in 2017.

He stated that he would continue his attempts to reach the creditor \nand resolve the debt. (GE 3, 5-8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a delinquent debt of $5,014 for a military exchange credit \ncard. When he was interviewed for his background investigation, Applicant incorrectly \nstated that he thought the debt was for a military travel credit card, and the debt should \nhave been erased or forgiven because it was incurred while he was in the military. He \nwrote in his response to the SOR that his wages are being garnished $100 per month \nuntil the debt is resolved. He did not submit any supporting documentation. (GE 3, 5-8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a delinquent debt of $1,786 to a collection company on behalf \nof a financial institution that specializes to loans to military servicemembers (different \ncollection company and different financial institution than alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 1.e). When he was interviewed for his background investigation, Applicant \nincorrectly stated that he thought the debt was for a military travel credit card, and the \ndebt should have been erased or forgiven because it was incurred while he was in the \nmilitary. He documented that he entered a payment arrangement with the collection \ncompany in March 2022 to resolve the $1,786 debt by an initial payment of $50, \nfollowed by 17 recurring payments of $50, and a final payment of $36 in September \n2023. He did not provide proof of any payments. (GE 3, 5-8) \nApplicant admitted owing the $1,289 delinquent debt to an appliance store (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e). He stated that he made arrangements with the creditor to pay $50 per month \nuntil the debt is resolved. He submitted a loan statement from the creditor dated March \n16, 2022, but no evidence of any recent payments. (GE 3, 5-8) \nApplicant stated that he was current on the $456 delinquent debt to a bank (SOR \n\u00b6 1.f).

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct resulted in a general court-martial conviction and a \nbad conduct discharge. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and 31(e) are applicable \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution,\ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nThere is a direct correlation between Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and whether he \nshould hold a security clearance. In addition to the assaults, he violated orders on \nnumerous occasions, and he lied in an attempt to cover up his crimes. He was \nuntruthful during his background interview and in his response to the SOR when he \ndescribed one of the offenses. It has been more than eight years since the criminal \nconduct. Nonetheless, I have unmitigated concerns. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above mitigating conditions, \nindividually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified the SF 86 when he failed to report his \ndebts under the following specific question: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? \nIt is unclear why this was the only question alleged when there were other \nquestions that were more appropriate. In order to find a falsification under this specific \nquestion, the Government must prove by substantial evidence that Applicant had debts \nthat were turned over to a collection agency; that he knew that he had debts that were \nturned over to a collection agency; and that he intentionally failed to report that he had \ndebts that were turned over to a collection agency. The Government did not prove that \nApplicant was aware when he submitted the SF 86 that he had debts that were turned \nover to a collection agency. There is insufficient evidence to establish that Applicant \nintentionally falsified the specific question alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \napplicable to that question. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b cross-alleges the criminal conduct resulting in the general court-\nmartial conviction. Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not \nperfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under the criminal conduct guideline. However, the general concerns \nabout questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable to the false \nofficial statement made during the investigation into the charges. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nUnder the same rationale discussed above for criminal conduct, Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his unemployment after his court-\nmartial conviction. That came because of Applicant\u2019s misconduct. It was not largely \nbeyond his control. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant did anything about his finances until he \nreceived the SOR. The timing of ameliorative action is a factor that should be brought to \nbear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who begins to resolve \nsecurity concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in \njeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his \nor her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant provided documentation of some payment agreements, but no actual \npayments. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect \napplicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at \n3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). He indicated that he intended to resolve his debts. Intentions \nto resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). The medical debts and the small insurance debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, \nand 1.k) have minimal security significance, and they are mitigated. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, and F, and J in my whole-person analysis. Applicant lied in the military in \nan attempt to avoid punishment, and he has been less that completely forthright in the \nsecurity clearance process. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct, financial considerations, and criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 29 years old and recently married with one child. He has a high school diploma. He is employed by a defense contractor as a mariner and seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Government Exhibit 2 at 2; Tr. 7-8, 26-28.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR specifically alleged that Applicant has three debts that were charged off, or in collection, in the total amount of approximately $60,919. (SOR 1.a through 1.c.) He admitted SOR allegation 1.c with an explanation. He denied allegations 1.a and 1.b, stating that he had paid those debts in 2015. The existence and amount of the debt in SOR allegation 1.c is supported by Applicant\u2019s admission in his Answer.

The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an Amended Notice of Hearing on October 14, \n2022. The case was heard on November 8, 2022. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe hearing on November 18, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibit \nA, which was also admitted without objection. He asked that the record remain open \nuntil December 2, 2022, for the receipt of additional documentation. No further \ndocumentation was received from him, and the record closed on December 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 29 years old and recently married with one child. He has a high \nschool diploma. He is employed by a defense contractor as a mariner and seeks to \nretain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Government \nExhibit 2 at 2; Tr. 7-8, 26-28.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nspecifically alleged that Applicant has three debts that were charged off, or in collection, \nin the total amount of approximately $60,919. (SOR 1.a through 1.c.) He admitted SOR \nallegation 1.c with an explanation. He denied allegations 1.a and 1.b, stating that he had \npaid those debts in 2015. \nThe existence and amount of the debt in SOR allegation 1.c is supported by \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his Answer. All three debts are confirmed by credit reports \nsubmitted by the Government dated December 20, 2019; April 17, 2020; August 6, \n2021; and June 24, 2022. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.) The existence of the \ndebts is also supported by his answers on Section 26 of his e-QIP (Government Exhibit \n1) and during an interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement on June 29, 2020.

(Government Exhibit 2 at 3; Tr. 60\u00ad\n62.) \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant denied owing Credit Union A $13,519 for account One. That debt \nwas charged off. \n1.b. Applicant denied owing Credit Union A $25,207 for account Two. That debt \nwas charged off. \nThe above debts will be discussed together for convenience. Applicant admitted \nthe existence of both of these debts but maintained that he had paid them in 2015. In \nsupport of that statement he provided loan documents from Credit Union B as the \nAttachment to his Answer. The Attachment shows that his aunt cosigned a $50,000 loan \nwith him from Credit Union B in May 2015. \nApplicant Exhibit A consists of two checks dated May 30, 2015, drawn on Credit \nUnion B and made payable to two different accounts with Credit Union A. Applicant \nstated that he had asked Credit Union A for a pay-off figure on the two subject accounts \nin the SOR. After he received the figures, he had Credit Union B make out the checks. \nThe checks were actually made payable to two other accounts Applicant had with Credit \nUnion A at the same time. A check for $18,815.85 was made out for Credit Union A, \naccount Three. A second check for $24,464.43 was made out for Credit Union A, \naccount Four. The credit reports show that accounts Three and Four have been paid. \nThe same reports show that accounts One and Two remain unpaid and charged off. \n(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7; Tr. 31-32, 57-59.) \nUpon reviewing the Government\u2019s exhibits before the hearing Applicant \ndiscovered the apparent mistake and went to discuss the situation with Credit Union A \nshortly before the hearing. According to him, a teller at Credit Union A showed him that \nthe debts alleged in the SOR were actually two additional unpaid debts that he owed at \nthe same time in 2015-16. This was confusing to him, and he informed the teller that he \nwas still unsure of which accounts were his and that Credit Union A appeared to have \nadditional money of his that was unaccounted for. The teller informed him that she \nwould look into the situation and get back to him. As stated, he was given additional \ntime to provide evidence as to his financial situation, including any information from \nCredit Union A, and no additional information was provided. Based on the available \nevidence, I find he has not paid or otherwise resolved either of these two debts. (Tr. 29\u00ad\n44, 49-50.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing $22,193 for an account that has been charged off. \nThe credit reports in the record show that this account was opened in 2016 and he \nstopped paying on the debt in 2017.

He was not able to provide any \nadditional information showing that this debt had been paid or otherwise resolved. \n(Answer; Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8; Tr. 44-49, 53-56, 59-60.) \nApplicant testified that his current financial situation is stable. He realizes his \nfinances can affect his security worthiness but has not yet taken the initiative to \ndetermine how he can reduce or pay off his past-due indebtedness. (Tr. 50-53, 60.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has three large debts that were charged-off in the total amount of \napproximately $60,919. He has not made any recent payments on these debts, and has \nno current plans to make payments on these debts. These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has not mitigated the security significance of his past-due \nindebtedness. These debts have been in existence for many years. I have considered \nhis statements that he paid off allegations 1.a and 1.b in 2015. However, he has not \nsupported that statement with evidence from Credit Union A, despite my giving him time \nto provide it. He has very little knowledge of the situation regarding the debt in allegation \n1.c. There is little to no evidence that he has behaved responsibly under the \ncircumstances, as required by AG \u00b6 20(b). He is fully aware of the impact delinquent \ndebt can have on his security clearance eligibility, but has not done sufficient work to \nresolve the issue. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable to his situation. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not presented \nsufficient evidence to show that he is resolving his debt situation in a responsible \nmanner. \nHe is not eligible for national security eligibility because continuation of \nfinancial irresponsibility is likely, and the potential for pressure or duress remains \nundiminished. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Tr. 80-82.) \nNotice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Iran. Applicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in HE-I. The facts are summarized in the written requests and will not be \nrepeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that the U.S. Government has \ndesignated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. It conducts cyber espionage and attacks \nand more traditional espionage against U.S. interests and allies. It has a dismal human \nrights record. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. \nApplicant has family members and associates who are citizens of Iran. Two of \nthem are Iranian residents, but most of the family members alleged have acquired \ncitizenship in the United States or are beginning the process towards U.S. citizenship or \nin the case of his uncle a resident and citizen of an allied nation, but Iran continues to \nrecognize them as Iranian citizens. This is true even when the new citizens took no \naffirmative steps to maintain their Iranian citizenship, and in the case of the United States, \nswore to renounce allegiance to Iran. Nonetheless, they remain Iranian citizens, and if \nthey choose to return to Iran for any reason, they will be treated as Iranian citizens. Iran \nis hostile to the United States. It is a state sponsor of terrorism; it conducts cyber \nespionage and attacks, and more traditional espionage against U.S. interests and allies; \nand it has a dismal human rights record. Applicant\u2019s contacts with Iranian citizens create \na potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the \nevidence. When foreign family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to \na foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. \n01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s academic work with two Iranian universities and writings with Iranian \nco-authors occurred more than ten years ago. He has had no further association with the \nuniversities or his co-authors. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j do not raise any disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially relevant: \n(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S; \n(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nFamily ties in a foreign country raise a prima facie security concern that required \nthe applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet \nthe burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for him. Thus, Applicant bears the burden to establish that \nhis relatives are not vulnerable to influence, coercion, exploitation, or duress. In this case, \nApplicant carefully explained that most of his family is in the U.S. His mother and father \nare in the process of becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He is their only child and thus \nhis children are his parents\u2019 only grandchildren. His mother-in-law and father-in-law are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen and an established medical \nprofessional. His children are native-born Americans. The only persons who remain in \nIran are an aunt and uncle with whom he has limited contact. Applicant does not discuss \nanything with his family members about his work or his job and he has no plans to ever \ndo so. None of his foreign family members in Iran are affiliated with a foreign government. \nHis work and writings with Iranian institutions and co-authors occurred during his \nacademic studies in Iran more than ten years ago. He has not had contact since with \neither the institutions or co-authors in over ten years. \nI find that it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of the United States and the interests of the Iranian government, a \nterrorist organization, or his Iranian family members. I further find there is no conflict of \ninterest, Applicant shown that his relationships and loyalties are in the United States, and \nthat he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly\nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. Iran is a leading \nstate sponsor of terrorism, conducts espionage against the United States, and has a \ndismal human rights record.  \n \nAlmost all of Applicant\u2019s family members are in the United States or Norway an \nallied country. Applicant is not close to the two family members remaining in Iran. \nApplicant was sincere, open, and candid at the hearing. His testimony reflected a mature, \nintelligent, hard-working engineer, who performs well at his job, and has the endorsement \nof his supervisor. It is also noted that while he was born in Iran, he is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen by choice. He is proud of his many accomplishments in the United States that he \nhas achieved on his own. With his wife (naturalized U.S. citizen) and children (U.S. \ncitizens by birth) as his closest family ties, along with both of his parents who have now \njoined their only child and begun the naturalization process, as well as his mother-in-law \nand father-in-law, who are naturalized U.S. citizens, Applicant has established that his \npermanent life is here in the United States. He has no intentions of ever returning to Iran. \nThere is nothing in Iran for him. I find that his relationships and loyalties are in the United \nStates, that Applicant would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, \nor duress in favor of the United States \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: Paragraph 1, \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence):   \nFOR APPLICANT \n8 \n\n \n \n                        \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j:   \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The case was assigned to me on May 3, 2023. \nThe hearing was scheduled for July 25, 2023, but it was rescheduled at \nApplicant\u2019s request.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since June 2022. He attended college for a period, but he has not \nearned a degree. He is twice divorced. His first marriage ended in 2010 and his second \nin 2020. He has two children, ages 24 and 18. (Tr. at 28-30, 34-35, 49-50; GE 1) \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor from 2014 until he was terminated in \nNovember 2019. His company provided him with a smart phone and a computer. He \nwas permitted to use both for personal reasons, but he was not permitted to use them \nfor inappropriate purposes, including viewing and downloading pornography. Applicant \nviewed pornography at his home on the work laptop from about October to November \n2019. He was terminated when it was discovered. (Tr. at 28-30, 52-55; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant is remorseful for the conduct. He stated that it was his way of dealing \nwith a stressful divorce. He asserted that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson, \nand the conduct will not be repeated. His current employer is unaware that he was \nterminated from a previous job for viewing pornography on his work computer. (Tr. at \n53-57, 61-62; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling about $48,670 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.c), a delinquent $212 utility bill (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and a child support account that was \n$2,781 past due with a $3,022 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant admitted owing the three \nlarge debts. He denied owing the utility debt. He admitted owing back child support, but \nhe stated that he was making payments. (Tr. at 39-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 2-6) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce and unemployment after \nhis termination. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered his efforts to find another job. He \nremained unemployed from about November 2019 to May 2021. (Tr. at 28-32, 34, 36-\n37; GE 1) \nApplicant did not discover he was the father of his younger child until she was \nabout 11 years old. When the court awarded child support, it awarded about $46,000 in \narrearages. Applicant paid about $26,000 toward the arrearages from his share of the \nequity in the family home, which was sold as part of the division of assets in his divorce. \nHis pay is being garnished for the child support and arrearages (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Now that \nhis daughter is 18, the garnishment will go completely to the arrearages. The balance \nhas been reduced from $3,053 on the January 2022 credit report, to $3,022 on the June \n2022 credit report, to $1,492 on the July 2023 credit report. (Tr. at 30-31, 44-48; GE 1-6 \nApplicant denied owing the $212 utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He stated that he never \nhad an account with that utility company. It is listed on all the credit reports in evidence. \n(Tr. at 44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-6) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not made any payments toward the three large debts. He planned\nto use the money from the sale of the marital home to pay his debts, but that money \nwent to his child support arrearages. He contacted the creditors in 2022 about settling \nthe debts, but his efforts were unsuccessful. His finances appear to be otherwise stable. \nWith his child support ending in the near future, he can use those funds toward paying \nhis delinquent debts. He has not received formal financial counseling. (Tr. at 31, 40, 49-\n52, 57-58; GE 2-6) \n \nApplicant called two witnesses who attested to his excellent job performance. \nThe witnesses praised his work ethic, judgment, reliability, responsibility, leadership, \nand trustworthiness. (Tr. at 12-27) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and child \nsupport arrearages. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce and unemployment after \nhe was terminated for viewing pornography on his work computer. His divorce qualifies \nas an event that was beyond his control. His unemployment was due to his own \nmisconduct and was not beyond his control. \nI am giving Applicant the benefit of the doubt about the small utility debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d). His child support arrearages (SOR \u00b6 1.e) are almost paid. Those allegations are \nmitigated. See ISCR Case No. 20-03457 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2023). \nApplicant has not paid any of the three remaining debts alleged in the SOR. He \ndoes not have a track record that would enable me to trust that he will pay those debts. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that his financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmanipulate, protect, or move information.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nApplicant violated company policy when he viewed pornography on his work \nlaptop. AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(e) and 40(f) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology systems security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good\u00adfaith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nThere are no bright-line rules to establish when conduct is recent. It has been \nalmost four years since Applicant used his company laptop to view pornography. He is \nremorseful for the conduct. He stated that it was his way of dealing with a stressful \ndivorce. He asserted that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson, and the conduct \nwill not be repeated. However, he knew what he did was wrong, he chose to do it \nanyway, and it cost him his job.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations and use of information technology security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and State A income tax returns, as required, \nfor tax years 2014 through 2016. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant had been delinquent in filing his tax returns due to being depressed over \nthe end of his second marriage when his wife took his young child out of the country. He \nalso had a good-faith, but mistaken, belief that if he did not owe taxes he did not have to \nfile a tax return. He filed the subject tax returns in February 2022, before issuance of the \nSOR. Unfortunately, he forgot to sign the returns and they had to be refiled in October \n2022. The returns are now with the IRS and, as filed, he does not owe any taxes.

Guideline F is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided sufficient \nevidence to show that he has resolved his tax issues, and that they will not recur in the \nfuture. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has been resolved. Overall, the \nevidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance.

On November 21, 2022, Department \nCounsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing three \nItems. Applicant received the FORM on December 19, 2022. He was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM, \nobject to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. Hence, all Items are admitted \ninto evidence. The case was assigned to me on February 9, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all allegations contained in both paragraphs of the SOR. (Item \n1) His admissions are incorporated into these findings. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He has worked \nas a digital design engineer for a defense contractor since August 2017. (Item 1) \nApplicant has a history of using marijuana, beginning in March 2011 when he was \nin college and continuing, with varying frequency, into September 2021 when he \nsubmitted his SCA for a position with a defense contractor. He stated that he used \nmarijuana \u201cmost days in a week during the evenings.\u201d (Item 2 at 28) He said he used it \nfor arthritis because it helps alleviate his pain and relieves nausea, which he experiences \nfrom cancer medications. (Id.) \nApplicant also disclosed in his SCA that in February 2017, he was previously \ninvestigated for a \u201cTS-SCI clearance without success.\u201d (Item 2 at 31) At that time he was \nemployed by a defense contractor, who terminated him for his admitted use of marijuana \nand inability to obtain a security clearance because of it. (Item 1) He stated that he used \nmarijuana from December 2011 to February 2012, while working as an intern for defense \ncontractor A and holding a security clearance. (Item 1) \nDuring a December 2021 interview with a government investigator, Applicant \nstated that after he was denied a security clearance in February 2017, and he was \nterminated from his position with defense contractor B. He then stopped using marijuana \nbecause he wanted to apply for a job with defense contractor C, and he knew he may \nneed to pass a drug test required for employment. In June or July 2017, he passed a drug \nscreening and began working for defense contractor C in August 2017. He subsequently \nresumed using marijuana in spring of 2018. He uses marijuana in the evenings during the \nweek and on weekends. He primarily uses it for medicinal purposes but acknowledged \nthere is a social element in using it. He said he was unfamiliar with any employment \nrequirements to report his marijuana use. (Item 3) \nApplicant denied that any physician prescribed marijuana for him. He indicated that \nmarijuana is legal in his home state. He obtains it at a local dispensary. He told the \ninvestigator that he would rather work on unclassified projects, than stop using marijuana. \nHe said his family and friends are aware of his marijuana use.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the concerns related to drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nRecently, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications. It states in \npertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by an \nindividual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual's life to \ndetermine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if at \nall, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions.1 \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has illegally used and possessed marijuana with varying frequency from \nMarch 2011 up to August 2021, as alleged. He used it from December 2011 to February \n2012 after being granted access to classified or sensitive information while working for a \ndefense contractor. He admitted in his 2022 Answer that he intends to continue using it. \nThe evidence established the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. Three may potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n1  Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting \nAdjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021 (SecEA Clarifying Guidance), at page 2. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant did not present evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nconditions. His use of marijuana is ongoing. He has illegally used and possessed \nmarijuana from 2011 when he was in college, up to 2022, when he submitted his Answer \nto the SOR. He has used it with varying frequency. He asserted that he has used it as a \nmedicinal aid to alleviate the pain he has suffered for many years from several medical \nconditions. He has not participated in a substance abuse treatment program, and there \nis no evidence to suggest that he intends to do that or stop using marijuana. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nBetween December 2011 and February 2012, Applicant possessed and used \nmarijuana while working for defense contractor A and having been granted access to \nclassified or sensitive information. In February 2017, Applicant was terminated from a \nposition with defense contractor B because he admitted that he used and possessed \nmarijuana in violation of the employer\u2019s work policies. He then stopped using marijuana \nin order to pursue a position with defense contractor C, and he knew he would likely be \nrequired to pass a drug screening test.

The evidence establishes the above disqualifying condition and demonstrates \nquestionable judgement as articulated in AG \u00b6 15. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides a condition that could potentially mitigate security concerns \nraised under this guideline: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant used and possessed marijuana while working as an intern for defense \ncontractor A between 2011 and 2012, during which time he had been granted access to \nclassified or sensitive information. He continued to use it until he was terminated by \ndefense contractor B in February 2017 after acknowledging he used it. Applicant then \nstopped using it until spring of 2018. During that interim, he passed a drug screening test \nand obtained his current position with defense contractor C. He subsequently resumed \nusing marijuana on a regular basis. Applicant\u2019s intentional acts to bypass federal \nregulations was a serious breach of trust and casts serious doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability \nand good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in this whole-person analysis. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n                         \n \n \n \n      \n         \n \n \n     \n                   \n \n \n     \n                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of using marijuana beginning in 2011 when he was in \ncollege and continuing into the present. He stopped using it in 2017 when he lost a \ndefense position. For a couple months between 2017 and 2018, he stopped using it to \navoid a positive drug screening because he had applied for another federal position. After \nhe obtained a position, he resumed using it and continues to use it on a daily basis. He \nis candid about his usage, and he asserts that marijuana brings him pain relief for his \nmedical issues. While his usage may have some medical benefit for him, it does not \nprovide a waiver of federal law regarding the use and possession of marijuana for federal \ncontractors. The law is clear. It is prohibited and he is precluded from working for a \ndefense contractor and holding a security clearance, regardless of whether marijuana is \nlegal in his state. He is a mature person and is subject to the consequences of his \ndecisions. Applicant failed to demonstrate rehabilitation, significant behavioral changes, \nor mitigate the security concerns raised. Overall, the evidence raises serious doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \n  Subparagraph 2.a: \n Conclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. He married in November 2022 and has no children. He \ngraduated from high school in 2011. He attended college full time from 2011 to 2016. He \nattended college part-time from January 2017 to June 2017 and from August 2018 to \nNovember 2019. He did not earned a degree. He intends to continue to pursue a degree. \nHe has worked for a federal contractor since October 2020. (Item 3) \nAfter leaving college in 2016, Applicant had a series of jobs, some part-time and \nsometimes he was self-employed as a rideshare driver. From July 2017 to June 2018, he \nworked full-time as a member of AmeriCorps and moved to another state (State A). He \nworked with inner city and at-risk youth. He was not classified as an employee under this \nprogram and was paid a stipend, which barely covered his expenses in a high cost-of-\nliving state. He did not have a car, and his commute was an hour to and from the school \nby bus. Although he found this experience very rewarding, his days were often 13 hours \nlong with his commute. After he completed his obligation, he returned to his home state \n(State B) and worked as a rideshare driver. (AE A) \nIn the past, Applicant\u2019s father filed his federal and state income tax returns for him. \nHe was aware that because he lived in State A and State B for parts of 2017 and 2018, \nhe would have to file state income tax returns for both states. He believed his father had \nfiled his tax returns, but later learned that his father had only filed extensions. He resumed \ncollege, continued working as a driver, and worked for a company that hosted afterschool \nprograms for elementary school children that centered around science, technology, \nengineering, and math. He was considered an independent contractor. In February 2019, \nhe started a new job with a restaurant and his father told him he would file an extension \nfor him for his 2018 tax returns. This is when he learned that his 2017 returns were not \nyet filed, and he needed to complete them. Applicant admitted he was overwhelmed with \nschool and work. At the same time, his girlfriend, with whom he was living, was diagnosed \nwith Type 1 diabetes. He admitted he procrastinated in filing his tax returns.

He was expecting them to be complex because of his multiple moves and non-\ntraditional income from AmeriCorps, as a rideshare driver, and as an independent \ncontractor. Because of his limited income, he did not expect to owe taxes. His parents \noften filed their tax returns late, and he believed it was permitted to file late if you did not \nowe taxes. He now understands that is not correct. (AE A) \nApplicant suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which he is able to \ncontrol. It rarely affects his regular day-to-day activities, but he often feels compelled to \nmake sure everything he does is perfect. It sometimes causes him to delay acting on \ncertain things until he can ensure every detail is correct. He admits that he was reluctant \nto immediately address his tax issues because once he started them they would consume \nhim. (AE A) \nIn 2020, Applicant and his girlfriend moved to State C. Because he had only lived \nin one state the previous year, his tax returns were not complicated and he filed his 2019 \nfederal and state tax returns. It was the first year he filed his tax returns by himself. He \nadmitted he did not budget enough time to complete them and his federal tax return was \nfiled on July 22, 2020. Due to the pandemic, the deadline for filing 2019 tax returns was \nextended to July 15, 2020. He was seven days late. His adjusted gross income was \n$24,475. He was entitled to a refund. (AE A, D). \nIn January 2021, Applicant\u2019s apartment was burglarized. His backpack was stolen. \nIn it was his mileage log he kept when he was a rideshare driver in 2018. He was not sure \nhow to proceed to complete his delinquent tax returns because he did not have this \nneeded information. \nIn April 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) and in it \ndisclosed his failure to timely file his federal and state tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He \nexplained in the SCA that he believed for 2017 that he would not owe taxes and they \nwould be complicated to complete. He filed his 2017 federal and state income tax returns \nin April 2021. (AE B) \nApplicant also disclosed in his SCA that he failed to file his 2018 federal and state \nincome tax returns. He explained that he did not think he owed taxes. During this tax year \nhe was a driver and when his mileage log was stolen, it complicated how to estimate his \nexpenses. He readily admitted that he should not have delayed filing his tax returns. His \n2018 federal and state tax returns were filed in October 2021. His adjusted gross income \nwas $5,741. With penalties and interest, he owed $301, which he paid. (AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. Tax year 2017 was filed in April 2021, tax year 2018 was \nfiled in October 2021, and tax year 2019 was filed a week late in July 2020. (AE B, C, D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged Applicant failed to timely file State A income tax returns for tax \nyears 2017 and 2018. Applicant filed his 2017 State A tax return in April 2021.

He filed his 2018 State A tax return in \nOctober 2021. He did not owe taxes. (AE A, H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged Applicant failed to timely file State B income tax returns for \n2017, 2018, and 2019. He filed his 2017 State B income tax returns in May 2021 and his \n2018 returns in October 2021. Applicant filed his 2019 State B returns on July 22, 2020. \nHe stated in his FORM response that State B allows for an automatic six-month extension \nfor filing if no taxes are owed. State B\u2019s filing deadline was June 1, 2020. Because \nApplicant did not owe state taxes, he was within the six-month extension period. (AE A; \nAE G page 1, 6, 9-11) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged Applicant failed to timely file State C income tax return for tax \nyear 2018. Applicant erroneously disclosed on his SCA that he lived in State C in 2018. \nHe actually lived there in 2020, so he was not required to file in State C for 2018. Applicant \nfiled his 2020 State C income tax returns 14 days late. He owed $48 and paid the tax. \n(AE I) \nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2020 in May 2021. He was \nentitled to a refund. He filed his 2021 tax year federal income tax return on time in April \n2022. His state tax returns for these years were filed timely. \nApplicant takes responsibility for failing to timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns. He primarily attributed his failures to being inexperienced; overwhelmed that \nfiling tax returns would be complicated because he lived in multiple states; believing for a \nperiod that his father had filed for him; his belief that if you did not owe taxes you did not \nhave to file on time; and his procrastination. Applicant recognizes that he failed to make \nfiling his tax returns a priority, but that has changed. (AE A) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he said all of his delinquent tax returns are \nfiled and provided supporting documents. He paid whatever taxes were owed and any \npenalties and interest imposed. He now uses a software program to help him prepare his \ntax returns and plans to continue to use it in the future. He has created reminders on his \ncalendar to notify him when tax deadlines are approaching. He keeps a tax folder on his \ncomputer with copies of his previous tax returns. He has opted to receive all of his tax \ndocuments electronically and stores them by year on his computer. If he receives a tax \ndocument that is not delivered electronically, he scans it and saves it to the folder on his \ncomputer. He no longer works as an independent contractor so his tax returns are simpler. \n(AE A) \nI have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR \nfor disqualifying purposes.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as required.  \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, \nand 2019. He failed to timely file State A and State B income tax returns for tax years \n2017 and 2018. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying condition. \nIt was alleged Applicant failed to timely file State C income tax returns for tax year \n2018, but he did not live in State C in 2018. It also was alleged that he failed to timely file \nhis State B tax return for tax year 2019. I find in his favor for this allegation. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax returns are filed and he paid any taxes he owed. \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns. I believe \nfuture tax issues are unlikely to recur because Applicant has a new appreciation for the \nseriousness of ensuring he timely files and pays his taxes, he has a system in place that \nwill help him meet the appropriate deadlines, and he has matured and now understands \nthat filing tax returns on time is a serious responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nSome of the delay in filing can be attributed to Applicant\u2019s inexperience and \nintimidation of the potential complexity for filing the returns. Some of the delay can be \nattributed to him incorrectly believing that he did not have to timely file tax returns if he \ndid not owe taxes, which could be the case if he was under a certain income level, but \nnot if he was self-employed as a rideshare driver. I attributed these reasons to him being \nyoung and immature. These reasons were marginally beyond his control. However, his \ncontinued delay in addressing his delinquent tax filings was due to his failure to make it a \npriority, and to his procrastination, both of which were within his control. The question is \ndid he act responsibly under the circumstances. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s continued procrastination and failure to get his tax returns filed for \nan extended period of time. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has received financial counseling, but there is \nevidence that he has resolved his tax issues and that future problems are unlikely to recur. \nI find AG \u00b6 20(c) has some application. I also find AG \u00b6 20(g) applies as all of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent federal and state tax returns are filed. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Some of the factors in AG \n\u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI have considered whether Applicant was intentionally attempting to avoid filing his \ntax returns and whether he is likely to do so in the future. I note that he relied on his father \nin the past to take care of his tax returns, and he did not have an appreciation for the \nseriousness of making sure it is done timely. Clearly, his father did not set a good \nexample. When Applicant was in State A, receiving a stipend, and had minimum income \nhe did not understand his tax obligations. Moving to another state only exacerbated his \nparalysis in tackling his tax issues, so he again procrastinated, which made his situation \nworse. Applicant now understands his legal obligations and responsibility and will comply \nwith the rules and regulations that govern filing tax returns. \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nno questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns \nraised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate alcohol consumption and criminal conduct concerns.

Further factual findings will be developed from the evidence presented in \nthe record. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old civilian employee of a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant \nand material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant never married and has no children. (GE 1; Tr. 23, 52) He earned a high \nschool diploma in May 2006 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in February 2013. He reported no \nmilitary service (GE 1) \nSince June 2019, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as an \nassembler. (GE 1) Between December 2013 and June 2019, he worked for other non-\nDoD employers in various jobs. (GE 1) He reported brief periods of unemployment \nbetween October 2011 and December 2013. Applicant has never held a security \nclearance. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol background history \nApplicant\u2019s medical records reveal that he was introduced to alcohol at the age of \nseventeen. (GEs 1-6) Between August 2009 and August 2021, he consumed alcohol at \ntimes to excess and to the point of intoxication. (GEs 1-6) His drinking patterns during \nthis period consisted of daily drinking (generally three beers a day), and multiple beers \non the weekends (ranging between 18 and 30 beers). His drinking included assorted \nhard liquors as well. (GEs 2-3 and 6) \nBetween August 2009 and August 2012, Applicant was twice arrested for \nalcohol-related incidents. (GE 4; Tr. 24) Records document his arrest and charge in \nAugust 2014 for assault on a family/household member (his sister). (GE 5; Tr. 26-27) \nApplicant pled guilty to the assault incident and was fined $700 and told by the court \u201cto \nstay out of trouble.\u201d (GEs 2 and 6) The reported assault incident was non-alcohol \nrelated. \nFaced with episodic depression and anxiety, Applicant self-referred himself to L \nHealth System in August 2017 for counseling and treatment of a condition diagnosed as \nalcohol use disorder (moderate to severe). (GE 3; Tr. 33-34, and 40) During his 30-day \ninpatient stay, his treatment counselors addressed his diagnosed depression and \nalcohol issues with medications designed to mitigate his problems with these issues. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n(GE 3) His inpatient treatment protocol included AA attendance (with some meetings \nreported by Applicant during his 30-day inpatient stay). (Tr. 36) \nApplicant\u2019s L Health System discharge summary credited him with medical \nimprovement in all of the areas addressed and confirmed a fair to good prognosis with \nrecommended follow-up with his primary care health provider. (GE 3) For the ensuing \ntwo years following his discharge, Applicant retained his sobriety with the support of his \nfamily and stayed in compliance with the recommendations of his treatment providers. \n(GE 2; Tr. 36-37) \nFollowing his L Health System discharge in September 2019, Applicant resumed \nhis drinking during a family vacation. (GE 6; Tr. 36-37) Medical records document his\nreturn to drinking at daily levels in 2019. (GEs 2 and 6) In July 2021, he self-referred\nhimself for inpatient treatment at a local medical center\u2019s (O Center) chemical\ndependency unit. (GE 2) His admission diagnosis was listed as alcohol abuse severe on\nthe Axis 1 scale. See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, American\nPsychiatric Association (5th  ed., 2013) (DSM -5). His 30-day inpatient treatment protocol\nincluded individual and group therapy sessions and AA meetings. (Tr. 41-42)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was discharged from O Center\u2019s outpatient facility in August 2021 with \na discharge diagnosis of alcohol dependency, depression by history, and nicotine \ndependency, all on the Axis I scale, and a listed prognosis of \u201cGuarded.\u201d (GE 2) \nDischarge instructions for Applicant consisted of the following: Attend 90 AA/NA \nmeetings in 90 days, with five meetings per week thereafter, attend aftercare sessions \nweekly for a minimum of one year, and obtain and utilize a sponsor. (GE 2; Tr. 55) \nOnce discharged from O Center, Applicant declined to pursue most of the \nrecommended AA and aftercare participation (attending only a few AA meetings before \nsuspending his AA participation). Citing his earned receipt of an AA chip \ncommemorating his one-year of sobriety and his own assurances of his sustaining his \nsobriety for the previous two years, Applicant assured that his sobriety program was \nworking for him. (GE 6) \nAsked in his personal subject interview (PSI) by the interviewing investigator from \nthe Office of Personnel Management about his post-O Center follow-up with\nrecommended AA participation, Applicant replied that AA did not work out for him. (GE\n6) He told the investigator that he has been able to control his urges to resume drinking\nwith the support of his family, aided by lessons learned from his past experiences, and\nis no longer a risk to return to drinking. (GE 6) When he needs additional support to\nmaintain his abstinence, he has his sister to turn to. (Tr. 54) \n \n \n \n \n \nTo his credit, Applicant contemporaneously self-reported his alcohol relapses to \nhis supervisors with whom he has good working relationships. (Tr. 38-39) For his \ncontinuing efforts in achieving sustained sobriety, Applicant is entitled to considerable \ncredit and encouragement.

Additional \nsecurity concerns are raised over a single non-alcohol arrest and charge in 2014 for \nassault with a family member (his sister). \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn the strength of the evidence documented in the record, five disqualifying \nconditions (DCs) of the alcohol consumption guideline apply. DCs \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the \nfrequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder\u201d; 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point \nof impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nabuse disorder\u201d; 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder\u201d; 22(e), \u201cthe failure to follow treatment advice once \ndiagnosed\u201d; and 22(f), \u201calcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder,\u201d   are all applicable to the \nfacts of record in Applicant\u2019s case.  \nBy recognizing his mistakes in judgment associated with his recurrent periods of \nabusive drinking (even after receiving counseling and treatment for abusing alcohol), \nApplicant\u2019s abusive drinking is extenuated in considerable part by his encountered \ndifficulties in maintaining his sobriety for more than two years at a time, attributable to \nonsets of episodic depression and anxiety issues. Based on the evidence presented, \nApplicant may take partial advantage of two mitigating conditions (MCs). MCs \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment\u201d; and 23(b), \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation in this case. \nCross-alleged under Guideline E are Applicant\u2019s DwI and DuI incidents of 2009 \nand 2012, respectively. Both of these incidents occurred over 10 years ago and at a \ntime when Applicant was abusing alcohol on a daily basis. These alcohol-related \nincidents are fully covered by Guideline G and do not share any independent \nsignificance under Guideline E. Because of the addition of Applicant\u2019s non-alcohol-\nrelated arrest and charge of assault on his sister, Applicant\u2019s two DuI incidents and non-\nalcohol-related incident can be considered together as a pattern of minor expenses that \nretains independent significance in need of separate addressing under Guideline J. \nApplicable to this August 2014 arrest is DC \u00b6  31(a), \u201ca pattern of minor offenses, any \none of which on its own would be unlikely to effect a national security eligibility decision, \nbut which in combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nBased on the composite of corrective actions he has taken since he last \nconsumed alcohol in 2021, Applicant can be credited with making considerable \nprogress in the management of his mental health and alcohol intake since his discharge \nfrom O Center in September 2021. However, validation of his maintaining his sobriety \nover the past two years cannot be accepted on the basis of his assurances alone. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBefore he can be fully cleared of relapse risks, both letters of support and an updated \ndiagnosis and prognosis are needed to clear away any doubts about his recurrence \nrisks. Offered an opportunity to provide medical updates and endorsements from \ntherapists, supervisors, coworkers, family, and friends who are familiar with his past \nalcohol issues and his progress in avoiding alcohol over the past two years, Applicant \nfurnished strong post-hearing endorsements of his character and trustworthiness. None \nof his references could attest to his past problems with alcohol abuse and what steps he \nis currently taking to maintain his sobriety and satisfy the post-discharge \nrecommendations of his O Center treating professionals. \nEpisodic periods of depression and anxiety that affected Applicant and influence \nhis recurrent turn to drinking are clearly extenuating and mitigating. However, the \ncircumstances that prompted him to return to abusive drinking to self-medicate his \nemotional issues are not enough to relieve him of his responsibilities of satisfying the \npost-discharge recommendations of his O Center treating professionals. Without an \nupdated diagnosis and prognosis from an aftercare therapy group, Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence assurances cannot be solely relied upon at this time that Applicant can (a) \nmaintain his established abstinence regimen and (b) is at no material risk to return to \nalcohol abuse in the foreseeable future. \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s two DwI and DuI offenses and non-alcohol-related \nassault offense involve considered minor offenses that taken together reflect mistakes \nof judgment that have not recurred since the last reported incident of August 2014. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s alcohol issues retain continuing security concerns, he has leaned \nenough from his past mistakes of judgment to present little risk of recurrent criminal \narrests. Applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation is MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed \nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of recurrent alcohol abuse is incompatible with his \nholding a security clearance. Since his discharge from counseling and treatment from O \nCenter in 2021, he has made considerable progress in managing his alcohol-related \nissues and shows good promise in sustaining his abstinence in the future. He deserves \nconsiderable credit as well for his contributions to the defense industry. Updates are \nneeded (both personal and professional) to verify and corroborate his progress Based \non the evidence presented, it is still too soon to absolve him of risks of recurrence \nbased on the developed record. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Their CPA was \ndiagnosed with cancer and they had difficulty trying to retrieve their tax papers from her. \nAt his hearing, he repeated his statement made in response to DOHA interrogatories that \nhis wife also attempted to hire two tax service companies to correct their tax issues, but \nthey were unable to provide assistance.

The tax preparer informed \nher that he would have to file a paper tax return for 2020, and that it could cause some \ndelays.

He disclosed in his \nNovember 2021 interrogatory that he had arranged a payment plan with the state tax \ndepartment, and he was making monthly payments of $240. He submitted documentation \ndated December 2022 from the state department of revenue that showed he had made \n12 payments of $240 and the current balance of his outstanding state tax was $12,530. \nIt is unclear if this amount was for a specific tax year, or whether it was a combined total \nof all of his delinquent state taxes.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2017, 2018, \n2019, and 2020. His delinquent Federal income taxes for tax years 2017 through 2020 \ntotal approximately $50,000, and his outstanding taxes owed to the state are \napproximately $13,000. These debts have been delinquent for several years, and they \nremain delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n . . . suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-\nestablished governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nsuch rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. \nISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted \nin the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same \ntoken, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax returns. \nRather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and \nreliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria \n& Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. \nCir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has commented that an Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nincome tax returns (or, as alleged here, to address resulting tax debt): \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. His failure \nto timely file his Federal and state income tax returns persisted for four consecutive years. \nAfter his discovery in 2018 that their 2017 tax returns had not been filed due to the CPA\u2019s \nillness, he should have taken immediate steps to remedy the situation. Instead, three \nmore years followed with his Federal and state tax returns not being filed on time. It \nappears that only after he applied for a DOD security clearance that he finally decided to \ntake action to resolve his tax issues. \nApplicant\u2019s excuse that his wife\u2019s identity was stolen and caused them to file their \n2020 Federal income tax return late is not supported by evidence in the record. The email \ncommunication dated February 2022, from their tax preparer stated that he (tax preparer) \nhad just been notified by the IRS that the electronic filing of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s 2020 tax \nreturn was rejected due to a 2020 tax return already filed under her social security \nnumber. At this point in time, Applicant and his wife were unaware of the fraud, but it is \nclear from this communication that their 2020 income tax return had been filed late \nnonetheless. In fact, the identity theft had nothing to do with the untimely filing of their \n2020 Federal tax return. \nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he established a payment plan with the state tax department, \nand has made 12 payments to reduce his delinquent state tax debt. The problem, \nhowever, is that his state tax debt has continued to increase, not decrease, since the \nSOR was issued. The amount originally alleged in the SOR was $8,965, and it has now \ngrown to approximately $12,530. It is important to note that his Federal tax debt, originally \nalleged in the SOR as $15,406, is now approximately $50,000. Applicant did not provide \nany evidence that he has arranged a payment plan, or that he has made any payments \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non this significant Federal tax debt. These tax delinquencies have persisted for several \nyears and are still unresolved. \nApplicant did not demonstrate that his tax delinquencies arose from conditions \nbeyond his control and that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve \nthese issues. There is no evidence of any debt-resolution efforts with the Federal \ngovernment, and despite making 12 payments towards his delinquent state tax debt, the \nbalance of this debt has continued to grow. None of the financial considerations mitigation \nconditions apply. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s untimely filing of his Federal and state income taxes continued for four \nconsecutive years. As such, he developed significant outstanding tax debt to both the \nstate and Federal government. He has made payments towards his state tax debt, but \ndespite these payments, his state tax debt has continued to increase over time. He has \nnot provided sufficient documentation that he is arranging a payment plan, or made any \npayments to the Federal government for approximately $50,000 of delinquent tax debt \nbeyond filing his tax returns and having some funds withheld from his salary. Given his \nburden to demonstrate reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.d.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 42 years old and has two sons ages 19 and 20, who live with her. She and her cohabitant have lived together since January 2008. She married her first husband in June 1998; they divorced in November 2000. She married her second husband in August 2005; they divorced in May 2009. Since February 2016, she has worked full-time for a defense contractor. (GE 3; Tr. 17.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant is past due for $7,837 on a loan whose total balance is $39,687. The SOR also alleged that she is past due for $21,549 on a mortgage whose total balance is $191,579. (SOR \u00b6 1.) She admitted both allegations, with explanations during her testimony. From June 2007 until December 2020, she and her family lived in the home that is the subject of the two SOR allegations (the Townhouse). (Answer; Tr. 23; GE 1.) Direct Testimony. Applicant testified that she bought the Townhouse in 2007. In 2008 the market crashed. Almost immediately her home mortgage was underwater. As the mortgage remained underwater for years during the financial crisis, COVID struck. She contacted the mortgage company to try a short sale. It denied that, saying she could use COVID relief. But she could not afford to sell the Townhouse without a short sale. She also asked about a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The mortgage company said it was not doing those because of the President\u2019s mandate against foreclosures during COVID. (Tr. 15.) Applicant testified that the Townhouse wa",

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 5, 2022. The \ncase was assigned to me on November 17, 2022. On January 9, 2023, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be \nconducted in person on February 2, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \nGovernment submitted Exhibits marked (GE) 1 through 11, which were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted two exhibits, which were \nmarked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, and admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on February 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 42 years old and has two sons ages 19 and 20, who live with her. She \nand her cohabitant have lived together since January 2008. She married her first husband \nin June 1998; they divorced in November 2000. She married her second husband in \nAugust 2005; they divorced in May 2009. Since February 2016, she has worked full-time \nfor a defense contractor. (GE 3; Tr. 17.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant is past due for $7,837 on a loan \nwhose total balance is $39,687. The SOR also alleged that she is past due for $21,549 \non a mortgage whose total balance is $191,579. (SOR \u00b6 1.) She admitted both \nallegations, with explanations during her testimony. From June 2007 until December \n2020, she and her family lived in the home that is the subject of the two SOR allegations \n(the Townhouse). (Answer; Tr. 23; GE 1.) \nDirect Testimony. Applicant testified that she bought the Townhouse in 2007. In \n2008 the market crashed. Almost immediately her home mortgage was underwater. As \nthe mortgage remained underwater for years during the financial crisis, COVID struck. \nShe contacted the mortgage company to try a short sale. It denied that, saying she could \nuse COVID relief. But she could not afford to sell the Townhouse without a short sale. \nShe also asked about a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The mortgage company said it was \nnot doing those because of the President\u2019s mandate against foreclosures during COVID. \n(Tr. 15.) \nApplicant testified that the Townhouse was never refinanced, but the mortgage \nloan might have been sold a few times. It was an 80/20 loan. That was what mortgage \ncompanies were doing in 2007. It was an interest-only loan. She was trying to get out of \nthe loan, because she was having problems with rodents getting into the Townhouse. \nShe could not stop them, because her home was connected to everyone else in that row. \nShe could only clean up and close holes in her home. She also found a copperhead snake \nin her basement. (Tr. 15-16.) \nAt this point, Applicant offered two exhibits. The first, marked AEA, was identified \nas a Judgment of Absolute Divorce dated May 6, 2009, captioned XYZ v. Applicant, in \nthe Circuit Court for State A. (XYZ was her second husband. GE 1.) AEA involves the \ndisposition of her and her second husband\u2019s home (the Marital Home).

(Tr. 16-17.) \nCross-Examination. Applicant works for a contracting company doing Information \nTechnology. She has worked there for seven years. Her annual gross pay is about \n$85,000. She has worked full-time for a federal contractor since 2001. She has had a \nSecret security clearance since 2011, and her current employer is her security clearance \nsponsor. (Tr. 18-20.) \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant works in construction and makes about $45,000 per year. \nHe is the father of both her sons. She, her sons, and her cohabitant live in State A (the \nResidence). She is on the deed for the Residence, but not on the loan. She is not on the \nloan, because she did not want to be on the loan. She helps with household bills but not \nwith the mortgage. She is asked about a $711 per month rental charge on GE 5. That \nrent is for her son\u2019s apartment when he is at college. Neither of her sons pay rent to her \ncohabitant, nor do they help with the mortgage. Only one of her sons is in college; the \nother son works. (Tr. 20-22.) \nApplicant was questioned about the SOR. When she bought the Townhouse in \n2007, she did not intend it to be a rental property. The purchase price was $225,000. After \nthe purchase, she and her family moved in. Asked about its market value now, she was \nunsure, \u201clike $200,000, maybe.\u201d She was asked whether online estimates of $224,000 \nand $253,000 seemed \u201cabout right.\u201d She answered \u201cno;\u201d they were \u201ctoo high.\u201d She based \nher $200,000 on \u201cother ones that have sold recently in the area.\u201d (Tr. 22-24.) \nApplicant was referred to GE 2, page 7, account 11. (GE 2 is a credit report of  \n2/24/2022.) The \u201copening date\u201d is when she bought the Townhouse in June 2007.  But \nthe $180,000 high credit is not the only loan; she bought the Townhouse for $225,000. \nThere were two loans \u201ctechnically.\u201d The other loan was for $45,000, for a total of \n$225,000, the sale price. She did not use her own money for a down payment. She \nconfirmed that she never refinanced her Townhouse mortgages, saying: \u201cHow can you \nrefinance a loan that\u2019s under water?\u201d Applicant was asked if the \u201cbank has changed \npayments?\u201d She replied that: \u201c[They] sell loans. I didn\u2019t do it. It was \u2013 the banks.\u201d (Tr. 25-\n27.)   \nApplicant was referred to GE 4, page 5, top two entries. (GE 4 is a credit report of \n8/2/2011.) She was asked how the $180,000 loan balance was reduced by only $22 in \nfour years. She explained that it was an interest-only loan. She testified that was what \nmortgage companies were doing in 2007. That was the only way she could get a loan \nand \u201cout of the of the house to get away from my ex-husband with my children.\u201d She \nexplained that the $45,000 loan balance was reduced by only $222, because it too was \nan interest-only loan. (Tr. 27- 31.) \nApplicant was asked why she stopped paying her two Townhouse mortgages in \nApril or May 2020. She stopped paying to qualify for a short sale. The mortgage company \nsaid since she was paying on time, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t work with me.\u201d They did not approve \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher short sale. She has not paid on the Townhouse mortgages, since the spring of 2020. \nShe moved out in December 2020. The mortgage companies are in the process of \nforeclosure. (Tr. 31-32.) \nApplicant was asked if she hired an exterminator about the snake. She did not but \nsaid: \u201cWe went around the house. We closed up all the holes like you\u2019re supposed to. \nYou know, you put vents on the thing. We did everything we could do.\u201d A neighbor came \nin and killed the snake. She never saw another snake, but she did not stay long after the \nphoto of the snake (AEB) was taken in June 2020. Her Townhouse was a middle unit, \nwith units on the left and right. She tried her best to close up holes or gaps between her \nTownhouse and her neighbors. But \u201cstuff was still getting in.\u201d The Townhouse complex \nis in the country surrounded by woods. (Tr. 23-24, 33-34. \nAfter moving out in the summer of 2020, Applicant has never tried to rent or sell \nthe Townhouse. She has keys to the Townhouse but believes the bank has changed the \nlocks. She was referred to GE 11, page 7, account 13. (GE 11 is a credit report of \n1/23/2023.) She \u201chad no clue\u201d her mortgage account had been transferred until she saw \nGE 11. She received nothing in the mail from the new mortgagee shown on GE 11. Every \nonce in a while she receives statements from the lender shown in SOR \u00b6 1.b. but no \nphone calls. She submitted paperwork for her short sale request, but that lender denied \nit. (Tr. 34-37.) \nApplicant\u2019s short sale was denied, because the bank kept saying she could use \nCOVID relief. She no longer felt safe in the house, and her family had outgrown the \nTownhouse. She tried to hold on to it as long as she could. She understood that the \nCOVID program could be a pause on the payments or lower the mortgage payments but \nwould not get her out of her underwater loan. (Tr. 37-38.) \nApplicant has nothing in writing from a real estate broker as to what her Townhouse \ncould sell for. She has not spoken with one since she left in December 2020, because \nshe was trying to work with the banks. Her opinion that the Townhouse is worth about \n$200,000 is based on comparable sales in the area. When she left the Townhouse, \u201cthey \nwere going for a lot less.\u201d Her plan is to keep working with the mortgage company, but it \nhas \u201csold it [the mortgage] again, so she will need \u201cto track down the latest number [for \nthe latest mortgage holder].\u201d (Tr. 38-39.) \nApplicant was referred to GE 10, page 2, second paragraph. (GE 10 is the \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) of 9/2/2021.) She was asked if it was still her plan to let \nthe Townhouse go into foreclosure, if she cannot work out a sale? She answered: \u201cThe \nloan is underwater. I mean I\u2019m trying to work with the mortgage company. I can\u2019t afford to \npay the difference of what I owe and what the house would sell for.\u201d In the PSI, she said \nshe could not \u201cmaintain two mortgages.\u201d She clarified that it is \u201cnot really a mortgage.\u201d \nShe is paying household bills at her current Residence. (Tr. 39-40.) \nWhen Applicant lived in the Townhouse, she did not pay homeowner\u2019s association \nfees. She was responsible for outside upkeep. After she left, she and a neighbor mowed \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe yard; it was very little.

The entry shows a joint mortgage. \nShe confirmed that the mortgage is on her parents\u2019 house. She is on that mortgage. Her \nfather lost his job. So, she signed on to the loan, so her parents would not lose their \nhouse. It was not a refinancing.  They bought the house in about 2005. She pays nothing \non their house. She has never helped them pay the mortgage. She believes she is on the \ndeed. If her parents sold the house, she would not receive any of the proceeds. (Tr. 41-\n42.) \nApplicant was referred to GE 6. (GE 6 is a Notice of Default of 10/20/2009.) She \nconfirmed that this is about a foreclosure on the Marital Home she owned with her second \nhusband. She was referred to GE 4, page 4, the last entry. (GE 4 is a credit report of \n8/2/2011.) She believes that transaction was a transfer, not a refinance. She was not \ninvolved in that transfer; it was all handled by her second husband. There was no \ndeficiency. (Tr. 42-44.) \nApplicant testified that she does not have any delinquent or collection accounts \nthat have not been discussed during the hearing. Applicant was referred to GE 11, page \n4, account 3. That account was opened in July 2022, with a balance of $16,130. She was \nasked why the balance was so high. She explained that there were car issues, braces, \nwisdom teeth pulled, and college. (Tr. 44-45.) \nDepartment Counsel asked a series of questions about Applicant\u2019s personal \nfinances and spending habits. Her answers did not prompt any follow-up by Department \nCounsel. Cross-examination ended. Tr. 45-48.) \nRedirect Testimony. Applicant testified that they had mice in the Townhouse. \nThey were getting into the kitchen. It was so bad \u201call the food had to go into containers \njust to keep them out.\u201d When she was trying to qualify for a short sale, she had to be in \ndefault before the lender \u201cwould even talk to [her] about it.\u201d She reiterated that COVID \nrelief would not help her with the loan being underwater. It would lower her payments for \nperhaps six months but would not help sell the house. Applicant provided a third page to \ncomplete AEA. (Tr. 50-53.) \nRecross-examination. No new material information was gleaned during re-cross. \n(Tr. 52-53.) \nApplicant\u2019s relevant credit history follows: \n2011: GE 4, page 7 shows both Townhouse mortgages to be Pays As Agreed. At \npage 6, there is a foreclosure reported where the creditor \u201creclaimed the collateral to settle \ndefaulted mortgage.\u201d This appears to be the Marital Home, the foreclosure of which under \ncourt order was handled by Applicant\u2019s former husband. All other accounts are Pays as \nAgreed. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2021: GE 3, pages 2 and 3 show both Townhouse mortgages past due.

All \nother accounts have no balances past due. \n2023: GE 11, accounts 13 and 18 show both Townhouse mortgages past due. All \nother accounts have no balances past due. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n    Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by her admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. From February 2016, she has been employed full-time by her current \nemployer. Before that, since 2001, she worked for federal contractors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n(b) apply.  \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and,  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant bought the Townhouse in June 2007 for $225,000. It was in a complex, \nand she had neighbors adjoining on either side. It was in a rustic area. She moved in with \nher two sons, then ages four and five. Shortly thereafter, her cohabitant, the father of her \nboys, also took up residence there. She never had any intention of renting out the \nTownhouse. She never refinanced the Townhouse. \nThe purchase price was financed by an 80/20 loan. The down payment of $45,000 \nwas financed by one lender, and the balance of $180,000 was financed by another lender. \nBoth loans were interest-only loans. That meant Applicant did not have to use any of her \nown money to complete the purchase. And she could remain current on her home \npayments by paying the interest only on both loans. It also meant, however, that her \ninterest-only payments would not be applied to reduce the capital amounts of either loan. \nShe was asked why by 2011 the first loan\u2019s principal only decreased by $22 and the \nsecond loan\u2019s principal only decreased by $222. She explained that they were interest-\nonly loans. Very little of her monthly payments reduced the principal. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNot long after Applicant moved in, the financial crisis of 2008 struck. Almost \nimmediately her home loans were underwater. Nevertheless, she planned to do her best \nkeep the Townhouse. But as the housing market continued to slump, she made \nnumerous efforts to do a short sale. The mortgage lenders, however, denied her requests. \nAnd by that time, COVID was in full bloom. So lenders rejected her short sale requests \nand instead recommended she use COVID relief programs. She declined, because those \nprograms would only pause or reduce mortgage payments for a short time but would not \nhelp her underwater loans. She also inquired about doing a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. \nLenders responded that they were not using those because of the President\u2019s COVID \nmandate against such transactions. Asked why she did not refinance the Townhouse, \nshe replied: \u201cHow can you refinance a loan that\u2019s underwater?\u201d \nAt the hearing, Applicant was asked about the current market value of her \nTownhouse. Specifically, she was asked whether an online estimate of between $224,000 \nand $253,000 sounded about right. She said they were too high, that $200,000, or \nperhaps less, was maybe closer. She based her estimates on other townhouses that were \nsold recently in the area. Her opinion of her home\u2019s current value is reliable evidence. \nSee, e.g., Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC v. 3921 Acres of Land, 947 F.3d 1362, 1368-69 \n(11th  Cir. 2020). Using $253,000 as the current value yields a 12% appreciation in 13 \nyears, or less than 1% per year. That is hardly a robust appreciation. Using Applicant\u2019s \nestimate puts the mortgages still underwater.  \nDuring Applicant\u2019s residence in the Townhouse from June 2007 until she and her \nfamily moved out in December 2020, problems developed. Principal of which was an \ninfestation of rodents entering the premises and being in the kitchen. It was so bad that \nshe had to store food stuffs in containers. She plugged up holes and areas of entry and \nused vents, as recommended, but to no avail. In June 2020, she discovered a copperhead \nsnake in her basement. (A neighbor came in and killed it.) She no longer felt safe in the \nTownhouse. \nIn addition to the rodents, the snake, and the decline or stasis in its market value, \nthe Townhouse no longer fit her family\u2019s needs. Her sons are now 19 and 20. Applicant \nagain applied for a short sale. She was told that to qualify, she needed to be in default of \nher mortgages. That is why she stopped paying her mortgages in the spring of 2020. She \ntestified that she had to be in default before the lender \u201cwould even talk to [her] about it.\u201d \nIt is common for lenders to require that a borrower be in default before considering a short \nsale or a foreclosure. See James Chen, What is a Short Sale on a House? Process, \nAlternatives, and Mistakes to Avoid, May 22, 2022. https://www.investopedia.com. The \nrecord is consistent with her testimony. From her clean 2011 credit report there is no past \ndue amount on the Townhouse until her 2021 credit report, about a year after she vacated \nthe Townhouse and stopped paying her mortgages in the spring of 2020. She is now \nworking with the lenders to accomplish a short sale or let the Townhouse go to \nforeclosure. Other than the default status of the Townhouse, her credit reports are \nflawless. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant bought the Townhouse in June 2007. She and her family lived there for \n13 years, and she faithfully paid her mortgages. She only stopped paying the mortgages \nin the spring of 2020, when lenders told her she needed to be in default to qualify for a \nshort sale. In the meantime, Applicant has continued to maintain the Townhouse. She \nand a neighbor mow the small lawn and keep up the outside. It still has water, but she cut \noff the electricity. She is current on all utilities. \nApplicant\u2019s defaults on the Townhouse mortgages were first reported on the 2021 \ncredit report. Those defaults are the only blemishes on her credit history. The 2008 \nfinancial crisis complicated by three years of COVID, we hope, are unlikely to recur. They \nare also conditions \u201clargely beyond\u201d her control. She continued to pay her mortgages, \nuntil told by lenders that she needed to be in default to do a short sale. That was \nresponsible conduct. The unusual adverse circumstances Applicant confronted and how \nshe dealt with them do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. I conclude that her SOR debts are mitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (b). Therefore, \nI find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-b.: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She provided a letter \nfrom an attorney that she retained to resolve this matter, and as of September 2022, she \nwas disputing it in litigation. (Item 2 at 15) \nSubparagraph 1.b, totaling $11,397, is the remaining amount Applicant owed on a \ncar loan after her car was totaled in an accident. (Reply at 1) When she purchased the \ncar in 2013, she could not afford to purchase GAP insurance. (Reply at 1) It is unknown \nfrom the record whether this was the same car accident that she incurred the medical bill, \nas alleged in subparagraph 1.b. Applicant has no plans to pay this debt because it has \nbeen charged off her credit report. (Item 10 at 7) \nApplicant maintains a budget. She has $7,295 in monthly, discretionary income. \n(Item 6 at 8) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems, including her failure to timely file multiple, \nconsecutive years of federal and state income tax returns trigger the application of AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial problems began after her ex-husband, upon whom she \nwas dependent to help make ends meet, became seriously ill and addicted to painkillers \nduring his treatment, subsequently leading to the loss of his job. \nSince Applicant\u2019s salary began steadily increasing in 2018, she has gradually \nbegan satisfying her delinquent debts and catching up on her income tax return filings. In \nthe process, she has crafted a budget, credibly disputed one of the debts by retaining an \nattorney to assist her, and she retained a professional tax preparer to help her file her tax \nreturns. I conclude that the following mitigating conditions are applicable: \n20(a) the behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n20(d) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nCurrently, Applicant\u2019s only outstanding debt is the amount due after her car was \ntotaled in an accident, leaving her unable to pay the difference between what the \ninsurance company reimbursed her, and what she owed on the car note. It certainly would \nhave been prudent for Applicant to have purchased GAP insurance when she bought the \ncar; however, she could not afford it. The fact that the creditor has charged off this debt \nis not mitigating. Any negative inference triggered by her inability to pay this debt before \nand since the creditor charged it off is outweighed when viewed in light of the origins of \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties, her steps to remedy her financial problems, her payment \nof all of the other SOR debts, and her current financial stability. On balance, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, particularly, the circumstances surrounding the origin of the problem \nand the current, significant presence of rehabilitation. \nFindings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has been married to his wife since 2018, and he \nhas a 12-year-old stepson, whom he has raised since his stepson was a toddler. He \nattended technical school courses during his junior and senior years of high school, and \nin 2000, he received a high school diploma from the technical school. He has been \nemployed by a DOD contractor since March 2020. He works in production control and \nrequires a security clearance for his position.

(GE 1-3; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 10-11, 17-20) \nApplicant told the government investigator during his August 2020 background \ninterview that he spent most of his time between 1999 (when he was 18) and 2013 \neither working or partying. His typical week consisted of going out to a bar three to four \nnights, where he would consume seven to eight beers and have a few shots. If he was \nnot at the bar drinking, he was at home smoking marijuana. His testimony described a \ndifferent drinking pattern between 1999 and approximately 2015, when he worked night \nshifts in the restaurant industry. He testified that during this period, he typically \nconsumed one or two cocktails at his workplace after his shifts ended, and then drove to \nhis home, where he would consume more alcohol. He would drink, \u201cMaybe a 6-pack [of \nbeer] and a couple of shots or, you know, maybe more shots and not so many beers.\u201d It \ntypically took eight to ten drinks for him to feel intoxicated, and this pattern occurred five \nto six times a week. (GE 2; Tr. 21-26, 41-42) \nIn 2013, Applicant experienced \u201csome very, very low points\u201d in his life. He quit \nusing drugs after he borrowed money for his drug use and realized \u201cit was time to \nchange [his] life.\u201d He testified that he quit using drugs, stopped drinking alcohol as \nheavily, but he continued to consume between a six-pack to a 12-pack of beer two to \nthree times a week at home. However, during his October 2021 psychological \nevaluation, mentioned below, he stated that after he discontinued using drugs in 2013, \nhis alcohol consumption increased rather than decreased. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 26-27) \nApplicant started taking antidepressant medications in 2013, and he was \nprescribed testosterone medication in 2018. In 2020, he started to experience high and \nlow mood swings. He drank more during the downswings, which occurred \napproximately two to three times a month. Additionally, during the downswings, he often \ndrank to the point that he blacked out, and he was drinking not just to drink, but to \nforget.

It had been his birthday, and he \ndrank 10 to 12 beers and a few shots. He ultimately admitted that he consumed alcohol \nat this level two or three times a month and that he was experiencing alcohol-related \nblackouts two or three times a month. (GE 2; Tr. 28-29) \nIn October 2021, Applicant was referred for an independent psychological \nevaluation by the DOD Consolidated Adjudication Facility (CAF) for the purpose of \nanswering the following question: \u201cDoes the [Applicant] have any medical, psychiatric, \nemotional, or substance use condition which could impair his judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.\u201d In reaching her opinion, the licensed psychologist (LP) conducted a \ntwo-hour interview and administered the Psychological Assessment Inventory (PAI) and \nthe Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI-4). The LP also reviewed and \nrelied upon documents provided by the CAF, including Applicant\u2019s August 2020 \ninterview and his 2018 security clearance application (SCA). The LP determined that \nApplicant met the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, and concluded that his \nprognosis was guarded to fair. She recommended that he refrain from consuming shots \nof hard liquor and continue to limit his drinking. (GE 3) \nApplicant told the LP that, in October 2021, he was drinking three times a week, \nprimarily on the weekends, and consuming a maximum of four to five beers. He blacked \nout from drinking three or four times after his August 2020 interview, and the last time \nhe blacked out was in approximately June 2021. During his blackouts, he had no \nmemory of what occurred until he woke up in the morning. (GE 3) \nApplicant testified that he stopped drinking just before the DOD evaluation. \nHowever, at the hearing, he disclosed that he consumes \u201c[m]aybe a beer or two here \nand there.\u201d He testified that he had not been intoxicated since October 2021, and the \nmost he has consumed at one time since the 2021 evaluation is four beers. Before the \nhearing date, he consumed two beers, at home, eight or nine days earlier over the \nweekend. He currently drinks alcohol two to three times a month. (Tr. 26-40) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he reduced his alcohol consumption in 2021, \nbecause he was afraid of losing his wife and stepson. He also told the LP that he \nreduced his drinking, because he did not want to risk hurting himself or anyone else. \nWhen Applicant changed his level of alcohol consumption, he started going to the gym \nmore, helping his stepson practice baseball, and took up woodworking as a hobby. \nApplicant disclosed to the government investigator that his wife expressed concern that \nhe becomes angry when he is intoxicated. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 36-40, 44) \nApplicant has never attended an alcohol-treatment program or Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings. He did not obtain an updated evaluation prior to the \nhearing. He received a copy of the DOD evaluation in September 2022, and at that time \nhe considered discontinuing all consumption of alcohol, because he was concerned \nabout losing his job and his clearance.

He hoped that after he finished the pledge, he would \nhave a better handle on his alcohol consumption. In October 2021, he told the LP that \nhe discontinued the 75-day challenge after approximately 10 days due to the challenge \nof not eating sugar. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr.40, 44-45, 47-48) \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant was asked about his history of driving while \nintoxicated. He claimed that if he had ever driven over the legal limit, it was after \nconsuming two to three drinks when he was younger and still working in the restaurant \nindustry. However, he told the DOD evaluator that he had driven while intoxicated two \nyears prior to his October 2021 evaluation. He has never been arrested for alcohol-\nrelated issues. The issue regarding Applicant driving while intoxicated was not alleged \nin the SOR and will not be considered as disqualifying conduct; however, it may be \nconsidered in assessing mitigation and whole-person applicability. (Tr. 3, 20, 46) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following two \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. Two are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \nApplicant has admitted to a history of consuming alcohol in excess and to the \npoint of intoxication from 1999 to at least October 2021. He experienced multiple \nblackouts between 2000 and June 2021, and he drove under the influence of alcohol as \nrecently as 2019. In August 2020, he disclosed during his interview with a government \ninvestigator that his alcohol consumption was negatively affecting his relationship with \nhis wife and causing him to experience blackouts. As a result, he was referred for a \npsychological evaluation, and he was subsequently diagnosed by a duly qualified \nprofessional with Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s diagnosis, he continues to consume alcohol, in a reduced \namount, and denies that he has been intoxicated or \u201cblacked out\u201d since October 2021. \nHe has not sought treatment or attended AA, nor did he provide documentation or \ncorroborating testimony of his modified behavior. Other than his testimony, he \npresented no evidence of a pattern of responsible use of alcohol. Given his lengthy \nhistory of abusing alcohol, his inconsistent testimony regarding driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol, and his relatively short period of modified behavior, I have lingering \nconcerns regarding his suitability to hold a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) do \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings  \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption: \nAGAINST Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are established by his admissions in his Answer; his March 2021 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA); and credit reports from July 2021, February 2022, \nAugust 2022, and May 2023. All of the SOR debts are reported on the July 2021 credit \nbureau report. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.e are reported on the February 2022 credit bureau report. \nOnly SOR \u00b6 3.d is reported on the August 2022 and May 2023 credit bureau reports. \n(Answer; Tr. at 17-18, 31; GE 1, 3-6) \nApplicant stated that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.f were credit cards that were fraudulently \nopened in his name, and he did not learn about them until he underwent the security \nclearance process in 2021 and the background investigator informed him about them.

He stated that he was communicating with the \ncreditor for SOR \u00b6 3.d and attempting to recoup the money he paid to resolve that debt \nbecause he did not recognize it as his, as he has only one credit card with this same \ncreditor. He also stated that he has had ongoing issues with not receiving medical bills \nrelated to one of his child\u2019s frequent visits to various doctors for a medical condition, and \nthat the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 3.a was one such bill. He acknowledged that he was \npreviously not the best at monitoring his credit report. (Tr. at 17-18, 31-33, 49-61) \nApplicant stated that he paid all the SOR debts prior to receiving the SOR. He \nprovided documentation reflecting that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.c and 3.e-f are resolved \nas of June 2023; he resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.f in 2021; and he disputed the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 3.b in June 2023.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited \nto, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;\u201d and \n\u201c(c) individual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d \nApplicant was arrested in 2019 and charged with five felony offenses, and he pled \nguilty to larceny of checks and identity theft. Although he completed probation, he is still \non a deferred sentence until February 2025. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and 31(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides the following relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nI recognize that this is Applicant\u2019s sole criminal offense, four years have since \npassed, and he is endeavoring to not let this incident define him. He also disclosed this \ninformation on his 2021 security clearance application, and he was candid, sincere, and \nremorseful at the hearing and he accepted responsibility for his actions. I commend his \nmentorship as a children\u2019s sports coach. However, he is still on a deferred sentence until \nFebruary 2025 for his felony conviction. As such, I find that not enough time has elapsed \nsince his criminal behavior and without recurrence of criminal activity, and the record \nevidence still casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) \nand 32(d) are not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nApplicant displayed untrustworthiness, questionable judgment, and unreliability, \nwhich led to his 2019 conviction and general discharge under honorable conditions for \nmisconduct. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \u00b6 AG 17 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nFor the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, I find that \u00b6\u00b6 AG \n17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are not established. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his debts. The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. He paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.c and \n3.e-f, and he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.b in June 2023. He also paid the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 3.f in 2021, before the SOR. He does not have any other delinquent debts. Although he \nhas not received financial counseling, he and his wife utilize a budget to track their \nexpenses. His finances are under control, and they do not continue to cast doubt on his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(e) are \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, E, and F in \nmy whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but he did not mitigate \nthe criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.f: \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR identified five delinquent debts totaling approximately $27,500. Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under this guideline. Credit reports of the Applicant dated April 14, 2020; July 8, 2021; January 13, 2022; and August 5, 2022, confirm that at one time he was indebted to each of the creditors listed in the SOR.

Credit reports \nof the Applicant dated April 14, 2020; July 8, 2021; January 13, 2022; and August 5, \n2022, confirm that at one time he was indebted to each of the creditors listed in the \nSOR.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6.) \nApplicant has never applied for a security clearance before. He began working \nfor his current employer in July 2015. A security clearance was not required for the \nposition that he was originally hired for. As time passed, his good job performance has \noffered him more opportunities if he possesses a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties were caused by his implusive and \nirresponsible purchases and not living within a budget. Applicant explained that he \nprovides all financial support for his three children and his girlfriend who is house wife \nand stay-at-home mother. He earns $25 hourly or about $1,000 weekly. He now \nrealizes that in order to be eligible for a security clearance he must live within his \nmeans, follow a budget, and make responsible purchases. \nApplicant recently hired a Credit Repair Agency to assist him in negotiating \nsettlements for his delinquent debts, and to help in getting his debts paid off. His fee for \ntheir services is $2,040. He put an initial deposit of $200 towards this fee and pays \nthem $150.33 on the tenth of every month for twelve consecutive months. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe following delinquent debts listed in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $17,738 for an account \nthat was charged off. In 2016, he purchased a new 2016 Electric Kia for $30, 818, that \nhe was financing. Four months after purchasing the car, he realized that he could not \nafford to continue making the $500 monthly payments, and he did not have access to a \ncharging station. Applicant called the creditor and asked them to pick up the car. They \ntold him to stop making payments on the account first. He stopped making payments, \nand the car was eventually repossessed and sold at auction. Applicant owes the \ndeficiency amount left on the loan after the sale. The debt remains owing. (Tr. p. 35, \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n1.b. Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $950 for an account \nthat was charged off. He explained that he went to a dentist and applied for their credit \ncard. This was for the dental bill.  Applicant paid the debt off in September 2022.  (Tr. p. \n39 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \n1.c. Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $383 for an account \nthat was placed for collection. This is car insurance that Applicant purchased. He \ncancelled it because he found a cheaper insurance. Applicant paid off the debt on May \n20, 2022.  (Tr. p. 41, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Government Exhibit 6.) \n1.d. Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $172 for an account \nthat was placed for collection. Applicant does not remember what the debt was for but \ndoes know that he settled the debt for $126.16 on May 20, 2022. (Tr, pp. 41-42, and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \n1.e. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $8,246 for the purchase \nof a used Nissan Ultima that he purchased in March 2017. The account was placed for \ncollection. Applicant explained that he had no insurance on the car when he was in a \ncar accident which totaled the car in May 2017. Following the car accident, the tow \ntruck dropped the car off at his apartment. It was being financed through General \nMotors. The car was sold at auction for scraps. Applicant owed the deficiency amount \nof $8,000. Applicant confirms that the creditor plans to send him a Form 1099 C. (Tr. \npp. 42-46.) An excerpt from Applicant\u2019s Experian credit report indicates that it was \n\u201clegally paid in full for less that the full balance\u201d. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nA letter of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisor on 2nd  shift indicates that\nApplicant has high standards.  He displays excellent work ethics, and always does what \nis right for his team and the company.  He is a delight to work with and is extremely \ntrustworthy.

(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties due to his irresponsibility. His \nactions or inactions both demonstrate a history of not addressing his debt and/or an \ninability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n5 \n   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt that he could not afford to pay. It was only \nafter receiving the SOR that he made some effort to resolve his debts. His financial \nirresponsibility and inaction casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. Applicant now realizes his mistakes of the past and understands that \nhe must be financially responsible and live within his means if he is to obtain a security \nclearance in the future. Applicant has recently hired a Credit Repair Agency to assist \nhim with his finances. It would also be beneficial for Applicant to take some finance \nclasses to improve his ability to control his spending and to make rational and \nreasonable decisions. At this time, he has not sufficiently resolved his delinquent debt, \nnor has he demonstrated a systematic method of payment. He must work diligently to \nimprove his financial status and to achieve a security clearance. At this time, Applicant \nneeds more time to show the Government that he will properly resolve his financial \ndelinquencies with regular systematic payments and consistency. \nNone of the \nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant has made a \ngood faith effort to resolve his debts. Overall, Applicant has a good employment record, \nis well liked on the job, and has potential in the future if he changes his ways. He must \nshow progress towards properly managing his finances. This means paying his bills on \ntime and living within his means. Applicant still owes a significant amount of money to \none of his creditors, and he has yet begun to resolve the debt. There is insufficient \nevidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to \nestablish mitigation of the government security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with his commitment to show financial responsibility, \nsometime in the future he may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and \naccess classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., and 1.e.  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",
