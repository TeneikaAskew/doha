The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn August 16, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on October 27, \n2021. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.

The case was \nassigned to me on February 9, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m through 1.s. She failed to provide \na response to \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l. The lack of response will be treated as denials. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014 and a real estate \nlicense in approximately 2016. Applicant attended two universities and a community \ncollege from 2009 through 2014, and another college in 2016, which she financed at least \npartially through student loans. She worked part-time jobs from September 2007 to \nAugust 2017. From August 2017 to March 2020 Applicant worked full-time as a leasing \nconsultant. Applicant\u2019s income increased significantly in April 2020, when she started \nworking in an administrative position for a defense contractor. Applicant has never been \nmarried and has no children. (Items 2, 3) \nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent accounts totaling $53,623 including nine student \nloan accounts ($43,974), six consumer accounts ($7,580) and four medical accounts \n($2,069). (Item 1) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in April 2020. She \ndisclosed delinquent debts estimated at $10,000 and acknowledged defaulting on her \nstudent loans. Applicant attributed her financial issues to hardship during college that \nbegan in May 2012 and underemployment. She reported changing employment to \nincrease her income, working to settle the debts in collection, and to getting her student \nloans out of default. (Item 2) \nDuring an August 2020 background interview, Applicant acknowledged nine \nstudent loan accounts totaling $43,974 were placed for collection in the specific amounts \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j. She also acknowledged the \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d ($4,967) was incurred to pay for cosmetic surgery in 2013, but \ndid not recall if she made a few payments on the account, and did not recall further details. \nApplicant said she did not recall the debts subsequently alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.q, and \n1.s, but agreed the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k was probably hers. She believed the \ndelinquent accounts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.r were for hospitalizations and \nmedical appointments from December 2018 to April 2019, stated a credit collection \ncompany recently contacted her, and that she was awaiting written correspondence \nregarding settlement options. Applicant reported the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and \n1.p were incurred buying clothes and that she did not recall if she had made payments \non the accounts. Applicant attributed the delinquent accounts to underemployment, \nexacerbated by the requirement to pay a derelict college roommate\u2019s expenses for nine \nmonths, and legal expenses to contest charges she operated a vehicle under the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ninfluence of drugs or alcohol in 2019. Applicant reported a significant increase in income \nwhen she started work for a defense contractor in April 2020 and that she was more \nmature. She said the pay increase would enable her to begin paying the delinquent debt \nand stated her intent to pay all delinquent debts. (Item 3) \nIn her August 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debts alleged at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.m to 1.s remained delinquent. She acknowledged several past closed accounts, and \nreported aggressive efforts to improve her financial condition since August 2020. She \nclaimed to have paid all collections, medical debts and other accounts, and said her \nanswer included documentary evidence reflecting a zero balance for the accounts. The \nonly documentary evidence attached to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is an undated two-\npage document which reflects account details for a student loan account not alleged as \ndelinquent in the SOR. It appears this student loan was obtained in December 2017, had \na reported balance of $3,699 as of May 31, 2021, and has been reported as current since \nMarch 2020. The student loans alleged as delinquent in the SOR were obtained from \n2009 to 2013. Applicant provided no documents reflecting payment on any debt alleged \nin the SOR. (Item 1) \nCredit records submitted by the Government dated July 28, 2020, reflect the 19 \ndelinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.s totaling $53,623. Credit records \nsubmitted by the Government dated October 4, 2021, reflect 13 delinquent accounts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.k, and 1.p totaling $50,503 including nine student loan \naccounts ($43,974), and three consumer accounts ($6,529). The October 2021 credit \nreport reflects Applicant resolved two delinquent medical accounts totaling $300 in June \n2020 and June 2021. (Items 4, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to 2012 when she was a \ncollege student. Credit records reflect Applicant as delinquent on the 19 accounts alleged \nin the SOR totaling $53,623. In her 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed defaulting on her \nstudent loans and reported other delinquent debts estimated at $10,000. During a \nbackground interview, Applicant acknowledged delinquent student loans, consumer and \nmedical accounts in the amounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j, 1.l to 1.p, 1.r, and also \nacknowledged the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k was probably hers. In her answer to the \nSOR, Applicant denied the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m to 1.s remained delinquent, \nstating she paid those debts in full after her background investigation commenced in \nAugust 2020, but provided no documentary evidence of any payment on any debt alleged \nin the SOR or that any debt alleged in the SOR has been resolved. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant's conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) \nbecause she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are long-standing and ongoing. She has provided \nno documentary evidence of payment on any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the \nSOR, while recent credit records reflect payment of only two delinquent medical debts \nand that at least $50,503 of the $53,623 in delinquent debt alleged in the SOR remains \nunresolved. She receives partial mitigating credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because many of her \ndebts resulted from underemployment and medical treatment and as such constitute \nconditions largely beyond her control. However, there is no evidence Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. During the background interview, she \nacknowledged most of the delinquent accounts were hers, but had limited recollection of \nthe accounts and her actions including whether she made any payments on any of the \ndelinquent accounts, and has not submitted any evidence she acted responsibly. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply, because there is no evidence Applicant has received \nfinancial counseling or that the problem is under control or being resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply. Applicant reported efforts to resolve the delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR by seeking and accepting a higher paying job in April 2020 \nand claimed to pay a number of the delinquent accounts between August 2020 and \nAugust 2021. Yet, she submitted no documentary evidence of payments on any \ndelinquent accounts, and a recent credit report reflects Applicant resolved only two \ndelinquent medical accounts totaling $300. There is insufficient information to establish \nthat Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts. The timing of Applicant\u2019s \nactions including repayment of delinquent debts only after submitting her SCA, impacts \nupon the degree to which the mitigating factors apply. See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at \n5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). It is well settled that waiting to pay legitimate debts until forced \nto do so by the security clearance process does not constitute good-faith debt resolution. \nSee ISCR Case No. 10-05909 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). \nApplicant claimed she resolved four medical accounts that are no longer on her \ncredit report. The October 2021 credit report reflects she resolved two delinquent medical \naccounts. Although, Applicant failed to provide other documentary evidence, and these \ndebts may have fallen off her credit report for other reasons, I have given her credit for \nthem and find in her favor on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.r. \nApplicant\u2019s overall financial conduct casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1)\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has been aware for many years that she defaulted on her student loans \nand had multiple delinquent accounts. Applicant accumulated a large amount of \ndelinquent debt in the past that she has failed to pay. Although Applicant has apparently \nmade progress towards resolving some of her financial delinquencies, her credit records \nreflect more than $50,000 in delinquent debt. Applicant had an opportunity to provide \nmore recent information about the current status of her remaining debts, but did not. She \ndoes not have a reliable financial track record and failed to meet her burden of persuasion. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \nraised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.o: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor, employed since March 2021. When he completed his SCA, he was employed by a Government contractor as a cyber-security consultant. He was unemployed for periods while attending undergraduate and graduate schools.

The FORM marked the \nSOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR as GEs 1 and 2, however, they are already part \nof the record. The case was assigned to me on May 13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor, employed since \nMarch 2021. When he completed his SCA, he was employed by a Government contractor \nas a cyber-security consultant. He was unemployed for periods while attending \nundergraduate and graduate schools.

He was granted a secret security clearance in \n2015. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is indebted on five student loans \nplaced for collections, totaling $22,663 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, and 1.f); a charged-off credit \naccount totaling $3,037 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and two medical collection accounts totaling $1,541 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h). Applicant admitted all of the delinquent accounts except for one \nmedical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h), which he denied as \u201cno longer delinquent.\u201d (Ans.) The record \nevidence is sufficient to support the SOR allegations. \nWhen he completed his SCA, the only delinquencies Applicant reported were \n$26,000 in student loans. He noted that he was making payments through a wage \ngarnishment. In his personal subject interview (PSI) by a security investigator, he noted \nthat although he had a garnishment order from March to May 2020, the garnished amount \nwas refunded to him, possibly due to pandemic relief. He was unaware that the student \nloans were in a collection status and believed his loans were never delinquent. (GE 6) \nHis 2020 credit report shows the student loan accounts as past due since 2017, and sold \nor transferred by Fedloan, and placed for collections by the U.S. Department of Education \nin about 2020. (GE 7) \nThe charged-off credit account was placed for collection in about October 2020. \n(GE 7) Applicant was unaware of the account when interviewed, but noted an intent to \ninvestigate it and pay it if necessary. (GE 6) The two medical debts were placed for \ncollections in about 2020. (GE 7) Applicant was unaware of the debts when he was \ninterviewed. In his Answer to the SOR, he claimed that one medical debt was no longer \ndelinquent, but he provided no evidence in support of his claim. \nIn his PSI, Applicant acknowledged the debts, and claimed that he was \u201cin pretty \ngood shape financially.\u201d He stated that he earns about $84,000 per year gross, $54,000 \nnet; has about $3,025 in monthly expenses; and had about $340,000 in home value and \na checking account with $3,500.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe documentary evidence in the record and Applicant\u2019s admissions are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has a history of \nnot responsibly meeting financial obligations. He has done little to address his debts \ndespite his apparent ability to pay, or to take appropriate action to investigate and resolve \ndelinquent debts. The guideline encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who \nis financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in \nhandling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period and that he can obtain and maintain \na measure of financial responsibility. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial responsibility is questionable. He has not shown \nevidence of attempts to inquire into his debts, or sufficient action to resolve them. No \nmitigation credit is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s student \nloans, employment history, and current financial status. Because he requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to question him about the circumstances \nthat led to his debts or any action he may have taken to address them. See ISCR Case \nNo. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person, including exceptions available under Appendix C of SEAD \n4. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial \ndelinquencies. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nGregg A.

His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, \nI make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 72-year-old employee of a federal contractor with duties as a human \nresources (HR) generalist. He began working at his present job in July 2019. He served \nin the U.S. Army from 1972 to 1976, and he received an honorable discharge. He holds \na master\u2019s degree. He is married for the second time and has three adult children, \nincluding two stepchildren. He provided financial support for both his stepson and \nstepdaughter to attend college, including paying for their student loans. (Tr. 6, 17-18, 21, \n26, 29-30, 42-43; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent accounts (credit cards) totaling approximately \n$33,243. The debts are established by credit reports from November 2019, February \n2021, and September 2021; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with an \ninvestigator in December 2019; his responses to DOHA interrogatories in December \n2020; and his SOR admissions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c). (GE 2-6; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in 2016. He and his wife opened a women\u2019s \nboutique in a small western tourist town in 2014. Applicant was also employed as a \nconsultant with the title of career coach. In 2016, he was grossing about $65,000 per year \nfrom this work. Applicant described the profitability of the business between 2014 and \n2017 as making enough money to keep the place open. That changed in March 2016 \nwhen Applicant, with very short notice, was laid off from his consulting job. He and his \nwife scrambled to take several part-time jobs in order to make ends meet. They continued \nthis until approximately May 2017 when they decided to close the boutique. He was hired \nfor an HR position in a different location so they sold their condominium and moved in \nOctober 2017. (Tr. 19-20; GE 3; Answer to SOR)  \nApplicant used credit cards to fund the boutique business. This was necessary in \norder to pay for new inventory several times a year. The three SOR debts are credit cards \nused to finance their business. There were at least four other credit cards used by \nApplicant for the same purpose that also became delinquent, but he was able to settle \nthose debts with the creditors for less than the full amount. These four debts were not \nalleged in the SOR and will not be considered by me for disqualification purposes, but I \nmay consider the evidence as it relates to the application of any mitigating conditions or \nduring my assessment of the whole-person factors.

All three debts are to the same \ncreditor. Applicant claims he was in contact with this creditor (or the resulting collection \ncompanies) at various time between 2017 and 2019. No documentation supports this \nassertion. He further claims that he offered to settle the debts but the creditor refused his \noffer by demanding either full payment or monthly payments of $300 to $400 on each \ndebt. Applicant stated he could not meet those demands because he was helping to pay \nfor his stepchildren and his wife\u2019s college expenses. He has not contacted the creditor \nsince 2019, even though he stated he would do so in his December 2020 response to \ninterrogatories, and in his SOR answer in June 2021. He further stated that he did not \nuse some of the $110,000 proceeds from the sale of his condominium in October 2017 \nto pay the SOR debts because he had other priorities, such as paying some of his other \ndebts and paying his stepchildren\u2019s college and living expenses. These three debts are \nstill unpaid, and Applicant\u2019s plan is to let them fall off his credit report after seven years \nand take advantage of their unenforceability when the state\u2019s statute of limitation for the \ncollection of debts passes. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 19, 20-21, 26, 33, 40-43; GE \n3; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant testified that his gross annual income is approximately $82,000 from his \njob and $15,000 from his social security pension. His wife\u2019s current income is \napproximately $50,000 annually. He recently bought a home and his monthly mortgage \npayments are $1,473. He typically has approximately $500 left over at the end of the \nmonth after paying all his bills. He has approximately $3,000 in his retirement account \nand his wife has between $6,000 and $7,000. They have no other savings account. He is \ncurrent on all his other debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling. (Tr. 36-39) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred three delinquent debts, which he used to fund his boutique \nbusiness. While Applicant was unable to pay the debts at certain times, since becoming \nfinancially solvent, he has been unwilling to pay them. I find all the disqualifying conditions \nare raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and he has not made any \npayments toward them. While he may not engage in a retail business again, his inaction \ntowards resolving these debts casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s business failure is a condition beyond his control. However, his choice \nto pay his stepchildren\u2019s college education rather than paying his own delinquent debts \nwas not a condition beyond his control. Additionally, he did not act responsibly concerning \nthe debts when he stopped attempting to work out a payment plan with the creditor, and \nwhen he chose not to use some of his condominium-sale proceeds to pay the debts. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. Additionally, he stated \nthat his plan to deal with these debts was to do nothing\u2014in other words\u2014he plans to let \nthem become legally unenforceable by operation of law. While this may be an appropriate \noption to take viewed through a financial prism, it does not equate to acting responsibly \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand in good faith and puts into question his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, his business failure, his settlement of at \nleast four non-SOR debts related to his business, and his family circumstances. However, \nI also considered that he did not attempt to pay his debts after the sale of his condominium \nand has not taken any other action to resolve his delinquent debt. He has not established \na meaningful track record of debt management, and his plan to let the statute of limitations \nrun on his debts causes me to question his reliability and willingness to resolve his debts \nin the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered \nthe exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated \nJune 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has a high school diploma and took some technical \ncourses in 2014 and 2015, but did not earn an additional degree. He was married in \n2007, but he has been separated from his spouse since 2012.

(Tr. 17-20, 46, 49; GE 1, 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $53,000. These delinquencies consisted of automobile loans, a \ntelecommunications debt, and a utility debt. Applicant admitted all of the SOR \nallegations with additional comment. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. \n(Answer; GE 1-5) \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to a lack of employment and his 2012 \nseparation from his estranged spouse. He had a break in employment from May 2019 \nuntil December 2019. He has been employed since December 2019 and earns about \n$80,000 annually. He worked as a government contractor in Country A from 2019 until \nabout May 2021. His girlfriend, with whom he shares income and expenses, earns \nabout $2,200 per month since March 2022. From 2017 until 2018, he hired and paid a \ndebt consolidation company to help him resolve his delinquencies. He stopped using \nthis company because he was not happy with the work they were doing. When he \nreturned to the U.S. from Country A, he had about $17,000 to $18,000 in his savings \naccount, some of which he claimed he used to pay his delinquencies. At the hearing, he \nclaimed that he had about $2,000 in his savings account. He claimed he saves about \n$1,000 per month after paying all his bills, but does not follow a written budget. (Tr. 19-\n21, 24-25, 39-41, 46, 49-50; Answer; GE 1, 2) \nThe $12,120 automobile loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not been resolved. \nApplicant opened this account in 2017 to purchase a vehicle on credit. Because of a \nlack of employment, he could not afford the monthly payments. The last payment he \nmade on this account was in December 2018. At about this time he voluntarily \nsurrendered the vehicle. In the beginning of 2020, he contacted the creditor to make a \npayment arrangement, but was unable to come to an agreement on one. (Tr. 21-24, 39; \nAnswer; GE 2-5) \nThe $10,015 automobile loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b has not been resolved. \nApplicant co-signed on this account to purchase a vehicle for his estranged spouse in \n2011. He has disputed this debt because he believes his wife should be responsible for \nit and because the debt was old. The separation agreement between him and his \nestranged spouse does not provide that his estranged spouse is solely responsible for \nthis debt. Applicant is jointly and severally responsible for the debt. He has not made \nany payment arrangements or payments on this debt after it became delinquent.

At the \nhearing, Applicant disputed owing this debt because he believed his estranged wife \nshould be responsible for it. He provided no evidence that any separation agreement \nprovided that his estranged spouse is solely responsible for this debt. At hearing, he \ntestified that he did not know about this debt, but during his 2019 security interview, he \ntold an investigator that it was for an auto loan and that he and his estranged spouse \npurchased the vehicle. He and his estranged wife are jointly and severally liable for the \ndebt. He has not made any payment arrangements or payments on this debt after it \nbecame delinquent. (Tr. 34-37, 39; Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe $885 telecommunications debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d has not been resolved. \nThis debt is Applicant and his estranged spouse\u2019s joint debt. Applicant claimed that he \npaid this debt in about August 2021, but he provided no documentation to corroborate \nthis claim. (Tr. 37, 39, 50; Answer; GE 1-3) \nThe $469 utility debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e has not been resolved. Applicant \nclaimed that he paid this debt in about August 2021, but he provided no documentation \nto corroborate this claim. (Tr. 37-39, 50-51; Answer; GE 3-5) \nThe $23,115 automobile loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f has been resolved. Applicant \nfell behind on his payments on this account in 2018 and voluntarily surrendered it. He \nsettled this account in April 2021 by paying the creditor a lump sum of $4,800. (Tr. 25-\n30, 39; GE 1-5) \nApplicant purchased a vehicle in May 2021 for about $8,000. In October 2021, he \ntraded this vehicle in for the purchase of another, used vehicle. He makes payments of \nabout $445 per month on the vehicle he purchased in October 2021. The balance on \nthis account was about $16,400.1 (Tr. 45-48; GE 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n1 Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s purchase of a vehicle, cannot be \nused for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the application of mitigating \nconditions and for the whole-person analysis. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had six delinquent debts totaling about $53,000 that he has been \ndelinquent on for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nApplicant satisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f through a lump sum payment prior to the \nissuance of the SOR. I find in favor of Applicant with respect to that allegation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile Applicant has resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through payment, he has not \nprovided sufficient evidence that the other SOR debts are resolved. His financial issues \nare ongoing and I cannot find they are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose as a result of a loss of employment. These \nconditions were beyond his control. However, he must also show that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances with respect to these debts. While he hired a debt \nconsolidation company from 2017 to 2018 to assist him in settling his delinquencies, he \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence that he meaningfully addressed all but one of the \nSOR debts. Despite having unaddressed financial delinquencies, he spent about $8,000 \nto purchase a vehicle in 2021. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nDespite resolving one of the SOR debts though payment, Applicant\u2019s failure to \nprovide sufficient evidence that he resolved his remaining SOR debts makes AG \u00b6 20(d) \nonly partly applicable. Even if the debt consolidation company he hired provided \nfinancial counseling and was a legitimate and credible source thereof, the lack of \nmeaningful resolution of his overall delinquencies makes AG \u00b6 20(c) inapplicable \nbecause he has not shown that his financial problems are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. \nApplicant disputed owing some of the SOR debts. One basis for his dispute was \nthat he thought his estranged wife should be responsible for the debts. However, the \nevidence is that Applicant is jointly and severally liable for any debts that he claimed his \nwife is responsible. Another basis Applicant provided to dispute his SOR debts is that \nthe debts are old. There is insufficient evidence to show that the statute of limitations \nhas run on any of the SOR debts. Regardless, the Appeal Board has \u201cheld that reliance \non a state's statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve \nfinancial difficulties and is of limited mitigative value.\u201d ISCR No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 26, 2016) (citing ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008)). \nFinally, Applicant claimed that he does not think he owes the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nand 1.d because he thinks he paid the debts in full. However, he provided no evidence \nthat he disputed the debt with the creditor or credit reporting agencies or that he \notherwise attempted to resolve the debt. He also provided no documentary proof of \npayment. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the \nresolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2016). As the bases of his disputes are not reasonable or are not substantiated by \ndocumented proof, AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nAs none of the mitigating factors is fully applicable, Applicant\u2019s financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

He is married and has four children. He has a \nMaster\u2019s degree. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Cloud Architect. He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant has no prior military service. \nHe began working for his current \nemployer in May 2019. He was granted an interim Top Secret security clearance on \nMay 7, 2020. (Government Exhibit 9.) \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this guideline. Applicant \nhas a long history of marijuana use. From about 2004 until at least August 2021, \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency. \nHe also used \nmarijuana while possessing a security clearance from May 2020 to at least August \n2021. In about March 2020 and August 2021, Applicant stated that he intended to \ncontinue using marijuana as prescribed to him by his licensed physician. (Government \nExhibits 2 through 9, except Government Exhibit 6.) \nIn 2010, Applicant was diagnosed with eye disease. Applicant stated that over \nthe years, he has had many care providers that have tried multiple ophthalmic \nmedications to help his condition, but that his attacks subsided and his eye pressure \nstabilized only after he started using medicinal marijuana in 2018. Applicant indicates \nthat since August 2018 to at least January 2021, he has been under the care of Cheryl \nWilliams, MD., of Herban Medical Solutions. \nApplicant was prescribed medicinal \nmarijuana for glaucoma and degenerative eye condition. Applicant used the marijuana \ndaily. Applicant provided documentary evidence from his physician approving treatment \nof his eye conditions with cannabis on August 22, 2018, with renewals in September \n2019, and September 2020. (Government Exhibit 5.) \nIn his interrogatories dated August 2, 2021, Applicant answered, \u201cYes\u201d, to the \nquestion that asked him if he has decided to stop using substances prohibited under \nFederal law. (Government Exhibit 6.)

(Government Exhibits 2 through 9, \nexcept Government Exhibit 6.)    \nWhile marijuana use may have been legalized under certain state laws, it \nremains illegal under Federal law that governs the requirements to qualify for access to \nclassified information. Marijuana use is strictly prohibited under Federal law. It is also \nagainst DoD policy and defense contractor regulations. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains four conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position, and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant has used marijuana \nnumerous times, over a seventeen-year period, from 2004 to at least 2021. He used it \nbefore being hired by a defense contractor, after being hired by a defense contractor, \nand after being granted a security clearance, disregarding DoD policy and Federal law. \nHe used it multiple times for about a fourteen-month period, after having been granted a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant should know that the use of marijuana is against Federal \nlaw and prohibited by the Defense Department in any form or fashion. Applicant\u2019s willful \ndisregard for complying with laws, rules, and regulations raises significant questions \nabout his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live his life to his \nconvenience, and has disregarded the law. Knowing that the use of marijuana is illegal, \nApplicant has disregarded the law and used it anyway. Under the particular facts of this \ncase, Applicant does not show the requisite character or judgment of someone who has \nthe maturity, integrity, good judgment, and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. At this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to \nclassified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not demonstrated the level \nof maturity needed for access to classified information. This is not an individual in \nwhom the Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. In this case, Applicant \nis not subject to random drug tests and so no one knows when he has marijuana in his \nsystem. This is dangerous and unacceptable. Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his conduct. He is not qualified for access to classified information, \nand does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.d. \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1989 until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2011, during which he had nine years of sea service and almost four years of foreign service. He is attending college with a view toward a bachelor\u2019s degree. He married in 2008 and divorced in 2013. He has a 32-year-old child. He is living with his girlfriend. (Tr. at 18- 22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE P-S) Applicant had several periods of unemployment and underemployment from 2014, when his then employer lost a contract, until he obtained his current job in June 2019. He also had severe medical problems that left him hospitalized and unable to work for extended periods. He was treated for prostate cancer in 2017. He had blood- clot problems with his legs, resulting in six operations over a two-year period from about 2018 to 2020. Both legs were eventually amputated, one above the knee and one below. One of his legs became infected, and he had an extended hospital stay to treat it. He continues to have problems, with another surgery in October 2021. He has a 100% disability rating from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and he receives $3,448 per month in disability pay.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 18, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The SOR has two \u00b6 1.k allegations. Rather than remarking the SOR, \nthey will be referred to as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k(1) and 1.k(2). Applicant responded to the SOR on \nJuly 1, 2021, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to another administrative judge on January 6, 2022, and reassigned to me on \nJanuary 14, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on February 17, 2022.

He served on active \nduty in the U.S. Navy from 1989 until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2011, \nduring which he had nine years of sea service and almost four years of foreign service. \nHe is attending college with a view toward a bachelor\u2019s degree. He married in 2008 and \ndivorced in 2013. He has a 32-year-old child. He is living with his girlfriend. (Tr. at 18-\n22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE P-S) \nApplicant had several periods of unemployment and underemployment from \n2014, when his then employer lost a contract, until he obtained his current job in June \n2019. He also had severe medical problems that left him hospitalized and unable to \nwork for extended periods. He was treated for prostate cancer in 2017. He had blood-\nclot problems with his legs, resulting in six operations over a two-year period from about \n2018 to 2020. Both legs were eventually amputated, one above the knee and one \nbelow. One of his legs became infected, and he had an extended hospital stay to treat \nit. He continues to have problems, with another surgery in October 2021. He has a \n100% disability rating from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and he \nreceives $3,448 per month in disability pay. The VA determined that the effective date \nof when he became totally and permanently disabled due to his service-connected \ndisabilities was in June 2020 (Tr. at 16-17, 20-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, \n2; AE R, S) \nApplicant was not able to meet all of his financial obligations. Debts became \ndelinquent; he lost his home to foreclosure; a car was repossessed; and he did not file \nall of his federal and state income tax returns when they were due. The SOR alleges the \nunfiled returns and 17 delinquent debts. However, the $4,956 delinquent debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.k(1) are duplicate accounts. Except as specifically addressed \nbelow, the debts are established through credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE B) \nApplicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due \nfor tax years 2016 and 2018. He stated that he was having money issues, and he did \nnot file the returns if he thought he would owe money. He filed his returns for 2017 on \ntime. An IRS account transcript for tax year 2016, obtained on January 25, 2022, \nindicated that no return had been filed. He stated: \u201cI did my 2016 taxes online and \nthought it was done, I did not know I had to mail my taxes in. That was the confusion.\u201d \nHe submitted undated federal and state income tax returns for 2016, that indicated he \nowed the IRS $399 and his state $1,215. Those figures do not include additional \ninterest and penalties. He did not submit any proof that he paid the taxes.

(Tr. at 39; AE D) \nThe IRS received Applicant\u2019s 2018 federal income tax return on March 7, 2020. A \nJanuary 2022 IRS account transcript for tax year 2018 indicated that he owed $1,671, \nwhich includes penalties and interest. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE E) \nIn January 2022, Applicant entered into a payment agreement with his state to \npay $8,163 in back taxes. He agreed to pay $248 per month for 36 months, with the first \npayment due by February 15, 2022. He plans to set up a payment agreement with the \nIRS. (Tr. at 39-40; AE I) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges $7,677 owed on a charged-off account to a credit union. The \ncreditor charged off $9,677 in 2016, which is the balance reflected on an April 2020 \ncredit report. Applicant instituted a $200 per month payment plan in 2016. He made \nconsistent payments, and the balance was reduced to $7,677 in January 2021; $5,877 \nin October 2021; and $4,877 in March 2022. (Tr. at 17, 28-29; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 3, 4; AE B, G, T, U) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k(2) allege $5,538 and $2,812 debts owed to the same \nfinancial institution. The April 2020 credit report lists the debts as reported by all three \ncredit reporting agencies with dates of last activity of August 2014 and October 2014. \nThe debts are not listed on the January 2021 Equifax credit report. Applicant asserted \nthat the debts were paid, and provided a payment chart showing $3,735 in payments \nbetween June 2017 and August 2017 on one account, and $1,157 in payments in May \n2018 on another account. These accounts are resolved. (Tr. at 35-36; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE N, O) \nApplicant paid $1,963 in January 2021 to resolve the debt owed to an online \nuniversity (SOR \u00b6 1.p). He paid $162 in January 2022 to pay in full a medical debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.n). (Tr. at 37-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE F, J) \nApplicant owed about $292,000 on his mortgage loan when he lost his home to \nforeclosure in about 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). The creditor sold the property and received a \nclaim from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), but there remained a \ndeficiency balance of about $72,000. The creditor wrote off the deficiency balance and \nheld Applicant and the VA harmless for the deficiency balance. (Tr. at 19-20, 33; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE A) \nApplicant asserted that he paid the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($716) \nand 1.f ($110), the charged-off $533 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and the $152 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. The $152 debt is reported by all three credit reporting agencies \non the April 2020 combined credit report, with an activity date of November 2017. It is \nnot listed on the January 2021 Equifax credit report. The other three debts are listed on \nthat report, which was obtained about five months before the SOR was issued.

(Tr. at 25, 31, 34-36, 43-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n3, 4; AE B) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts, \na foreclosed house, a repossessed car, and unfiled federal and state income tax \nreturns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) are applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant retired after 22 years in the Navy, which included nine years of sea \nservice and almost four years of foreign service. Things went well until about 2014 when \nhe lost a job and then went through periods of unemployment and underemployment. \nThen his health failed him. He was treated for prostate cancer, and he had multiple \nsurgeries on his legs, with the latest surgery in October 2021. Both legs were eventually \namputated, one above the knee and one below. \nApplicant started repaying his debts in 2016, with the balance of one debt \nreduced from $9,677 in 2016 to $4,877 in March 2022. He paid almost $4,900 in 2017 \nand 2018 to resolve two more debts. He documented payments of $1,963 and $162 in \n2021 and 2022 to pay two more debts. His assertions that he paid three debts totaling \nabout $1,300 are given greater weight because the debts are not reported on the most \nrecent credit report and his other assertions that he paid debts were corroborated by \ndocumentation.

He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made \na good-faith effort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast doubt on his current \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \n22 years of honorable service, which included nine years of sea service and almost four \nyears of foreign service, and that he has a 100% disability rating from the VA. I also \nnote that the unfiled tax returns mostly corresponded with the years that Applicant was \ngoing through the surgeries that led to the amputation of his legs. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are \nnot mitigated. Clearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 8, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. The DCSA CAF explained in the SOR why it was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for her. The \nDCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \n(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, applicable to all adjudications for national security \neligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \nOn July 7, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing \nbefore a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On \nNovember 17, 2021, the Government indicated it was ready to proceed to a hearing. On \nFebruary 2, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case assignment and file on February 11, 2022. After some \ncoordination of schedules with the parties, on May 12, 2022, I scheduled an in-person \nhearing for June 6, 2022. \nAt the hearing, two Government exhibits (GE 1-2) were admitted into evidence \nwithout any objections, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on June 23, 2022. \nI held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for Applicant to submit \ndocuments about her work performance and other matters. No documents were received \nby the June 20, 2022 deadline. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant purchased and used marijuana\nwith varying frequency from approximately June 2012 through at least April 2021 (SOR \u00b6\n1.a) and that on her February 7, 2020 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (SF 86), during her March 20, 2020 personnel subject interview (PSI), and in\nher May 13, 2021 response to interrogatories, she expressed her intention to continue\nusing marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Additionally, under Guideline H, Applicant allegedly used \nAdderall without a prescription from about September 2012 through at least June 2019\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c), and cocaine with varying frequency from about March 2017 through at least \nMarch 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and she expressed during her March 2020 PSI her intention to \nuse cocaine in the future (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a detailed response to the SOR in which she admitted the use \nand purchases of marijuana, explaining that all of her purchases were made legally, and \nthat she plans to continue \u201coccasional recreational marijuana use.\u201d She also admitted that \nshe used Adderall without a prescription while she was a full-time engineering student; that \nshe used cocaine infrequently for recreational purposes in the past; and that she had \nstated during her March 2020 PSI that she intended to use cocaine in the future. However, \nshe explained that her life has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic and that she no \nlonger plans to use cocaine in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the drug use and purchases and to intending to continue \nusing marijuana are accepted and incorporated in my factual findings.

(GE 1; Tr. 21.) She began pursuing a master\u2019s degree in January 2022 and \nmaintains a grade point average of 3.85 on a 4.00 scale. (Tr. 15, 30.) She has never \nmarried and has no children. (GE 1.) \nApplicant worked for her current employer, a defense contractor, as a co-op student \nfor two semesters, from January 2017 to August 2017 and from January 2018 to August \n2018, before becoming a full-time employee in July 2019. (GE 1.) Applicant seeks her first \nDOD security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 21.) On February 7, 2020, she completed and certified \nas accurate an SF 86 on which she disclosed a history of marijuana, Adderall, and cocaine \nuse and marijuana purchases. (GE 1.) The salient details follow. \nMarijuana \nApplicant began using marijuana around June 2012 during the summer following her \nsophomore year of high school. She used marijuana once or twice a month with a friend, \nwho provided the marijuana that they smoked together in the friend\u2019s basement or \nbackyard. After high school, Applicant attended a private college in her home state, which \nhad not legalized marijuana use. Applicant used marijuana on a limited basis, about once \nor twice a month recreationally with three college friends, during her freshman and \nsophomore years of college. (Tr. 33.) In 2017, Applicant began to use marijuana illegally \nonce or twice a week (GE 2), although she abstained from marijuana during the two co-op \ninternships with her current employer. (Tr. 33.) She did not purchase marijuana in college. \nShe obtained the drug from one of the friends and paid for dinner for him in exchange for \nthe marijuana. (Tr. 23.) \nAfter college, Applicant moved for her job to her current locale. She passed a pre\u00ad\nemployment drug screen for her employer when she became a full-time employee. (Tr. 34.) \nSince then, she has used marijuana in her residence while socializing with her sister \nor with two friends, and also to relax before bed. She used marijuana on average twice a \nweek, although after she began graduate studies in January 2022, her involvement with \nmarijuana declined to \u201ca little less than once a week.\u201d She used marijuana \u201coften as a \nreplacement for alcohol,\u201d as she experiences worse side effects from alcohol. (Tr. 32, 35-\n36.) She purchased the marijuana she used from licensed cannabis dispensaries in an \nadjacent state. (GEs 1-2.) She testified that she would not be using marijuana currently if it \nwas illegal to purchase it. (Tr. 23.) \nOn her February 2020 SF 86, Applicant estimated that she used marijuana to \nJanuary 2020 \u201cmost likely\u201d more than 50 times. She answered \u201cYes\u201d with respect to \nwhether she intended to use marijuana in the future, and added, \u201cRecreational use may \ncontinue in social circumstances.\u201d Applicant also disclosed on her SF 86 that she \npurchased marijuana illegally one to two times a year between September 2017 and June \n2019, when she was \u201ctoo far away from a state [in] which this was legal.\u201d She denied any \nintention to purchase marijuana illegally in the future.

During her PSI, Applicant \nadmitted that she had continued to use marijuana to as recently as the weekend preceding \nher interview. She expressed an intention to continue to use marijuana and related that she \nhad made no attempts to stop or reduce her drug use. (GE 2.) \nOn May 13, 2021, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories about her drug use. \nShe reported that she had used marijuana over 100 times; that she had purchased the \ndrug; and that she intends to continue to use the drug. She explained that she had \npurchased marijuana legally from dispensaries and then transported it to her home and \nthat she currently had marijuana obtained from a dispensary as well as marijuana \nparaphernalia in her home. (GE 2.) \nOn July 7, 2021, in response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that she had used \nmarijuana, but she also stated that she had not performed any work-related tasks while \nunder the influence of the drug. She added that \u201call marijuana purchases were legal \nthrough the state where purchased.\u201d She expressed an intention to continue occasional \nrecreational marijuana use, and she was currently using the drug as a sleep aid. She did \nnot consider her marijuana use to be detrimental to her life, work performance, or her \nability to complete tasks that would be required of her if she is granted security clearance \neligibility. She explained that marijuana has been legalized in the state where she resides \nand works, and that she would continue to use the drug responsibly. She stated that, if \nnecessary, she could stop using marijuana \u201cas [she had] done in the past.\u201d \nAt her hearing, Applicant admitted that she continued to use marijuana to as \nrecently as late May 2022, about seven days before her hearing (Tr. 17-18), and that she \nintends to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 30.) She purchased the drug herself and used it \nalone in her residence. (Tr. 17-18.) Her rationale is that marijuana is legal in her state, and \nshe has always purchased it legally from dispensaries in an adjacent state. (Tr. 15.) \nApplicant is subject to random drug tests at work. (Tr. 34.) She had not used \nmarijuana while working, and her marijuana use has not led to any involvement with law \nenforcement. While she knows that marijuana is an illegal drug under federal law (Tr. 16, \n18), and she has realized since her March 2020 PSI that using marijuana is incompatible \nwith holding a security clearance (Tr. 19), she does not believe that her character or \ntrustworthiness should be judged based on \u201ca measure that has been deemed appropriate \nby many lawmakers.\u201d (Tr. 16, 20.) While Applicant is still friendly with the persons with \nwhom she used marijuana recreationally in the past, she does not live near them and has \nhad limited contact with them since the COVID pandemic started in 2020. (Tr. 25-27.) \nApplicant\u2019s sister has been around Applicant when Applicant has used marijuana, but she \ndoes not use marijuana herself. (Tr. 33.) \nAdderall \nApplicant used Adderall without a prescription as a study aid from approximately \nSeptember 2012 to 2015 one to five times a year and from 2015 through May 2019 once a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nweek. In high school, she obtained the drug from her sister. In college, she obtained the \ndrug from the same friend who gave her marijuana, and she bought him coffee or dinner in \nexchange for the Adderall. (GE 2; Tr. 28-29.) Applicant estimates that she used Adderall \nmore than 50 times total during high school and college. (GEs 1-2.) On her SF 86, during \nher PSI, in response to DOHA interrogatories, in response to the SOR, and at her hearing, \nApplicant denied any intention to use Adderall in the future. (GEs 1-2; Answer; Tr. 14.) She \nunderstands that she should not have used Adderall without a prescription to help her \nstudy. (Answer.) \nCocaine \nApplicant used cocaine with her sister five times a year between March 2017 and \nMarch 2020. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 27.) She used cocaine before going out to bars when visiting \nher sister. She also used it in her residence when her sister visited her. Applicant did not \npurchase any of the cocaine that she used. (GE 2.) \nOn her February 2020 SF 86, Applicant denied any intention to use cocaine in the \nfuture, and stated, \u201cNo longer intend to use this drug, no longer going out in that way.\u201d (GE \n1.) During her PSI, Applicant admitted that she had used cocaine during the previous \nweekend to stay awake and be more energetic. She stated that she had no plan to use \ncocaine in the future, but that she would use it if circumstances conducive to cocaine use \narose. (GE 2.) When she responded to DOHA interrogatories in May 2021, Applicant \ndenied any intention to use cocaine in the future. (GE 2.) In her July 2021 Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant explained her changed intention about future use of cocaine, as follows: \nSince the COVID-19 pandemic my life has changed drastically, and I do not \nhave plans to use this substance in the future. Additionally, I do not have any \nof this substance in my capacity or available to me. Lastly, I have not, and \nwould never be under the influence while working, or performing any \nnecessary tasks. (Answer.) \nApplicant explained at her hearing that the pandemic impacted her lifestyle, \nincluding her activities and social associations. She had seen the friends listed on her SF \n86 only one or two times since the COVID-related lockdown in March 2020. While she \ninteracts with her sister regularly, to Applicant\u2019s knowledge, her sister has not purchased \nany illegal drugs in the last two years. (Tr. 15.) \nApplicant takes her job responsibilities seriously. Her performance reviews have \nbeen positive. She indicated that she would not waiver in her commitment to her work if \ngranted clearance eligibility. (Tr. 16.) However, she is not required to hold a clearance to \nkeep her present job.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that, effective July 1, 2021, the possession \nand use of up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana became legal in the state where Applicant lives \nand works. Retail sales of marijuana are not yet legal in her state. On December 15, 2016, \nthe state where Applicant has purchased marijuana since mid-2019 legalized the use, \npurchase, possession or manufacture of one ounce or less of marijuana by adults age 21 \nyears or older. However, possession of cocaine and of Adderall without a prescription \nremains illegal in both states. \nMoreover, marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law \npursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs are those \nwhich have a high potential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical use in treatment \nin the United States; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under medical \nsupervision. Cocaine and Adderall, as Schedule II drugs, have an accepted medical use, \nbut they have a high potential for abuse and may lead to severe psychological or physical \ndependence. It is illegal to possess cocaine or Adderall when it is not medically authorized. \nSection 844 under Title 21 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to \nknowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid \nprescription. \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security eligibility determinations. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, the current DNI issued clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana, noting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may \nbe relevant to security adjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person \nevaluation. Relevant factors in mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur. The DNI also made clear \nthat products that contain more than 0.3 percent of THC remain illegal to use under federal \nlaw and policy. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from approximately June 2012 to at least late May 2022. \nShe continued to use the drug on a weekly basis after going to work full time for a defense \ncontractor, despite knowing that marijuana possession remains illegal under federal law \nand that her marijuana involvement could result in unfavorable adjudication of her security \nclearance eligibility. Additionally, she used Adderall without a prescription more than 50 \ntimes as a study aid in high school and college, and cocaine while socializing with her \nsister on fewer than 20 occasions between March 2017 and March 2020. Disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d applies. \nAG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia,\u201d also applies. Applicant\u2019s possession of marijuana has been illegal under \nfederal law during the entirety of her involvement over the past decade. She reported on \nher SF 86 that she purchased marijuana illegally once or twice a year before relocating to \nher current locale when she began purchasing marijuana legally from licensed \ndispensaries in a state nearby. The state in which she has resided since July 2019 \nlegalized marijuana use and possession only a year ago. She did not directly purchase \nAdderall or cocaine, but in exchange for Adderall, she paid for some of her friend\u2019s meals. \nAG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse,\u201d is established \nbecause Applicant intends to continue to use marijuana. AG \u00b6 25(g) no longer applies with \nrespect to cocaine. She had no plan to use cocaine again as of her March 2020 PSI, but \nshe also stated at that time that she would use cocaine if the circumstances warranted. \nHowever, in her July 2021 response to DOHA interrogatories, she denied any intention to \nuse cocaine in the future. She has since reiterated in her Answer to the SOR and at her \nhearing that she does not intend to use any cocaine in the future. Her candid disclosures of \nher illegal drug involvement, including her admission to intending to continue using \nmarijuana, lead me to accept as credible her denial of any intention to use cocaine in the \nfuture. \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply of her \nillegal drug activity. AG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) cannot reasonably apply, given the recency and frequency of Applicant\u2019s \ndrug involvement. Her marijuana use has been regular and is ongoing. While she last used \nAdderall around May 2019, she used the drug without a prescription more than 50 times. \nShe used cocaine fewer than 20 times, but most recently in March 2020 after she \ncompleted her SF 86. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies to her Adderall use, which she has not used since college. She \nbegan pursuing her master\u2019s degree in January 2022, and so is currently in an academic \nenvironment, which raises the risk of recurrence somewhat. However, she testified credibly \nthat she understands it was wrong of her to have used Adderall without a prescription, and \nshe has repeatedly denied any intention to use it in the future. Regarding Applicant\u2019s \ncocaine use, it is more difficult to find that she has disassociated herself from drug-using \nassociates and contacts because she used the drug with her sister, who provided the drug. \nAs recently as March 2020, Applicant admitted that she would use cocaine in the future if \ncircumstances were conducive to her using cocaine. She asserted in July 2021 that the \nCOVID pandemic had changed her attitude in that she no longer intends to use cocaine in \nthe future. She did not elaborate in that regard, although bar closures and the social \nisolation of the pandemic may have left her without the opportunity to use cocaine. Her \nsister is apparently no longer involved with cocaine, which significantly minimizes the risk of \nApplicant using cocaine in the future. Applicant has persuaded me that she is not likely to \njeopardize her job with a defense contractor by using cocaine again. AG \u00b6 26(b) also \napplies to her cocaine use. \nApplicant has not established any significant abstinence from marijuana use. \nAppendix B of the AGs provides that an individual who is an unlawful user of a controlled \nsubstance or is an addict is statutorily prohibited from holding a security clearance. There \nis no evidence that Applicant is an addict as she has control over her marijuana use, and \nshe has not let her marijuana use adversely affect her work. Yet, given the once to twice \nweekly frequency of her use and her intention to continue using marijuana in the future, the \nstatutory prohibition regarding unlawful users of a controlled substance applies. The \nlegality of her marijuana use under state law does not alter existing federal law prohibiting \nthe possession of marijuana. Applicant asserts that alcohol affects her more adversely than \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes marijuana. Even so, it does not justify her ongoing disregard of federal laws \nconcerning the use and possession of dangerous controlled substances. It is not enough in \nmitigation that she will avoid using marijuana in any work capacity or before reporting for \nwork. None of the mitigating conditions are established with regard to her marijuana use \nand purchase. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe Government must be assured that those persons granted access to classified \ninformation can be counted on to fulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, \nregulations, and policies, including federal drug laws and security clearance requirements. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use was not confined to high school and college. She continued to use \ncocaine and marijuana after becoming a full-time defense-contractor employee and is \nunwilling to cease using and possessing marijuana, despite knowing of the DOD\u2019s \nconcerns and the federal prohibition. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding \nan applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant \nor renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. \n1990). For the reasons previously discussed, I am unable to find at this time that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 41 years old. He is a high school graduate. He married in 2006 and separated from his wife in 2018. They share one child. He has cohabited with his girlfriend since August 2019. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since 2002. (Item 3) Applicant disclosed in his January 2020 security clearance application (SCA) that he failed to file his 2018 federal and state income tax returns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). He said he was in the middle of his separation from his wife, and he was having difficulty making his mortgage payment and forgot to file his tax returns. He said he was going to file his 2018 tax returns after he completed his 2019 tax returns. (Item 3) In May 2020, a government investigator interviewed Applicant. He explained he began having financial problems in 2010 when his wife\u2019s work hours were reduced, and she was only working on a part-time basis. They were unable to pay all their bills on his salary and her reduced salary. They had difficulty making their mortgage payments. Despite efforts to save their house, it went into foreclosure in late 2018 or early 2019. Applicant said the total amount that was delinquent when it foreclosed was $65,000.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 8 (Item 1 is the SOR.) Applicant provided a \nresponse to the FORM that is marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There were no \nobjections to any of the documents offered and all were admitted into evidence. The case \nwas assigned to me on September 15, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is a high school graduate. He married in 2006 and \nseparated from his wife in 2018. They share one child. He has cohabited with his girlfriend \nsince August 2019. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since \n2002. (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed in his January 2020 security clearance application (SCA) that \nhe failed to file his 2018 federal and state income tax returns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). He \nsaid he was in the middle of his separation from his wife, and he was having difficulty \nmaking his mortgage payment and forgot to file his tax returns. He said he was going to \nfile his 2018 tax returns after he completed his 2019 tax returns. (Item 3) \nIn May 2020, a government investigator interviewed Applicant. He explained he \nbegan having financial problems in 2010 when his wife\u2019s work hours were reduced, and \nshe was only working on a part-time basis. They were unable to pay all their bills on his \nsalary and her reduced salary. They had difficulty making their mortgage payments. \nDespite efforts to save their house, it went into foreclosure in late 2018 or early 2019. \nApplicant said the total amount that was delinquent when it foreclosed was $65,000. He \ntold the investigator he did not know if he owed any money. Applicant\u2019s December 2019 \ncredit report shows the mortgage in a foreclosure status with a past-due amount of \n$89,675. His March 2020 credit report shows the account in collection and in foreclosure \nwith a balance of $283,815 and his October 2021 credit report shows the mortgage is in \nthe foreclosure process and his past-due amount is $89,675. The debt is alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.g ($89,675). Applicant did not provide any information regarding the status or \nresolution of this debt. (Items 4, 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant told the investigator that he spoke with the IRS about filing his delinquent \n2018 tax returns and he was told that he had to first file his 2019 tax returns. He said he \nwould file his 2019 returns and then file his 2018 tax returns. He intended to do the same \nfor his state tax returns for those tax years. Due to the COVID pandemic the tax return \ndue date for tax year 2019 was extended to July 2020. (Item 4) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in August 2021. He reported that \nhe had filed his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns. For tax year 2019, \nhe owed federal income taxes of approximately $5,351, and $13,307 for tax year 2020 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). He reported he owed his state $116 for tax year 2019 and $1,542 for tax \nyear 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He reported he had not filed his 2018 federal and state income \ntax returns because he was in the middle of a move. (Item 4) Applicant\u2019s response to the \nFORM stated: \nI have filed my taxes and made a payment plan and as for my other debt \nI\u2019m with [XYZ] to get me back on track. This company has been good to me \nyes a few years has put me in a bad spot right now but I\u2019m working that and \nI\u2019m doing everything to correct that. (AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged Applicant was indebted to the federal government for delinquent \ntaxes for tax year 2016 that remained unpaid until 2020. Applicant admitted the allegation \nand provided documentary evidence that he made a payment of $654 to the IRS for tax \nyear 2016 in May 2020. (Items 2, 4) \nApplicant did not provide any corroborating evidence that he filed his 2018 federal \nor state income tax returns or that he has a payment plan with the IRS or his state tax \nauthority and paid his delinquent tax debt. \nThe SOR alleged two small debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($429) and 1.h ($171). Applicant did not \nprovide supporting documents that these debts are resolved. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant failed to file his 2018 federal and state income tax returns. He is indebted \nto the federal government for delinquent taxes for tax years, 2019 and 2020 in the \napproximate amount of $18,658. He is indebted to his state tax authority in the \napproximate amount of $1,658. His mortgage foreclosed and there was a past-due \nbalance owed of $89,675. Applicant had two other delinquent debts in collection that are \nunresolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant failed to file his 2018 federal and state income tax returns. Despite being \non notice that this is a security concern, he failed to provide proof that the returns have \nbeen filed. Applicant paid his 2016 federal income taxes in 2020. He did not provide proof \nthat he has a payment arrangement with the IRS or that he has made any payments \ntoward his 2019 and 2020 federal or state tax debts. He has not provided evidence as to \nthe current status or obligation for the deficiency balance on his foreclosed mortgage or \nthat he has contacted the creditors for the other two debts alleged in the SOR or resolved \nthem. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent, ongoing, and numerous. Based on his past history of \nfailing to pay his debts, I am unable to find that future financial issues are unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant indicated that his financial problems began in 2010 when his wife\u2019s \nincome was reduced and they later divorced. These were conditions beyond his control. \nFor the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must show he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He has failed to do so. It has been years since his wife\u2019s income was \nreduced. He did not provide evidence that he has contacted creditors or attempted to \nresolve the debts alleged. He has not provided evidence that he has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve his debts. He eventually paid his 2016 tax debt in 2020. AG \u00b6 20(b) has \nminimal application. \nApplicant stated that he intended to file his delinquent 2018 federal and state tax \nreturns. He did not provide evidence that the returns are filed despite being on notice \nabout the issue. He explained the reason he failed to file the returns was because he was \nmoving. In his response to the FORM, he said he had filed his delinquent tax returns and \nhad a payment plan, but provided no documentary evidence to support his statement. AG \n\u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nApplicant indicated in his response to the FORM that he was working with a \nfinancial group to help him get back on track. He did not provide any further explanation \nas to what tangible efforts he has made to pay his delinquent creditors. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies \nto the extent that this financial group may have provided him some financial counseling, \nbut there is insufficient evidence that his financial problems are resolved or under control. \nThere is evidence that Applicant paid his delinquent 2016 federal income taxes in \n2020. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the extent that the taxes are paid, but the fact it took three \nyears for him to pay them negates that this was a good-faith effort. AG \u00b6 20(d) has minimal \napplication. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nApplicant has provided scant evidence that he is resolving his taxes and other \ndebts. He has failed to provide sufficient evidence that he filed his 2018 federal and state \ntax returns. Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comment, all of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a senior associate in configuration management with her current employer since November 2020. She previously served as a configuration management specialist with another employer from January 2011 until October 2020.

On June 24, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Executive Order (Exec.

(Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on August 24, 2021, and she was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on August 31, 2021. Her response was due on September 30, 2021. She \ntimely submitted several documents to support her contentions that she contacted her \ncreditors, and that she had made payments to them. In the absence of objections by the \nGovernment, those documents have been marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through \nAE K, and accepted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on December 14, 2021. \nThe record closed on September 30, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comment, all of the SOR \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings \nof fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a senior associate in configuration management with her current employer since \nNovember 2020. She previously served as a configuration management specialist with \nanother employer from January 2011 until October 2020. A 1997 high school graduate, \nshe received an associate\u2019s degree in 2009 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. She has \nnever served in the U.S. military. She has never been granted a security clearance. She \nwas married in 2002 and divorced in 2009. She has no children. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86, dated November 6, 2020); Item 4 \n(Enhanced Subject Interview, dated January 12, 2021); Item 5 (Combined Experian, \nTransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated December 1, 2020); and Item 6 (Equifax \nCredit Report, dated June 1, 2021). \nWhile Applicant was dating her husband who was about 15 years older than she \nwas, he was paying his mortgage, automobile loan, and dating expenses by using his \ncredit cards. Although they were married in 2002, it was not until 2003 that they combined \ntheir bank accounts. She was shocked at the amount of debt he had accumulated, and \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas an administrative assistant only earning $15 per hour, she could not see a way to \nresolve the financial issues. The resolution was a joint bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the \nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. She did so in January 2004, and the bankruptcy was discharged \nin April 2004. (Response to the FORM, at 4; Item 8) \nWhile there was some marital debt when she was divorced in 2009, the next \nsignificant financial impact on her took place during the final phase of the recession \nremaining in 2010 when she lost her job. Although she was denied unemployment \ncompensation for unspecified reasons, she survived on food stamps for about six months \nbefore she eventually obtained another job. During that period, she was evicted from her \nresidence and her vehicle was repossessed. She sought the advice of her former \nbankruptcy attorney, and this time, he recommended that she file for bankruptcy under \nChapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. She did so in October 2011, and the bankruptcy \nwas discharged in October 2016. (Response to the FORM, at 4; Item 9) \nThe third and most recent phase of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose in 2019 \nwhen she and her boyfriend decided to reside together. She qualified for a home loan \nand, in April 2019, purchased a residence in the school district where her boyfriend\u2019s \ndaughter attended school. She exceeded her anticipated budget because of the low \ninventory of houses available. She soon learned that there were high energy costs but \nwith two sources of income, they were sufficient to make the payments. Unfortunately, \nthings did not go as anticipated, for they eventually broke up because of his infidelity. To \nmake things worse, she found out that her ex-boyfriend had stopped making the \nautomobile loan payments for which she had co-signed and the insurance payments. With \nrising costs, increased property taxes and insurance escrow payments, she prioritized \nher debts and chose to save her house over paying her credit-card accounts. She was \nable to sell the residence in May 2021, and has focused on resolving all her delinquent \ndebt. She now has only two credit cards and has greatly reduced her expenses. She is \nintent on avoiding such situations in the future like those that led to her financial \ndifficulties. (Response to the FORM, at 2; AE K) \nIn addition to her two bankruptcies, the SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts \ntotaling approximately $18,899, as set forth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,571 that was \nplaced for collection and charged off. (Item 3, at 42; Item 4, at 3; Item 5, at 6; Item 6, at \n3) Shortly after she sold her house, in May 2021 and before the SOR was issued, \nApplicant made the full $1,571 payment. (Response to the FORM, at 2; AE A; Item 2, at \n1) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $3,772 that was \nplaced for collection, charged off, and sold to a debt purchaser.

(Response to the FORM, at 3; AE G; Item 2, at 1-2) The \naccount has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,684 that was \nplaced for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.

(Response to the FORM, at 3; AE H; Item 2, at \n2) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. is a 2002 co-signed home refinance account on the residence that was \nsolely owned by Applicant\u2019s husband before their marriage, and in which he continued to \nreside after their divorce in 2009.  In April 2012, a notice of default was filed along with a \nnotice of trustee sale. The notice was served solely on Applicant\u2019s ex-husband at the \naddress of the residence. Although it was supposed to have been served on Applicant, \nshe had not resided at that residence in three years since the divorce. Applicant initially \ndenied any responsibility for the loan or the anticipated trustee sale.

Applicant\u2019s ex-husband managed to save the \nhouse from foreclosure, and he still resides in it. Furthermore, a foreclosure action was \nnever reported on Applicant\u2019s credit reports, and no such action ever appeared during her \nsubsequent financing and purchase of her home in 2019. (Response to the FORM, at 4-\n5; AE I; Item 2, at 2) The alleged status of the account has been effectively refuted. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i. and 1.j. are the Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged on April 28, \n2004 (Item 8) and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was discharged on October 31, 2016. \n(Item 9). With respect to the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, Applicant received approved credit \ncounseling as part of the process. She listed two creditors holding $15,300 in secured \nclaims (including one for a vehicle that she had co-signed for her ex-husband and which \nhe possessed), and creditors holding $33,070 in unsecured claims. She reported $2,967 \nin an average monthly income, and $2,357 in average monthly expenses. She had $7,018 \nin student loans. While there is no trustee\u2019s report and repayment plan in the case file, as \nnoted above, the bankruptcy was discharged on October 31, 2016, indicating that the \npayment plan had been successfully completed.

Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIn addition to her two bankruptcies, the SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts \ntotaling approximately $18,899. Applicant claimed that she had insufficient funds to \nmaintain those accounts in a current status. In her Answer to the SOR, she admitted the \ntwo bankruptcies, but denied that as of the date the SOR was issued (June 24, 2021), the \naccounts were still delinquent. Subsequent submissions of documents by her confirm that \nbefore the FORM was issued, all of her formerly delinquent accounts had been resolved. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) and have been established. With regard to being unwilling to satisfy \nher debts regardless of an ability to do so, the evidence leads to a conclusion that AG \u00b6 \n19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) fully or partially apply. It appears that Applicant \nwas too trusting in choosing her relationships and in co-signing financial obligations for \nher husband and subsequent boyfriend, for they left her with debts following their \nbreakups. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy wiped out her debts in April 2004 \u2013 nearly 18 years \nago. The lengthy period of unemployment towards the end of the recession in 2010 \ncreated unanticipated financial difficulties. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy enabled her to \nresolve those lingering debts as well as the debts associated with her broken relationship \nwith her boyfriend. She managed to resolve those debts after five years of working with \nthe bankruptcy trustee. Up until a month before the SOR was issued, Applicant had \ndelinquent debts. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered \nrecent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant prioritized her delinquent \naccounts in order to preserve her residence. Finally, when she sold that residence in May \n2021, within a matter of days, she settled or paid off most of her delinquent debts. She \nno longer has any delinquent debts, and she has resolved to never find herself in a similar \nfinancial situation. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nHowever, in this instance, Applicant nearly resolved all of her delinquent debts a month \nbefore the SOR was issued, within days of selling her residence. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant successfully refuted \none of the allegations and resolved all of the remaining accounts alleged in the SOR.  \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nApplicant\u2019s actions in prioritizing her debts in order to preserve her interest in her \nresidence until it could be sold before addressing her consumer debts under the \ncircumstances no longer cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nHer history of financial difficulties and delinquent debt is documented in the casefile: a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy discharged her debts in April 2004; a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nenabled her to pay her debts until they were discharged in October 2016; and she \nsubsequently accumulated nine additional delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$18,899. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been \nserving as a senior associate in configuration management with her current employer \nsince November 2020, and she was already recognized for her outstanding performance. \nShe previously served as a configuration management specialist with another employer \nfrom January 2011 until October 2020. A 1997 high school graduate, she received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2009 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant found herself in two difficult romantic relationships, she \naddressed the resultant financial issues as best she could with guidance from legal \ncounsel. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy wiped out the family \u2013 mostly her husband\u2019s \u2013 debts \nnearly 18 years ago. Her unemployment towards the end of the recession in 2010 was \nunanticipated, and she managed to eventually resolve her debts from that period. The \nunexpected turn of events with her boyfriend resulted in additional debts that she could \nnot carry alone. However, in choosing to adopt the Chapter 13 bankruptcy route, she \ndedicated herself to making payments to creditors under the bankruptcy trustee \nrepayment plan. She successfully did so until the bankruptcy was discharged in October \n2016. The debts alleged in the SOR was largely resolved before the SOR was issued, \nand by the time the FORM was issued, all of her delinquent debts have been resolved. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is positive and encouraging because it \ncommenced before the SOR was issued. Overall, the evidence leaves me without \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from her financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) \nthrough AG 2(d) (9). \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

The FORM was mailed \nto Applicant on the same day. Applicant was given 30 days to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. Applicant received \nthe FORM on February 19, 2022. He responded to the FORM on March 8, 2022, and \nsubmitted a brief (Response Brief) and two documents that are marked as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A and B. Items 1 through 11 and AE A and B are admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on April 27, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 61 years old, has never married, and has an adult daughter. He is a \nhigh school graduate and has completed some college-level courses. Applicant\u2019s sponsor \nis a defense contractor whose employment offer is pending a favorable security clearance \ndetermination for Applicant. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance. \n(Item 4.) At the time of his Personal Subject Interview (PSI) on July 29, 2020, Applicant \nwas unemployed. He also had periods of unemployment in March 2018 (one month), July \nto August 2018 (two months), and December 2015 to February 2016 (three months). \n(Item 4.) \nApplicant submitted a character reference email dated November 9, 2021. The \nauthor is from Another Government Agency (AGA) to the recipient from AGA and copied \nto Applicant. The subject is \u201cOutstanding IT Support & Customer Service.\u201d The author \nexpressed her \u201cabsolute gratitude\u201d for Applicant\u2019s support that day \u201cand every time he is \nassigned\u201d to a project. The author described Applicant\u2019s support as \u201cimmediate\u201d and \nmade \u201cthe process easy, well-understood, and fast.\u201d The author described Applicant as \n\u201ctop-notch.\u201d (Item 3 at 38.) \nNote: The recitation of Guideline F tax allegations below reflects the \nGovernment\u2019s amendments to the original SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., g., and h. The amendments \nare shown in bold. Brackets indicate the deletions. That recitation also reflects the \nGovernment\u2019s withdrawal of SOR \u00b6 1.e.  Applicant did not object to the \namendments or to the withdrawal. (Response Brief.) \nUnder Guideline F regarding taxes, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) failed \ntimely to file his federal and state income tax returns, as required, for tax years (TY) 2015, \n2016, and 2019; (2) is indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes of [$3,896] \n$492.52 for tax year(TY) 2013; (3) is indebted to the federal government for delinquent \ntaxes of $1,498 for (TY) 2015; (4) is indebted to the state for delinquent taxes of $727 for \nTY 2013; (5) is indebted to the state [federal government] for delinquent taxes of $1,491 \nfor TY 2015; and (7) is indebted to the state [federal government] for delinquent taxes \nof $548 for TY 2018 and 2019.

He cited \u201ca lapse of judgment,\u201d \n\u201cmismanagement,\u201d and \u201cvarious reasons\u201d for his financial difficulties. (Response Brief at \n2-3.) \nUnder Guideline F regarding consumer debt, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) \nis indebted to a creditor for an account placed in collections for $5,356; (2) is indebted to \na creditor for an account that has been charged off for $2,674; and (3) is indebted to a \ncreditor for an account that has been charged off for $3,085. (Item 1.) Applicant denied \nthe three consumer debt allegations, referring to \u201csupporting documentation.\u201d (Item 3.) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant (1) was arrested in August 2020 \nfor domestic violence offenses and charged with infliction of corporal injury to a spouse \nor cohabitant and battery with serious bodily injury; and (2) was arrested in April 1993 for \na domestic violence offense and charged with injury to a spouse or cohabitant. (Item 1.) \nApplicant admitted the first allegation (the arrest) but denied that he was charged, as \nalleged. Applicant denied the second allegation. (Item 3.) \nGuideline F Tax Allegations \nEach individual SOR tax allegation will be considered in light of Applicant\u2019s Answer \n(and supporting documents therein), Department Counsel\u2019s FORM brief (and documents \ntherein), Applicant\u2019s Response Brief, and AE A and AE B. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. Failure to file federal and state income tax returns for \ntax years (TY) 2015, 2016, and 2019. Applicant answered that he was on an installment \nagreement with the state. He did not, however, submit any such agreement. The record \nshows and Department Counsel agrees that those returns have been filed but belatedly \nso. I concur. Applicant filed his 2015 and 2016 federal and state returns in May 2018 and \nhis 2019 federal and state returns in December 2020. (Item 6 at 1-2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Indebted to the IRS for $492 for TY 2013. Applicant arranged with \nan entity in November 2021 to make $200 quarterly payments to the IRS through May \n2024 to address this debt. (The arrangement also included a TY 2017 debt that is not at \nissue here.) Department Counsel is correct that there is no record of payments made \nunder this plan. As I read the record, however, it shows that this debt was paid on March \n7, 2019. (Item 3 at 5-7; Item 6 at 5-7.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. Indebted to the IRS for $1,498 for TY 2015. Applicant answered that \nhe was on an installment agreement with the state. He did not, however, submit any such \nagreement. AE A is an IRS document that is undated but shows a zero balance due from \nApplicant for tax year 2015. The document was likely generated before the end of tax \nyear 2021, because there is no amount owed or to be refunded for that tax year. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e.

Applicant submitted his bank statements showing six payments of $60 per \nmonth to the state Franchise Tax Board from June 2021 to November 2021. Those \nstatements do not indicate to which tax year those payments were directed. If they were \ndirected to tax year 2013, there is no documentation that $360 satisfied the debt of $727. \n(Item 3 at 2, 9-14.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. Indebted to the state for $1,491 for TY 2015. Applicant answered \nthat he was on an installment agreement with the state. He did not, however, submit any \nsuch agreement. Applicant did not submit his state return for TY 2015. He did submit \nbank statements showing two payments of $60 to the state Franchise Tax Board on July \n23, 2021, and August 23, 2021. Those statements do not indicate to which tax year those \npayments were directed. (Item 3 at 2; Item 6 at 29-34.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. Indebted to the state for $548 for TY 2018 and 2019. Applicant \nanswered that he was on an installment agreement with the state. He did not, however, \nsubmit any such agreement, nor did any of his documents address that allegation. (Item \n3.) \nAE B is a one-page bank statement that shows a single payment of $200 to the \n\u201cU.S. Treasury\u201d on \u201cFebruary 10.\u201d That entry does not include the year of the payment, \nnor does the document itself bear a date. Applicant cites AE B as evidence showing \n\u201cautomatic withdrawals to confirm this payment arrangement.\u201d (Response Brief at 9.) \nNeither Applicant\u2019s Answer nor his Response Brief, however, tied that payment to a \nparticular payment arrangement, a tax year, or a Guideline F tax allegation.   \nGuideline F Consumer Debt Allegations \nEach of the three individual SOR consumer debt allegation will be considered in \nlight of Applicant\u2019s Answer (and supporting documents therein), Department Counsel\u2019s \nFORM brief (and supporting documents therein), Applicant\u2019s Response Brief, and AE A \nand AE B. Applicant denied each of those allegations. The three consumer debt \nallegations are supported by the July 16, 2020 credit report. (Item 7.) In his July 29, 2020 \nPSI, Applicant explained that in light of the pending offer from his sponsor, he pulled his \ncredit report in May 2020. Applicant explained that he would address the three consumer \ndebts in that credit report beginning in June 2020. (Item 5 at 6-8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. Indebted to a creditor for $5,356. This debt is owed to Applicant\u2019s \nformer landlord. Applicant vacated the leasehold at the end of the term. He had paid the \nrent in full. He was never told by the landlord why that amount was due. He speculated \nthat the landlord charged him because Applicant did not participate in an end-of-lease \nwalk-around.

(Item \n3 at 25.) \nGuideline F Allegations Not Alleged in the SOR  \nIn the FORM Brief, Department Counsel makes four allegations not alleged in the \nSOR that she contends are relevant to the history and extent of Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems. (FORM Brief at 9-10.) \nFirst, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case on April 25, 1996, that was \ndischarged on August 14, 1996. (Item 8.) \nSecond, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case on March 19, 2001, that was \ndischarged on January 4, 2002, for failure to make plan payments. (Item 8.) \nThird, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case on February 11, 2002, that \nwas discharged on March 9, 2007, \u201cafter completion of chapter 13 plan.\u201d (Item 8.)  \nFourth, a federal tax lien was filed against Applicant on August 20, 2009, for \n$6,372. (Item 9.) The fate of that lien is unknown. \nApplicant did not respond to these four allegations. (Response Brief.) \nGuideline J Criminal Conduct \nEach of the two SOR criminal conduct allegations will be considered in light of \nApplicant\u2019s Answer (and supporting documents) and Department Counsel\u2019s FORM brief \n(and supporting documents), \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant was arrested in August 2020 for domestic offenses and \ncharged with Infliction of corporal injury to a spouse or cohabitant and battery with serious \nbodily injury. Applicant admitted that he was arrested but denied that he was charged, as \nalleged. (Item 3.) As evidence of the allegation, the Government submitted police reports \ndocumenting the arrest and an emergency room interview of the victim, Applicant\u2019s \ncohabitant. The police also interviewed Applicant at his home. On the evening of the \nincident, Applicant and his cohabitant were in the bedroom of their residence. Applicant \ntold his cohabitant he needed to go to his daughter\u2019s house. Cohabitant did not want him \ndriving due to his alcohol consumption. Applicant became upset and called her a name. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe threw a pillow at Applicant, hitting him in the stomach. In Applicant\u2019s version, he threw \nsomething back, hitting her in the back. Beyond that throwing exchange, Applicant denied \nany physical altercation; there was just a verbal one. Applicant claimed that cohabitant \nhad been drinking excessively. He reported that cohabitant had no physical injuries when \nshe left their home that evening. According to cohabitant, Applicant struck her with his \nclosed fist about ten times, in her face, stomach, back, and arms. She left the house and \nhid in the backyard until he left. At the emergency room, the nurse reported that cohabitant \nhad multiple injuries, including her right arm being fractured in numerous places. \nCohabitant said she wished to press charges. Cohabitant was transferred to another \nhospital to consult with an orthopedic surgeon about her right arm. (Item 10 at 5-7.) \nCohabitant later dropped the charges, and the prosecutor declined to prosecute. (Item 3 \nat 32; Item 5 at 18; Item 10 at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b. Applicant was arrested in April 1993 for a domestic violence \noffense and injury to a spouse or cohabitant. (Item 3 at 36-37.) Applicant did not \naddress the arrest allegation but denied that he was charged, as alleged. (Item 3.) As \nevidence of the allegation, the Government submitted a Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) record documenting the arrest and the charge. In his PSI, Applicant explained that \nhe and his niece had a physical confrontation in his truck on the way back from a trip. He \npulled into a rest stop, and his niece became enraged and began throwing things at \nApplicant. In the process, his niece broke some glass and suffered cuts. Applicant said \nhis niece was intoxicated. A sheriff arrived and took both of them to jail. They stayed two \nnights, because the courts were closed due to a holiday. Applicant said this was \u201can \nisolated incident,\u201d and he broke up with his niece shortly thereafter (Item 5 at 16-17.) The \nFBI document reports that the prosecutor declined to prosecute Applicant. (Item 11.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance. As noted \nby the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether \nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor \nof protecting national security. \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information. An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level. \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The Government has the burden of presenting evidence \nto establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted. An applicant is \nresponsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that \nhave been admitted or proven. In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a \npreponderance of evidence. The Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and \na judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard. \nDiscussion \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information\u2026. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It \nencompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other important \nqualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u204b 19(f):\n \n failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \n. . . or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following mitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a problematic financial \nhistory. Security concerns are raised under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), (c), and (f). The next inquiry \nis whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nTAXES: The crux of the financial case is Applicant\u2019s history of failing timely to file \nstate and federal income tax returns. He filed his 2015 and 2016 federal returns in May \n2018 and his 2019 return in December 2020. Applicant filed his 2015 and 2016 state \nreturns in May 2018 and his 2019 return in December 2020. The 2015 and 2016 returns \nwere egregiously tardy. And the 2019 returns barely made it into calendar year 2020, still \nmonths overdue. \nFailure to file tax returns is itself a separate security concern. ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). Although Applicant is now current on his tax return \nfilings, he demonstrated a careless disregard for his legal obligations under state and \nfederal tax laws. DOHA\u2019s mission is not to collect taxes. Nor is it to prod applicants to \ntimely file their tax returns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, \n2008). The mission is to ensure that applicants show the capacity diligently to comply \nwith laws and regulations governing the handling of classified information. That Applicant \nfinally got around to filing his tax returns is not a sufficient defense, without a justifiable \nreason for the delay. The Appeals Board has regularly rejected the \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \nexcuse for applicants who play catch-up with their untimely tax filings. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant offered \u201ca lapse of judgment,\u201d \u201cmismanagement,\u201d and \u201cvarious reasons\u201d \nfor his tax difficulties. Although he should be commended for his candor, those reasons \nare not justifiable excuses. Those failings do not reflect well on Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant recited that he was on \u201cinstallment agreements\u201d for six of the SOR tax \nallegations. He did not, however, adequately document those agreements. In addition, \nApplicant did not sufficiently document his payments under those plans. The Appeals \nBoard has routinely held that it is reasonable to expect applicants to produce \ndocumentation supporting their efforts to resolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-\n00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). Applicant has not satisfied that basic requirement.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax troubles began as far back as 2013, and they continued from 2014 \nthrough 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019. His tax deficiencies are current and were frequent. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated reliance on installment agreements calls into question his ongoing \nability to pay future tax debts. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s three brief periods of \nunemployment (one, two, and three months). Without more information, however, I am \nunable to conclude that they materially impaired Applicant\u2019s ability to file tax returns or \npay his taxes. I find that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (d), and (g) do not apply. \nTherefore, I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 a. through h. (SOR \u00b6 1.e. was withdrawn.) \nConsumer Debts: Applicant\u2019s three consumer debts remain to be addressed. The \napplicable timeline is relevant here. Applicant completed his SCA on June 17, 2020, in \nwhich he listed three consumer debts. In his July 29, 2020 PSI, he stated that he accessed \nhis credit report in May 2020, in connection with his sponsor\u2019s pending job offer. In that \nPSI, he discussed these debts, saying they would be addressed.  The SOR was issued \non November 15, 2021. By that time, Applicant had settled two of those debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.j. and 1.k.) on October 29, 2021 and November 3, 2021, respectively. And he had \nretained counsel for the other debt on November 15, 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.i.).  \nThe Appeals Board does not look favorably upon applicants who address their \nfinancial issues only once their clearance prospects are in jeopardy. That appears to be \nthe stimulus that prompted Applicant to resolve his consumer debts, which happened just \nbefore the SOR was issued. See ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019); \nISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). Therefore, I find against Applicant \non SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i., j., and k. \nUnalleged Financial Conduct: In the FORM brief, Department Counsel noted four \ncircumstances not in the SOR that bear on the history and extent of Applicant\u2019s financial \nportrait. Applicant did not object or otherwise respond to those allegations. \nThe Appeals Board has held that facts not alleged in the SOR may be considered \nonly for limited purposes. One of those purposes is to provide evidence for the \u201cwhole-\nperson\u201d analysis. ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003), citing AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6) (the \u201cwhole-person\u201d  factors). It is for that purpose that I consider \nthese four allegations. Taken together, these four instances show that Applicant has a \nproblematic financial history that reaches back more than 25 years. That history and \nApplicant\u2019s more recent financial issues documented in the SOR do not promote a \npositive assessment of Applicant\u2019s worthiness to hold a national security clearance.  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nApplicant\u2019s background of alleged criminal conduct raises a security concern, \nwhich is detailed in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31. The following \npotentially applies to both SOR allegations of domestic violence against Applicant, the \none in 1993 and the one in 2020. \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nA potentially applicable mitigating condition is set forth in AG \u00b6 32 as follows: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \nApplicant\u2019s arrest and two-day detention in 1993 for a domestic relations offense \npossibly triggers security concerns under AG \u00b6 31(b). The circumstances were that \nApplicant and his niece became involved in a physical altercation at a highway rest stop. \nThe police arrested both of them and jailed them for two days. Applicant denied that he \nassaulted his niece. He also claimed that his niece was intoxicated. The prosecutor \ndeclined to prosecute. On this record, it appears that Applicant and his niece were in \nequal fault, which is likely why the prosecutor declined to prosecute. Therefore, I do not \nfind that the SOR allegation is based on credible evidence, as required by AG \u00b6 31(b). In \naddition, the incident is 29 years old and occurred under unusual circumstances. AG \u00b6 \n32(a) applies. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nApplicant\u2019s incident in August 2020 involving his cohabitant and domestic violence \ntriggers security concerns under AG \u00b6 31(b). For the folIowing reasons, I find that AG \u00b6 \n31(b) applies and is not mitigated. The circumstances have been amply recited in the \nFindings of Fact above. A fair question is why this incident results in a finding different \nfrom the 1993 incident. There are several material distinctions. First, this incident is only \ntwo years old. It did not occur that long ago. Second, Applicant and his cohabitant were \nboth detained in the earlier incident, unlike here. Third, and most significant, here the \npolice reports of the emergency room interview of cohabitant identify a strong consistency \nbetween her injuries and her recounting of the physical blows she claimed she suffered \nat the hands of Applicant. This presents credible evidence. Finally, unlike the first incident, \nhere cohabitant did press charges, although she later dropped them. Thus, it is fair to \nconclude that the prosecutor declined to prosecute, because he would not have the \ncohabitant as a witness. Therefore, I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.a. It should be \nreiterated that AG \u00b6 31(b) applies \u201cregardless of whether the individual was formally \ncharged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n  \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). In that regard, I have given full weight to the \ncharacter reference email sent on November 9, 2021, by an AGA complimenting \nApplicant on his \u201cOutstanding IT Support & Customer Service.\u201d \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant failed to meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nWITHDRAWN BY GOVERNMENT \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.k   \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:     \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:     \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nPhilip J.

His most recent marriage was to a citizen of Nigeria, \ngiving rise to the security concerns under Guideline B. \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts, including federal tax debts for tax years \n2011, 2015, and 2018. The evidence concerning the debts is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: federal tax debt of $3,050 for tax year 2011. Applicant testified that \nhe worked overseas for six months and then vacationed in another overseas country for \nfour months, erroneously thinking that the four months of overseas vacation continued \nhis eligibility for tax-exempt status.

The debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: federal tax debt of $2,790 and failure to file for tax year 2015. \nApplicant testified that he was living in a high-cost area in 2015, and when he computed \nhis taxes, he found that he could not afford to pay them. (Tr. 43-44.) He filed this return \nin March 2021. (Tr. 60-61.) He did not submit any evidence of payments on this tax debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: federal tax debt of $509 for tax year 2018. Applicant testified that \nthis debt was for tax preparation and that he did not pay it immediately because his \nfinancial situation was uncertain, and then he forgot about it. (Tr. 46-47.)

As of the date of the hearing, he had not taken any action to \nresolve this debt. (Tr. 49-50.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: medical debt placed for collection of $2,699. Applicant testified that \nthis debt was incurred for ambulance service after he was injured in a gym, and it was not \ncovered by insurance. As of the date of the hearing, he had not taken any action to resolve \nthis debt. (Tr. 51.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: debt to jewelry store placed for collection of $548.

Applicant testified that he incurred these loans for his own education, \nand they became delinquent in 2017. He consolidated his loans in 2020 but could not \nafford the payments. He applied for consolidation again in 2021, which was approved, but \nhe did not make any payments after the consolidation. At present, he is not making any \npayments because of the COVID-19 deferment. He testified that he has saved $35,000 \nto pay off the loans in a lump sum by the end of 2022.

(Tr. 63.) \nApplicant testified that he currently earns about $60,000 per year, which is exempt \nfrom federal income taxes because he is overseas. (Tr. 35.) His contract provides for \nbase pay of $10.00 per hour, with an overtime rate of 125% of base pay, holiday pay of \n200% of base pay, and a completion bonus of 10% of base pay for regular hours worked \nat the completion of the 12-month contract. (AX C.) His gross monthly pay for the two-\nweek period ending on August 27, 2022, was $1,629. (AX D.) \nWhen Applicant\u2019s ex-wife passed away in 2021, his daughter began living with a \ngrandparent, and his child-support obligation of about $400-450 per month stopped. He \nopened a joint bank account with his daughter, and he deposits about $250 per month \ninto the account. (Tr. 65-66.) In addition, he sends his disabled mother a total of about \n$3,000 per year, and he sends his disabled father about $6,000 per year. (Tr. 67-68.) He \nsent his son $3,000 last Christmas. (Tr. 69.) \nApplicant met his most recent wife in 2018 through social media. He was on active \nduty in the USAR at the time, and he took leave for five weeks to meet with her in Nigeria. \nHe proposed marriage, she accepted, and they were married in Nigeria. Applicant \nreturned to his overseas duty station, and his wife came to the United States in March \n2021 on a temporary green card. She stayed with Applicant\u2019s mother for a while and then \nmoved out in June 2021. However, his ex-wife continues to use Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s \naddress as a point of contact. His ex-wife has two children, ages 11 and 6, who stayed in \nNigeria with her family. He has no feelings of obligation for her children. \nApplicant decided that a divorce was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d because they were \nunable to live together. They were divorced in January 2022. The terms of the divorce \nincluded a payment of $11,000 to his wife to make sure that she was financially stable. \n(AX A; Tr. 25-26.) He remains in contact with his ex-wife, talking to her every week or \ntwo. His ex-wife\u2019s green card will expire in March 2023, and he expects that she will return \nto Nigeria. Applicant testified that he wrote a letter to U.S. immigration authorities, \nrequesting that any application for a permanent green card be denied. (Tr. 28.) His ex-\nwife\u2019s father is deceased, and her mother has no connection to the Nigerian government \nor military. (Tr. 30-34.)  \nNigeria is a federal republic with an elected president.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant encountered several conditions \nbeyond his control: his multiple divorces, the death of his ex-wife that shifted the entire \nfinancial burden of caring for his daughter to him, and injuries not covered by insurance. \nHis mistaken belief that his pay was tax-exempt after he left his overseas job and spent \nfour months on vacation was not a condition beyond his control. He has acted responsibly \nregarding two of his tax debts, but he has not acted responsibly regarding the other debts \nalleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and his financial problems are not yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the tax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c.

He testified that he had made \narrangements to pay the utility bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n, but he submitted no evidence \nthat he had made any payments. A promise to pay or otherwise resolve a delinquent debt \nin the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner or \notherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 (App. Bd. \nSept. 26, 2019). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is partially established. Applicant paid the taxes due for tax years 2011 \nand 2018, and he has filed his past-due return for tax year 2015. He submitted no \nevidence that he has paid or has made a payment agreement for tax year 2015. His partial \ncompliance with his tax obligations by filing the past-due return for 2015 does not end the \ninquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is an \nevaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The fact that \nApplicant has filed his past-due return \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of \nApplicant\u2019s security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014).  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. See ISCR Case No. 12-05839 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). It is a level of risk one step above a State \nDepartment Level 1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal precaution\u201d) and equivalent to the \nLevel 2 advisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d). The State Department travel advisory for \nNigeria is Level 3 (reconsider travel) due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and violent crime.  \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife is currently living in the United States, but his former mother-\nin-law and his ex-wife\u2019s two children are living in Nigeria. Applicant did not express any \nfeelings of obligation toward his ex-wife\u2019s mother and children. However, notwithstanding \nthe divorce, Applicant has demonstrated feelings of obligation toward his ex-wife, and he \nremains in contact with her. He expects his ex-wife to return to Nigeria when her \ntemporary green card expires in March 2023. His continuing feelings of obligation to his \nex-wife and the unsettled conditions in Nigeria are sufficient to establish the \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) and the potential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s divorce, he continues to \nfeel an obligation to his ex-wife that is sufficient to raise a possibility of having to choose \nbetween the interests of his ex-wife and the interests of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s sense of obligation to his ex-wife is minimal \ncompared to his deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and B in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy and honorable military service. I have considered that he has worked for defense \ncontractors for many years and held a security clearance since January 2008. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his previous marriage to a Nigerian woman, but \nhe has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and tax \ndelinquencies. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017, and has been taking post-graduate courses part-time since 2019. He has worked as a software engineer for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 2017. Applicant reported in his SCA that his initial security clearance investigation was completed in December 2017, and he was granted a security clearance in January 2018. (Item 2) Applicant used and purchased marijuana while in high school and college, over a five-year period. He used marijuana a few times a week during the school year, but used it more often during summers. He purchased enough marijuana to last him about a month at a time. Although Applicant knew it was illegal, he didn\u2019t think his marijuana use was causing harm to anyone. He stopped using marijuana in 2016 because he thought that his continued use of it would impact his career and future.

He was afforded an \nopportunity to note objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation, and was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to do so. Applicant signed \nfor his receipt of the FORM on November 17, 2021. No subsequent response from \nApplicant was received by DOHA, and the case was assigned to me on February 9, \n2022.

He has worked as a software \nengineer for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 2017.

During \nthis time period, he graduated from college, started employment with a defense \ncontractor, and was granted a security clearance. Applicant started using illegal drugs \nagain in June 2019. (Items 2, 3) \nIn his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he used cocaine, hallucinogens, and \nstimulants while possessing a security clearance.

He reported using drugs while possessing a security clearance in \nhis interview with a government investigator. From June 2019 to December 2019, he \nused and purchased cocaine at least six times, at party and music festival settings. In \nJuly 2019, he used and purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD at a music \nfestival. In August 2019, he used and purchased ecstasy at a music festival. Applicant \ntold a government investigator that his motivation to start using drugs in 2019, after he \nhad stopped his marijuana use three years\u2019 prior, was for curiosity. (Items 1, 2, 3) \nApplicant stated in his SOR Answer that while he knows that drug use is not \ncondoned with a security clearance, he believes that they were done in safe \nenvironments, and did not pose a threat to himself, anyone around him, or national \nsecurity. He also asserts that he used illegal drugs in small amounts, experimentally, \nwith friends he trusts, who are \u201cupstanding citizens.\u201d He argues his illegal drug use was \ndone in controlled environments of his choosing, and that he was not coerced into any \nof this. He simply wanted to experience new things with friends. He asserts that he is an \n\u201cupstanding citizen\u201d without a criminal record, and that he raised the issue of his drug \nuse in his SCA. (Item 1) \nApplicant argues that his drug use did not have lasting physical or psychological \nimpairment, and had no impact on his life. He did not state in his Answer that his drug \nuse has completely stopped, or that he has no future intent to use illegal drugs. He \nasserts that he is an outstanding employee, and had received two promotions at work \nand good performance reviews. He provided no documentation substantiating these \nassertions. (Item 1) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are classified into five schedules, \nbased on their accepted medical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological \nand physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana, LSD, ecstasy, and \nhallucinogenic mushrooms (Psilocybin) are classified as Schedule I controlled \nsubstances, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, \nand no accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). Cocaine \nis classified as a Schedule II controlled substance based on its high potential for abuse, \nwith use potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence. \u00a7812(b)(2). \nApplicant admitted in his Answer that he used and purchased cocaine, ecstasy, \nLSD, and hallucinogenic mushrooms after being granted access to classified \ninformation. He also admitted that he used and purchased marijuana over a five-year \nperiod. Applicant failed to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(f), and 25(g) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used and purchased cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, and hallucinogenic \nmushrooms as recently as 2019. This drug involvement is recent, and is part of a larger \npattern of illegal drug use going back eleven years. He did not state in his Answer that \nhis drug use has completely stopped, or that he has no future intent to use illegal drugs. \nInstead he provided excuses and justifications for his drug involvement.

Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of illegal drugs continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to his \neligibility for a security clearance. AG \u00b6 25(a) does not apply. \nApplicant provided insufficient evidence to find that he has overcome his use of \nillegal drugs, or established a pattern of abstinence from his most recent illegal drug use \nstarting in 2019. While Applicant abstained from any illegal drug use for about three \nyears, he resumed using illegal drugs, and expanded his drug use beyond marijuana. \nApplicant started using drugs again while possessing a security clearance. Applicant \nadmitted to using these drugs with friends at parties and music festivals. He provided no \nevidence that he has disassociated from his drug-using friends, and no longer attends \nevents where illegal drugs are present. Furthermore, he provided no signed statement \nagreeing to abstain from future illegal drug use. AG \u00b6 25(b) does not apply. \nApplicant stated in his SCA that he stopped using marijuana in 2016 because his \ncontinued use would impact his career and future. He stated in his Answer that he knew \nillegal drug use is \u201cnot condoned\u201d with a security clearance. He made a commitment to \nthe government and his employer not to use illegal drugs when he applied for a security \nclearance. There is an entire section of the SCA that asks about \u201cIllegal Use of Drugs or \nDrug Activity\u201d. Similarly, Applicant was asked by a government investigator about illegal \ndrug use during his background interview. His admitted desire to experience new drugs \nwith friends at parties and music festivals, clearly outweighed his professional \ncommitments and responsibilities. Applicant\u2019s drug use is recent and it occurred while \nhe held a security clearance. He cannot be trusted to follow the rules and regulations \nrequired to handle and protect classified information. \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201ca person who broke a promise to abide by drug \nlaws after having been placed on notice that drug use is not compatible with access to \nclassified information has not demonstrated the quantum of reliability expected of those \nwith access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, \n2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nIn this case, Applicant offered little whole-person evidence to consider. He \nprovided no documentary evidence in his answer to support his claims that he is an \n\u201coutstanding employee\u201d or an \u201cupstanding citizen\u201d. In fact, the record clearly shows \notherwise. Applicant broke his commitment to the government and to his employer, to \nabstain from illegal drug use while possessing a security clearance. He repeatedly \nviolated federal and state laws every time he used and purchased illegal drugs. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer shows that he has no regard for the law, and he doesn\u2019t think that \nhe has to follow it. \nApplicant puts his social life before his professional responsibilities, and does not \npossess the judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability to handle or protect classified \ninformation. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns of \nillegal drug use and purchase while granted access to classified information, or his \nearlier five-year involvement with marijuana. Applicant failed to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to discontinue future drug involvement. All of this continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to his eligibility for a security \nclearance. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on November 3, 2021.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 30 years old and married, with no children. After graduating high \nschool in 2009, she attended three years of college, but did not earn a degree. After \nleaving college in 2012, Applicant worked in various jobs, including as a caterer, a retail \nassistant manager, a loan processer, and a hospital receptionist. She experienced two \nperiods of unemployment. In January 2018, she left her job as a hospital receptionist to \ncare for ill family members and remained unemployed until October 2018. In December \n2019, she lost her retail job because the store closed, and she remained unemployed at \nleast through the completion of her SF86 in August 2020. Applicant lived with her \nparents from 2008 through completion of her Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF86) in August 2020. (GE 3) \nApplicant funded her college education through federal student loans, and those \nloans form the bulk of her financial delinquencies. The SOR alleges eight defaulted \nstudent loans that first became delinquent in 2016 and are now held by the Department \nof Education (DoE); they total $47,764. In addition to the student loans, the SOR alleges \na delinquent consumer account of $506 and four delinquent medical debts that total \n$1,727. The delinquent loans and debts are established through credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. (GE 2, 4, 5) \nIn addition to the DoE student loans alleged in the SOR, Applicant took out three \nNelnet federal student loans that are not alleged, as they were in deferment when the \nSOR was issued. Those loans total $19,835. Throughout the adjudicative process, \nApplicant apparently conflated the Nelnet and DoE loans. In her background interview \nof September 2020, Applicant asserted that she was on a payment plan of $5 per month \nfor all of her student loans, both Nelnet and DoE, but stopped payments in July 2020 as \nthe loans were being transferred to a new lender. The credit reports do not support \nApplicant\u2019s understanding that the DoE and Nelnet loans were in any way consolidated. \nIn her FORM response of September 2021, Applicant stated her intent to pay all her \nstudent loans and submitted documents pertaining both to the DoE loans and the \nNelnet loans. (GE 4, 5, 6; AE B, C) I have not considered any derogatory information \nthat was not alleged for disqualifying purposes. I may consider it in making a credibility \ndetermination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in my whole-person \nanalysis. \nThe documents submitted by Applicant indicate that she was recently accepted \ninto a loan rehabilitation program for her defaulted DoE loans. In August 2021, she \nsigned an agreement committing to monthly payments of $242. The record does not \nconfirm any payments under this plan. Additionally, Applicant submitted documents \nindicating that she entered into an income-based repayment plan with Nelnet and had \nmade two payments of $190 under that plan as of September 2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, primarily student loans that first \nbecame delinquent in 2016. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant was unemployed on two occasions after leaving college in 2012. In \nJanuary 2018, she left her job to care for ill family members and remained unemployed \nuntil October 2018. In December 2019, she lost her retail job when the store closed and \nremained unemployed at least through the completion of her SF86 in August 2020. I \nfind that these events were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. \nThe question is whether Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nTurning first to the medical account delinquencies, Applicant started to address them in \nearnest in December 2020, making several payments through August 2021 that totaled \n$571 and satisfied three of the four debts alleged. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c and 1.d are \nconcluded for Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans, however, form the bulk of her financial debts, and she \nhas failed to establish a reliable track record in resolving them. Applicant\u2019s DoE \naccounts were delinquent in June 2016 and categorized as seriously delinquent in \nSeptember 2017, well before Applicant\u2019s first period of unemployment. The evidence \nindicates that Applicant entered into a rehabilitation program for the DoE loans in \nAugust 2021, five years after they first became delinquent and shortly after the SOR \nwas issued. At about the same time, Applicant entered into an income-based repayment \nplan on her Nelnet loans. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only \nafter having been placed on notice that her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when her personal interests are \nnot threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant states her intent to pay off all the student loans. However, intentions to \npay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other \nresponsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nConsequently, Applicant\u2019s nascent efforts to rehabilitate her DoE loans and to begin \npayments on her other student loan debt do not provide significant mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 20 (d). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above mitigating \nconditions fully apply. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain \ndespite the presence of some mitigation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nongoing efforts to resolve her medical debts and non-alleged debts. However, those \npositive factors are insufficient to overcome Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence in the FORM is sufficient to raise the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were recent, frequent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2013, because it \nwas preceded by multiple periods of unemployment and underemployment.

Applicant filed her past-due returns (not alleged) and \nsystematically paid her tax debt. She completed a loan rehabilitation program and \nconsolidated her student loans. Her loans are in forbearance, and the estimated \npayments after the period of forbearance ends are well within her ability to pay them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by her \nfinancial problems. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In his FORM response, he \namended his answer and admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, and partially \nadmitted and denied \u00b6 1.k. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He is not married and has no children. He served in the \nArmy Reserve from May 2010 until March 2018 and was honorably discharged.

(Items 2, 3) \nApplicant attended college at three different institutions from January 2009 to May \n2010; January 2013 to December 2013; and April 2017 to December 2017, and earned \na technical certificate. He funded his education with student loans from the Department \nof Education (DOE). These loans are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h and total \napproximately $22,395. Applicant disclosed on his January 2020 security clearance \napplication (SCA) that the loans had been delinquent since approximately 2016. (Items \n2, 3, 5, 6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that his student loans were \ndeferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that he began a rehabilitation \nprogram with DOE in 2021 and is making payments of $150 a month. He intends to \ncontinue making payments until the loans are resolved. He provided a copy of a \nrepayment agreement dated June 21, 2021, showing the balance owed on his defaulted \nstudent loans was $22,136. It also showed his first payment was due January 2022. A \ndocument reflecting his account payments shows a payment of $132 made in November \n2021 and another payment of $150 made in January 2022. A letter from DOE reflects that \nhe made six consecutive payments, which makes him eligible for DOE Title IV aid. He did \nnot provide evidence of when the payments were made and the amounts. (AE A, B, C) \nApplicant disclosed in his January 2020 security clearance application (SCA) that \nhe failed to pay his 2017 federal income tax due to financial and personal hardship. He \nestimated he owed about $2,800. He also disclosed that he failed to file his 2018 federal \nincome tax return due to financial hardship. He estimated he owed $3,000.

He amended this answer in his FORM \nresponse explaining he understands he owes back taxes. He stated he has filed all of his \ntax returns and begun making payments on the balance owed. He confirmed his tax debt \nfor tax year 2017 is $5,269 and 2018 is $6,375. He said he is making payments of at least \n$300 a month, but will make payments of up to $500 a month when feasible. There is no \nevidence of an installment agreement with the IRS. Applicant provided a document \nreflecting a payment of $500 was made to the IRS in November 2021 and another one of \n$300 was made in January 2022. (AE F, G) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($5,761) is for a collection account for an apartment \nthat Applicant rented with two roommates and they broke the lease in 2016. One \nroommate reneged leaving Applicant and his other roommate to pay the entire rent, which \nthey could not afford. Despite attempts to rectify the situation, including speaking with the \nproperty manager, they were unable to pay the rent and were evicted. In Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 2020 SCA, he indicated he was working with the collection agency to settle the \ndebt. He provided a letter from August 2020 showing he resolved the debt. (AE E, G) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($749) is a collection account from 2016. It was due to an overpayment \nto Applicant by the Government. Applicant stated that he resolved the debt in either 2019 \nor 2020, but the creditor would not verify the date the debt was paid. He provided a \ndocument verifying the debt is resolved. (AE D, G) \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to a period between 2015 and 2017. He \nindicated that in 2015 he was earning minimum wage, and he was evicted from his \napartment. He was living in his friend\u2019s car for eight months. The car was repossessed so \nhe had to live in a motel. He decided to move to seek new opportunities and while driving \ncross country with his friend, the police stopped them. His stated his friend had a \nmarijuana vape pen and marijuana grinder in the car, and they were arrested. He paid a \nlawyer to resolve the charge, which took over a year. He was unemployed from October \n2016 to January 2017. (Item 2; AE G) \nApplicant began living with his father in approximately October 2016 and in \nJanuary 2017 he began a new job and was earning $15.50 an hour. In January 2020, he \nbegan a new job and his annual salary was $68,000. In October 2021, he changed jobs \nand his annual salary was $72,000. He recently moved to another job and he stated he \nwas making more money than he has ever before. He did not say the amount. Applicant \nprovided a copy of his budget, which reflects payments to the IRS and DOE for his student \nloans. It also reflects he has $202 remaining in expendable income at the end of the \nmonth.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant had student loans totaling more than $22,000 that were delinquent from \nabout 2016. He failed to timely pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2017 and 2018. \nHe also had two accounts that were in collection. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant \nattributed \nhis \nfinancial \ndifficulties \nto \nunderemployment \nand \nunemployment from 2015 to 2017 and from having difficulties after a roommate reneged \non his portion of their rent. These were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant became employed in January 2017, but did not provide an \nexplanation for why he failed to contact DOE until approximately 2021 to address his \ndelinquent student loans. Although the CARES Act has placed student loans in \ndeferment, it does not negate the years of inattention toward addressing his student \nloans. Applicant could have contacted DOE and requested a deferment due to his \nunemployment and underemployment or requested an income-based payment plan. \nThere is no evidence that he did. Applicant failed to pay his federal income taxes for tax \nyears 2017 and 2018. He did not provide an explanation for why he failed to pay his taxes, \nother than he was having financial and personal hardships. He was obviously earning \nincome during this period, but he did not elaborate on why he did not contact the IRS and \nestablish a payment plan to pay his taxes. He indicated in his January 2020 SCA that he \nhad a tax professional and intended to implement a payment plan within a month. He did \nnot provide evidence that he has a payment plan with the IRS. He provided evidence of \ntwo payments made towards his delinquent federal taxes. He also disclosed that in 2018, \nhe traveled to the Dominican Republic for six to ten days for tourism.

AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication. \nApplicant resolved the collection accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j in \napproximately 2019 and 2021 respectively. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to those debts. DOE noted \nthat Applicant had made six consecutive payments on his delinquent student loans, \npresumably sometime in 2021. The amount is unknown. He also made two subsequent \npayments. Although, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to his student loans in that he is now making \npayments on them, it is insufficient to fully mitigate the security concerns for his failure to \naddress the delinquent loans in a timely manner. He was employed in 2017, but there is \nno evidence he attempted to address the delinquent student loans until 2020 or 2021. He \ndid not provide the date of his first payment. Applicant failed to provide a reasonable \nexplanation for why he did not address his tax debt for several years. He has not \nestablished a consistent payment record regarding his taxes. He did not provide evidence \nthat he has an installment agreement with the IRS. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) do not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s tax debt is ongoing and recent. His failure to timely pay his 2017 and \n2018 federal income taxes casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI have considered that Applicant went through a difficult financial period and was \nunderemployed and unemployed. He began steady employment in January 2017 and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwas responsible for paying his federal income taxes, regardless of how much he earned. \nHe failed to do so for two tax years and has a significant tax debt. No evidence was \npresented that he has a payment plan with the IRS. Failure to comply with tax laws \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government \nrules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as \npaying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \nAlthough Applicant may have been unable to make payments on his student loans, \nhe did not contact DOE for years after the loans were in a default status. At this juncture, \nApplicant has failed to establish a reliable financial track record and it is too early to \nconclude that he will continue to make consistent payment on his student loans and \ndelinquent taxes. Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n* \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Applicant was not a business partner. Because of their friendship, he was confident that LF was trustworthy and reliable and would repay him. Applicant used cash advances from credit cards and loans to help his friend purchase equipment for the business and for operating expenses. LF was making payments to Applicant until approximately 2017 or 2018 when he stopped. They did not have a written agreement regarding repayment of the loans or credit card expenditures.

Applicant used cash advances from credit cards and \nloans to help his friend purchase equipment for the business and for operating expenses. \nLF was making payments to Applicant until approximately 2017 or 2018 when he stopped. \nThey did not have a written agreement regarding repayment of the loans or credit card \nexpenditures. Applicant knew he was responsible for paying the amounts owed on the \ncredit cards and loans. He has been unable to locate LF since about 2018. None of his \nfamily know where he is located. (Tr. 23-27) \nApplicant was making regular timely payments on the credit cards and loans \nalleged in the SOR. None of his financial obligations were delinquent. His payment history \nis supported by entries on his credit report that show he was current in his payments until \n2019. He decided because he had a lot of debt he wanted to use the expertise of a credit \nresolution service. In May 2019, he contracted for the services of CLG who promised him \nto help resolve all of his debts. He would make monthly payments to CLG, who would \nthen negotiate and settle his debts. CLG advised Applicant to stop making payments on \nall of his debts, even though they were not in a default status. Applicant followed their \ndirections, believing CLG was operating in good faith and would use his payments to \nsettle his debts. Applicant made monthly payments of $843 from May 2019 to \napproximately September 2021. He paid approximately $24,447 to CLG. He credibly \ntestified that during that time, CLG settled one debt for approximately $1,000.

When he did, he realized it had horrendous ratings and \ncomments about its service and consumer reputation. He provided copies of complaints \nmade on the website to the Better Business Bureau. They all corroborate that CLG is \nunscrupulous. Applicant terminated his agreement with them in October 2021 and was \nreimbursed approximately $6,745. (Tr. 27-30; AE G, I) \nAfter Applicant terminated the agreement with CLG, he contacted the creditors \nwho owned the debts alleged in the SOR to discuss making payments or negotiating \nsettlement agreements. Applicant settled the debt to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He \nprovided supporting documentation. (Tr. 30-31, 33; AE J, K) \nApplicant was notified by the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b that it was seeking a judgment \nagainst him for the debt. He hired an attorney to attempt to settle the debt before the \njudgment was entered, but was untimely. His attorney has sent a letter to the creditor \nattempting to make payment arrangements to settle the debt, but the creditor has been \nunresponsive. He is actively attempting to resolve the debt. (Tr. 34-39; AE B, C, H) \nApplicant has repeatedly contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c to make payment \narrangements to settle the debt. His calls are directed to an automated response that \nadvises him that his debt has been sold to a collection company, and he will receive a \nletter in the next two to three weeks regarding the debt. He credibly testified that he has \ncontacted the creditor at least ten times and gets the same message and can never talk \nto a person. Applicant is attempting to resolve the debt. (Tr. 40-41) \nApplicant negotiated a settlement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He will make six \nmonthly payments. He provided proof that he has made the first payment. This debt was \nfor a loan he secured for LF. (Tr. 41-46: AE N, O) \nApplicant contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e about five months ago to discuss \nsettling the debt. The creditor only had an answer machine, and he was unable to talk to \nanyone. He plans to continue to make payments and resolve his other debts, so he can \nbe in a better position to make a settlement offer with this creditor in the future. He will \ncontinue to attempt to resolve the debt. (Tr. 46-47) \nApplicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. His stepdaughter had his permission to write \na check on his account. The check was returned because the bank believed she was an \nunauthorized user. When he contacted the bank, he was told it would process the check \nagain, but it did not. Applicant paid the debt when he learned it had not been processed. \nHe provided supporting documents. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 55-57; AE D, E) \nApplicant maintains a detailed budget and provided a copy. He lives within his \nmeans and has no other outstanding debts. He pays the balance on his credit cards each \nmonth. He made regular payments on his student loans until they were deferred due to \nthe pandemic. Applicant takes full responsibility for resolving all of his debts.

(Tr. 48-56; AE M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in\nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control,\njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant incurred debts when he decided to help his friend. The friend failed to \nmake the payments required on the debts. After Applicant contracted with CLG to assist \nhim in resolving his debts, they advised him to stop paying all of his debt, causing them \nto become delinquent. Despite paying CLG more than $24,000, it resolved only one debt. \nApplicant has delinquent debts that he was unable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant tried to help a friend who reneged on his financial obligations to him. \nApplicant contracted with a debt relief company that despite receiving more than $24,000 \nplaced him in a worse financial position. The company did not cause the debts to become \ndelinquent. They advised him to let them become delinquent, but he was the cause. \nApplicant has been digging himself out of a difficult financial situation. He takes \nresponsibility for his actions and is systematically resolving his delinquent accounts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties happened under unique circumstances, are unlikely to \nrecur, and do not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) applies. \nApplicant financial problems were caused by his friend\u2019s failure to follow through \nwith his promise to repay him. Applicant may have been altruistic and na\u00efve when he \nchose to take loans to help his friend, but he was trying to do a good thing. The fact his \nfriend failed him was beyond his control. He has acted responsibly in addressing his \ndelinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial counseling, but there \nare clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved and under control. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) partially applies. He has initiated good-faith efforts to pay his creditors and resolve \nhis debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nI conclude Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline \nF, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

(Transcript (Tr.) 21- 22) Applicant admitted that he drank alcohol at times to excess beginning in the 1980s. On November 12, 1996, he began abstaining from alcohol consumption, went back to church, and participated in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He admitted he relapsed twice, once in 2015 and again in 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The first relapse was initially reported as 2016, but it was 2015. (Tr. 23-24, 26, 74) In September 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He disclosed that in 1996, he believed he was consuming too much alcohol. He was having drinks with his friends after work, which turned into a daily occurrence. His wife did not approve and it had a negative impact on his family. He confided in his supervisor who assisted him in entering an inpatient alcohol treatment program. He was hospitalized for three days, was treated for alcohol use disorder, and upon his release, he began attending AA and church, which he found helpful in maintaining his sobriety (SOR \u00b6 1.c).

DOHA received the hearing transcript on October 21, 2022.  \nProcedural Matters \nThe Government moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing \u00b6 1.b. There was no \nobjection and the motion was granted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e and 1.g. He denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6 1.d, 1.f and 1.h. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years old and a high school graduate. He married in 1981 and has \ntwo adult children. He has worked for federal contractors since 2007. (Transcript (Tr.) 21-\n22) \nApplicant admitted that he drank alcohol at times to excess beginning in the 1980s. \nOn November 12, 1996, he began abstaining from alcohol consumption, went back to \nchurch, and participated in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He admitted he relapsed twice, \nonce in 2015 and again in 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The first relapse was initially reported as \n2016, but it was 2015. (Tr. 23-24, 26, 74) \nIn September 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \ndisclosed that in 1996, he believed he was consuming too much alcohol. He was having \ndrinks with his friends after work, which turned into a daily occurrence. His wife did not \napprove and it had a negative impact on his family. He confided in his supervisor who \nassisted him in entering an inpatient alcohol treatment program. He was hospitalized for \nthree days, was treated for alcohol use disorder, and upon his release, he began \nattending AA and church, which he found helpful in maintaining his sobriety (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nHe testified that he did not consume alcohol until he relapsed in 2015. (Tr. 33, 48-50; GE \n8) \nApplicant told the investigator that in November 2015, while on a work trip he and \nhis coworkers had Sunday off. They went to church and later to the beach. Applicant was \noffered a drink from a bottle of alcohol that was being passed around. He said he took a \nswig and that was the first drink he had since 1996. He then went swimming, slipped, and \nhit his head. He did not believe he was intoxicated or that alcohol contributed to him \nfalling, but when he was treated for his head injury, the doctor smelled alcohol. He told \nthe doctor about his history of sobriety and AA. The doctor decided to send him home \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nearly due to the limited amount of medical care available in the remote location where \nthey were. Applicant said he reported the incident to his supervisor upon his return. He \ntestified that he did consume alcohol at that time, but did not drink to excess. He told the \ndoctor he was active in AA and believed that information along with his head injury, which \nhe described as minor, is \n \nwhy the doctor sent him home. He stated that in 2015, he was \nattending AA daily because he was helping a person from church with his sobriety, so he \nattended with him. He said this was the first drink he had since 1996. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges \nthe incident occurred in January 2016 and Applicant said it occurred in 2016. The actual \nincident took place in 2015 and his treatment occurred in January 2016. (Tr. 27-30, 50-\n52; GE 8) \nApplicant told the investigator that due to concerns by his employer about his \nalcohol use, he voluntarily submitted to an alcohol evaluation with his employee \nassistance program. From January 2016 to March 2016, he participated in three \ncounseling sessions at BA, a treatment center. A letter from his counselor stated that \nApplicant had been sober for 18 years and attended AA. He had an excellent \nunderstanding of addiction and there was no need for further counseling. No disciplinary \naction was taken nor were there any security concerns noted. Applicant testified \nessentially to the same facts at his hearing. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) (Tr. 34-37, 52-55; GE 3, 8) \nApplicant told the investigator that in March 2018 he had minor surgery on his leg \nand arm and was not prescribed any pain medication. He was driving home from the \nsurgery center, was in pain, and was anxious about being off work. He impulsively \npurchased two airplane-size bottles of alcohol that were each about two ounces. He drank \nthe bottles. He then proceeded to drive home and clipped the mirror on a truck with the \nmirror on his car. He did not purchase over-the-counter pain medication because he was \ngoing to go home and sleep and thought the alcohol was the easiest way to sleep. At the \ntime, he did not realize he had clipped the mirror until the driver of the truck pursued him \nand Applicant pulled his car over. The driver called the police. The police detected alcohol \non Applicant. He failed a field sobriety test and was arrested for driving under the influence \nof alcohol (DUI). Applicant testified that he passed the field sobriety test, except for \nwalking in a straight line, which he had difficulty due to the surgery on his leg and pain \nassociated with it. A breathalyzer test was conducted and it recorded .13% and a second \ntest recorded .11%. Applicant disputed the results due to the amount of alcohol he said \nhe had consumed. He was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident with \ndamage to property and careless driving, misdemeanors. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) (Tr. 30-33, 37, 57-\n61; GE 8) \nApplicant testified essentially to the same facts. He acknowledged he used bad \njudgment. He explained he was not swerving, but the truck had extended trailer mirrors \nthat were lightly fastened to the truck. He further explained that the breathalyzer was not \nworking correctly at the time. Two men were trying to fix the breathalyzer while he was at \nthe police station. He waited about four or five hours for them to fix it before the test was \nadministered. He did not agree with the results because based on what he said he had \nto drink, the reading was too high. The DUI charge was reduced to reckless driving and \nthe other charges were dismissed. Applicant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe court withheld adjudication based on Applicant\u2019s compliance with the court orders. He \npaid the associated fine, completed community service, and completed the other \nrequirements. (Tr. 30-33, 37-38, 77-79; GE 6) \nAfter Applicant\u2019s arrest, he was required to report to his state\u2019s safety council, \nwhich recommended he participate in alcohol counseling, which he did from April 2018 to \nJune 2018, attending 15 sessions. Het disputes the information on the intake \nquestionnaire that is part of the packet from the counseling center, BA. (GE 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that in April 2018, Applicant provided misleading statements to \na mental health professional (MHP) evaluating his alcohol use. The allegation states \u201cYou \nstated you drank \u2018two airplane bottles of liquor\u2019 before your DUI arrest in March 2018; \nwhen in truth, it was determined you drank five full alcoholic beverages prior to your \narrest.\u201d Applicant has consistently stated he drank two airplane bottles of alcohol. He \ncredibly testified that he told the MHP that he drank two airplane bottles of alcohol. He \nexplained that the MHP completed the questionnaire, not him. The form is not in \nApplicant\u2019s handwriting, but is typewritten. He disputed what she put on the form. He \ncredibly testified that she told him that it did not matter what was on the form, he was \ngoing to therapy. He said he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions that she checked \u201cyes\u201d. The form \nasks \u201cType/amount consumed/used\u201d and in the space provided in typed words, it states \n\u201cverbal: 2-2 ounce bottles. Written 2 airplane bottles.\u201d Under the section which asked, \u201cIf \nbreath test refused, why?\u201d [she] typed in \u201cBAC .113/.108=5 drinks at time of testing.\u201d He \ntestified that one question asked how often he would drink to have fun and the answer on \nthe form said almost all of the time. He testified that he would never have said that. \nAnother question asked how many days a week he consumed alcohol and the answer \nsaid seven. He said this was false. There were numerous other questions that Applicant \nsaid the answers were not his. I believe him. (Tr. 38-43, 60-62; GE 4 pages 42-62) \nMany of the questions used the word \u201cever.\u201d Applicant clearly stated that he had \nan alcohol problem prior to 1996 and he relapsed once in 2016 and 2018, when he was \narrested for DUI. He disputed many of the answers on the questionnaire as misleading \nby indicating that he had a current problem and was regularly drinking alcohol, which he \nstated he was not. He testified that other than these two relapses, he has not consumed \nalcohol and did not consume it after his 2018 arrest. I believe there may be confusion in \nthe questionnaire in that Applicant was responding to questions about his entire alcohol \nhistory and not about his recent relapse and use of alcohol. The document does note that \nApplicant refers to his relapse in 2016 and his second relapse in 2018. This also appears \nto be the issue when Applicant was responding to government interrogatories. He was \nreferring to his alcohol use prior to 1996. He testified that he only consumed alcohol twice \nafter 1996. (Tr. 38-43, 66-72; GE 2, 4) \nApplicant participated in the BA outpatient treatment from April 2018 to June 2018 \nand was diagnosed by a qualified mental health professional with alcohol use disorder, \nrelapse. He completed the program with a final diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, in early \nremission. His prognosis was good. The MHP recommended he continue to participate \nin AA.

She determined Applicant was not \nforthcoming with information, was inconsistent with his responses, and therefore he was \neither untruthful or in denial of his alcohol use disorder condition. She determined that \nApplicant was at high risk for relapse, and there were significant concerns about his \nreliability, judgment, and trustworthiness, and his prognosis was poor. (Tr. 44; GE 7) \nApplicant disputed the GMHP findings and stated that he was frustrated with her \nbecause she did not seem familiar with the steps of the AA program and seemed to \ndisregard his active participation in AA as significant. He believed she was more of a \nscience person than a spiritual person. Applicant explained that he is active in his church \nand has been a deacon for 17 years. He took his time answering the GMHP\u2019s questions, \nwhich she characterized as responses as being elusive, but he said he was being \ncautious and thoughtful, realizing his answers were important. He believed she \ninterpreted that as not being forthright. The GMHP did not agree with his use of his church \nand AA for help with his alcoholism and abstinence. His spiritual participation with his \nchurch and with AA is what he practices. She did not agree with him regarding step two \nof AA that is accepting a power greater than oneself and step three to turn over one\u2019s \ndecisions to God. He felt there was tension with her because she did not agree with him \nthat AA has kept him from consuming alcohol. He admitted that during the past 26 years \nof sobriety he has had two relapses in 2015 and 2018. He was surprised by the GMHP\u2019s \nresponses to his commitment to AA. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 44-46; \nGE 7) \nApplicant testified that he has had two relapses since 1996, once in 2015 and \nanother in 2018, as noted above. He has participated in AA since 1996. He believes he \nhas taken responsibility for his actions. Applicant attends two AA meetings a week. He \nhad a sponsor, who passed away about nine years ago. He has an accountability partner \nwho he is in contact with every day. They inquire on how they are doing and they share \ndevotionals. He continues to participate in the AA 12-step program. He is an active \nmember of the musical group in his church. He believes he is a recovering alcoholic and \nwill be forever. (Tr. 62-64, 75 \nApplicant read a character letter from his wife. She stated that they were brought \nup in very strict Christian homes that did not allow smoking, drinking, dancing, or going \nto movies. She believes because of their background that any alcohol consumption was \nconsidered heavy and that this is why Applicant has referred in the past to his heavy use \nof alcohol. She stated that Applicant abstained from alcohol consumption in the 1990s, \nbegan attending AA, and the family went back to church. He has been a deacon in the \nchurch for 17 years, taught Sunday school, and was in charge of counting and depositing \nthe church\u2019s offerings. He plays in the band at church every Sunday. He shares his faith \n\u201ceven to people, sometimes therapists, who aren\u2019t receptive.\u201d She acknowledges he \nmade a reckless mistake in 2018 when he used alcohol. He took responsibility for his \nactions. He is a great husband, father, and friend who is trusted by his bosses.

(AE B-M) \nPolicies  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support that Applicant is a recovering alcoholic and \nconsumed alcohol from the 1980s until 1996 and again in 2015 and 2018. He participated \nin an inpatient treatment program in 1996 and was treated for alcohol use disorder. He \nrelapsed in 2015 and 2018, when he drank alcohol. He was to remain abstinent. In 2015, \nhe drank alcohol on a Sunday, his day off, while he was on a work trip. He was arrested \nin 2018 for DUI, after consuming alcohol. He was also charged with careless driving, and \nleaving the scene of an accident with property damage. In 2018, he was diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder, in early remission. In February 2021, he was evaluated by a duly \nqualified mental health professional and diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate. \nShe determined Applicant was at high risk for relapse and had significant concerns about \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nhis reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. His prognosis was poor. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), \n22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) apply. \nI found there was insufficient evidence to conclude Applicant provided misleading \nstatements to the MHP evaluating his alcohol use. SOR \u00b6 1.f was alleged under the \nalcohol consumption guideline. None of the disqualifying conditions apply under this \nguideline. The factual allegation would have been appropriately alleged under Guideline \nE, personal conduct, but was not. Even if it was correctly alleged, I believe Applicant when \nhe stated that the MHP wrote her answers to the questions and not his. Many questions \nuse the word \u201cever\u201d which could cause confusion, and I believe it did in this case. \nApplicant has consistently stated to the MHP and in his testimony that he drank two \nairplane-bottle-size alcohol drinks. It is unclear the number of ounces in each bottle, but \nif there were two or more that could account for the level on the breathalyzer. The MHP \nwrote down five drinks based on the breathalyzer results. This does not equate to \nApplicant intentionally misleading the MHP. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant admits he is a recovering alcoholic and will be for the rest of his life. He \nwas abstinent from 1996 until 2015 when he consumed alcohol. He consumed alcohol \nagain in 2018 and was arrested for DUI. He has acknowledged these significant failures. \nHe has been sober since his March 2018 DUI arrest, more than four years. He was \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate. AA is a recognized and respected \nprogram for those with alcohol issues and is recommended by most treatment programs. \nApplicant has participated in AA since 1996. He currently attends AA twice a week. He is \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolved in his church.

He understands the difficulty of remaining sober, and although he has failed \ntwice, his commitment is evident by his abstinence and working the AA program. He \nreadily acknowledged his alcohol history and provided evidence to overcome his problem. \nHe believed that his commitment for seeking help from a higher power was not fully \nrecognized and dismissed by the GMHP. All of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a recovering alcoholic. Being an alcoholic does not prevent someone \nfrom holding a security clearance. He recognized his struggles with alcohol and abstained \nfor many years until he relapsed twice. He has not ignored his problems, but has been \nactively addressing them. I believe he is committed to his sobriety. Applicant has met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.c-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior material requirements planning (MRP) analyst with his current employer since October 1996. A 1991 high school graduate, he subsequently earned college credits but no degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was married in 2001, and divorced in 2007. He has been cohabiting since 2013. He was granted a secret clearance in 2017, but, in 2020, based on his history of drug involvement and substance misuse, he was denied eligibility for a continuing security clearance. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse During the period commencing in about June 1991, when he was in high school, and continuing until at least December 2018, Applicant was initially a curious recreational substance abuser, but eventually a regular self-medicating substance abuser, whose substance of choice was tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana - a Schedule I Controlled Substance.

Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a senior material requirements planning (MRP) analyst with his current employer since \nOctober 1996. A 1991 high school graduate, he subsequently earned college credits but \nno degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was married in 2001, and \ndivorced in 2007.

He was granted a secret clearance \nin 2017, but, in 2020, based on his history of drug involvement and substance misuse, he \nwas denied eligibility for a continuing security clearance. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nDuring the period commencing in about June 1991, when he was in high school, \nand continuing until at least December 2018, Applicant was initially a curious recreational \nsubstance abuser, but eventually a regular self-medicating substance abuser, whose \nsubstance of choice was tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana - a Schedule \nI Controlled Substance. (https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 \n(c); Item 2 \u2013 Answer to SOR, undated at 1) His use of marijuana during 2017 and 2018 \noccurred while he held a security clearance.

Although he claimed to have \nattended drug counseling in 2019, and felt the sessions were very helpful, he offered no \ndocumentation to describe the actual counseling or to verify the contention that \ncounseling actually took place. He claims that he is no longer motivated to use marijuana, \nciting his health and his career. He acknowledged that during the times of his admitted \nusage, he purchased the marijuana either from friends or a marijuana dispensary. (Item \n3 \u2013 2020 SF 86 at 26-28; Item 3 \u2013 Enhanced Subject Interview (ESI), dated October 27, \n2020, at 4-6)  \nPersonal Conduct \nIn his 2017 SF 86, under Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of drugs or Drug Activity, \nApplicant was asked the following question: \nIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, \nsnorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming \nany drug or controlled substance. \nHe replied \u201cno\u201d to the inquiry. (Item 5 \u2013 2017 SF 86 at 27) His response was false, for he \neventually admitted that he was using marijuana since June 1991. In fact, he was using \nmarijuana when he completed his 2017 SF 86, and he continued doing so until at least \nDecember 2018. During his OPM interview, Applicant said he was not truthful in his 2017 \nresponse because he was embarrassed about it. (Item 4 \u2013 ESI at 4) As noted above, \nbased on his false denial, Applicant was granted a secret clearance in 2017. In 2020, \nwhen his true history of drug involvement and substance misuse was revealed, he was \ndenied eligibility for a continuing security clearance. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \n \n \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining\nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative\nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law\npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains\nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always,\nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use\nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria.\nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with,\nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations,\nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons\nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n. . . disregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nAs discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board, conduct not alleged in an SOR (in this \ncase, his purchase of marijuana) may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's \ncredibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive \u00a7 6.3. \n(See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, \n2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s purchase of marijuana will be considered only for the five \npurposes listed above, not including any assessment of his credibility.  \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nDuring the period commencing in about June 1991, when he was in high school, \nand continuing until at least December 2018, Applicant was initially a curious recreational \nsubstance abuser, but eventually a regular self-medicating substance abuser, whose \nsubstance of choice was marijuana - a Schedule I Controlled Substance. During part of \nthat period (2017 \u2013 2018) he held a secret clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f) have been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) minimally applies, but none of the other mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant finally reported over two and one-half decades of recreational or self-medicating \nregular marijuana use, supposedly ceasing in about December 2018. He was finally open \nabout his use of marijuana when he completed his 2020 SF 86, and for that candor, he is \ngiven some credit. But, he offered no substantial or verifiable evidence of actions taken \nto overcome his drug involvement issues, such as exploring drug treatment and therapy; \nchanging or avoiding the environment where marijuana was used; providing a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, without \nany conditions; or evidence to support his claimed abstinence since December 2018. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \nover two and one-half decades of marijuana use, the relatively brief period of reported \nabstinence is considered insufficient to conclude that the abstinence will continue. \nApplicant made no statement regarding the legal status of his marijuana use. He \nseemingly ignored laws, rules, and regulations regarding such use. His use of marijuana \nfor such a lengthy period, including the period during which he held a security clearance, \ndespite the fact that such use was prohibited by both the Federal Government and \ngovernment contractors, continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse are \nadopted herein. In fact, one of the allegations under Guideline E is identical to the one \nunder Guideline H, and the credible adverse information alleged under Guideline H is \nsufficient for an adverse determination solely under that single guideline. In this instance \nhowever, there is also the evidence that Applicant falsified material facts in his 2017 SF \n86 regarding drug involvement simply because he was embarrassed about the truth. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(e) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. It includes: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nThe condition does not apply. Applicant has finally acknowledged using marijuana \nfor over two and one-half decades, including a period during which he held a security \nclearance, despite being aware of the Federal law, rules, and regulations, as well as with \nemployment rules and policies. Despite claiming that he had participated in drug \ncounseling, and that he has abstained since December 2018, he has failed to furnish any \nverifiable documentary evidence to support those claims. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 48-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior MRP analyst with his \ncurrent employer since October 1996. A 1991 high school graduate, he subsequently \nearned college credits but no degree. He was granted a secret clearance in 2017. He \nclaims that he has not used marijuana since December 2018. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational and eventually a self-medicating regular \nmarijuana abuser for over two and one-half decades (1991 \u2013 2018). During part of that \nperiod (2017 \u2013 2018) he held a secret clearance. The fact that he held a secret clearance \nwould essentially be a positive factor, but in this instance, it became a very negative factor \nbecause of his purchase and use of marijuana during that period. Applicant falsified \nmaterial facts in his 2017 SF 86 regarding drug involvement simply because he was \nembarrassed about the truth. There is no verifiable evidence of drug counseling or \nabstinence. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \n(1) through AG 2(d) (9). \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

They have three sons, ages 12, 9, and 8. \n(Item 5) Applicant has worked for a large defense contractor at a naval shipyard since \n2006. (Item 5) He has held a clearance for most of his career. (FORM Response) \nOn his SCA, Applicant reported a May 2019 DWI arrest and disclosed that he \nhad received a \u201cone-year suspension\u201d as a result. (Item 5) He discussed the offense \nand the resulting requirements in a July 2020 background interview, the summary of \nwhich he authenticated as accurate in a May 2021 interrogatory response. (Item 6) \nApplicant discussed the circumstances of his DWI arrest (SOR \u00b6 1.a) in his \nbackground interview. In May 2019, he had been at a local bar and consumed four or \nfive mixed drinks over a three- or four-hour period. He was pulled over while driving \nhome. The officer smelled alcohol on his breath and requested that Applicant submit to \na breathalyzer, which he refused. Applicant was arrested and detained overnight. (Item \n6 at 3; Item 7) \nApplicant acknowledged during his interview that he had been intoxicated. He \nwent to court, retained counsel, and pleaded guilty to DWI in September 2019. His \nlicense was restricted for one year, he was placed on one year of unsupervised \nprobation, and he was required to participate in alcohol safety classes. He was also \nfined. He was also required to have an ignition interlock device placed on his car and to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreport monthly so his compliance could be tested. (Item 6 at 3-4) Applicant was also \nordered to complete 10 weeks of alcohol education classes between October 2019 and \nDecember 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nBetween December 2019 and October 2020, Applicant incurred four violations of \nhis ignition interlock device. As a result, he was considered non-compliant with his \nalcohol education program on two occasions, in July 2020 and August 2020. The \nignition interlock program was extended for six months and he was ordered to attend \nsubstance abuse treatment. (Item 6 at 4; Items 10-12) (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nAfter his first ignition interlock violation in December 2019, Applicant was \nrequired to participate in an alcohol assessment. (Item 6 at 8-9). In February 2020, his \nassessor concluded that he did not meet criteria for alcohol treatment. (Item 9) \nFollowing his additional ignition interlock violations, Applicant was re-assessed in \nDecember 2020. He indicated to the assessor that \u201chis time was extended for an \nadditional six months\u201d (Item 12 at 2), which I interpret as an extension of his probation \nto March 2021 (beyond his initial one-year term, from September 2019 to September \n2020). When he was assessed, he met 3 of the 11 criteria for alcohol use disorder, mild \n(unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use; recurrent alcohol use in \nphysically hazardous situations; and tolerance as defined by need for marked increased \namounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect). (Item 12 at 3-4) \nApplicant was also re-enrolled in the alcohol safety program. He met the criteria \nfor an additional ten weeks of treatment and alcohol awareness education. (Item 12 at \n3-4) (SOR \u00b6 1.d) He completed that treatment program in March 2021, as required, \nthrough an on-line meeting platform. (Item 6 at 37-38; Item 8, Item 12 at 9) \nApplicant discussed his alcohol history in his background interview. He began \ndrinking at about age 18, at least sporadically. From age 21 until May 2019, the time of \nhis DWI, he consumed four to seven drinks of liquor or beer about three or four times a \nweek. Since his DWI, his drinking had decreased to three or four drinks about once or \ntwice a week at the time of his interview in July 2020. (Item 6 at 4) As of May 2021, \nApplicant reported that he no longer consumed alcoholic beverages and does not intend \nto do so in the future. (Item 6 at 34) \nIn his December 2021 FORM Response, Applicant added little new information. \nHe noted that he understood DOD\u2019s concerns. He asked that his 15-year career with his \nemployer be considered, including with a clearance, and said the events of the last two \nyears are not who he has been in the past or is today. (FORM Response) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \nApplicant was arrested in May 2019 and charged with DWI. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) AG \u00b6 \n22(a) applies. He received four violations of a court-ordered ignition interlock device \nbetween December 2019 and October 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) AG \u00b6 22(g) applies. \nAs a condition of Applicant\u2019s probation, he was ordered to complete ten weeks of \nalcohol education through an alcohol safety program from October 2019 to December \n2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) As a result of his ignition interlock violations, he was ordered to \nparticipate in substance abuse treatment. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) His participation in these \nprograms, however, constitutes mitigating rather than disqualifying conduct under \nGuideline G, even though they occurred as a result of his DWI and his ignition interlock \nviolations. No disqualifying AGs apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b or 1.d. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \nApplicant incurred a single DWI arrest in May 2019. Unfortunately, his time on \nprobation included four ignition interlock violations between December 2019 and \nOctober 2020. The significance of these four interlock failures is that Applicant \nattempted to operate his car four times while under the influence of some amount of \nalcohol. While he completed the subsequent treatment program in March 2021 (and \npresumably the extended probation period as well), Applicant has not demonstrated \nsufficient compliance with rules and regulations with respect to alcohol consumption to \nwarrant full application of the mitigating conditions. \nApplicant did not establish that his offenses occurred under unusual \ncircumstances, that his alcohol-related misconduct is unlikely to recur, or that it no \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlonger casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant completed the substance abuse treatment program in March 2021. AG \n\u00b6 23(d) applies. Applicant gets some credit under AG \u00b6 23(b) for his decreased alcohol \nintake since his DWI, but this is balanced against his multiple ignition interlock \nviolations. AG \u00b6 22(b) is not fully applicable, as he has not demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nUnder Guideline J in the SOR, the Government alleged a single cross-allegation, \nquoted in full as follows: \n2.a. \nThat information as set forth in subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d, above. \nCuriously, Applicant\u2019s May 2019 DWI (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was not included in the cross-\nallegation. Since it was not, it cannot be considered as disqualifying conduct under \nGuideline J, as it otherwise might have been. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d concern Applicant\u2019s \nparticipation in court-ordered alcohol education and treatment. No Guideline J \ndisqualifying AGs apply to them. Applicant\u2019s four violations of the ignition interlock \ndevice under SOR \u00b6 1.c, however, satisfy both AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) (a pattern of minor \noffenses) and AG \u00b6 31(b) (evidence of criminal conduct, regardless of charge, \nprosecution, or conviction). \nThe following mitigating conditions for criminal conduct are potentially applicable \nunder AG \u00b6 32: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not fully apply in mitigation of Applicant\u2019s criminal \nconduct for the same reasons as the alcohol consumption mitigating conditions are not \nfully applicable, as discussed above. Applicant\u2019s four ignition interlock violations raise \ndoubts about his compliance with rules and regulations, and he has not provided \nsufficient evidence of mitigation in the limited time since then. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. I also note that since Applicant \nelected a decision on the written record, I did not have the opportunity to observe his \ndemeanor or ask questions of him to assess his credibility and the strength of his case \nin mitigation. To mitigate the security concerns about his conduct, more time is needed, \nand Applicant needs to establish a demonstrated track record of compliance with rules \nand regulations, particularly with respect to alcohol consumption. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ninvolvement or criminal conduct security concerns.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 29 years old. He has worked for his current government-contractor\u00ad employer as a production planner since July 2017. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He is single with no children. (Item 3) The SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts totaling approximately $40,268. The debts are comprised of collections and delinquent accounts (11 student loans and 4 medical debts). The debts are established by Applicant\u2019s background interview in April 2020, his credit reports from March 2020 and March 2022, and his SOR admissions in his answer. The SOR also alleged that in his February 2020 security clearance application (SCA) he deliberately failed to disclose all the above-described delinquent debts. (Items 2, 4-6) Applicant explained his delinquent student loans by stating that his parents had agreed to pay them and he thought they were paying them since he did not receive notices of their delinquencies. His March 2020 credit report shows that all the delinquent student loans were assigned to collection agencies between 2010 and 2014. He has presented no documentation showing any efforts to contact the creditors or establish payment plans independent of his parent\u2019s efforts (which are not established in the record). He was unaware of the student-loan delinquencies ",

Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material on March 18, 2022. The evidence included in \nthe FORM is identified as Items 3-6 (Items 1 and 2 include pleadings and transmittal \ninformation). Applicant received and signed for the FORM on April 11, 2022. Applicant \nwas given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. He did neither. Items 3-6 are admitted into evidence without \nobjections. The case was assigned to me on June 16, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as \nfindings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. He has worked for his current government-contractor\u00ad\nemployer as a production planner since July 2017. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2016. He is single with no children. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts totaling approximately $40,268. The debts \nare comprised of collections and delinquent accounts (11 student loans and 4 medical \ndebts). The debts are established by Applicant\u2019s background interview in April 2020, his \ncredit reports from March 2020 and March 2022, and his SOR admissions in his \nanswer. The SOR also alleged that in his February 2020 security clearance application \n(SCA) he deliberately failed to disclose all the above-described delinquent debts. (Items \n2, 4-6) \nApplicant explained his delinquent student loans by stating that his parents had \nagreed to pay them and he thought they were paying them since he did not receive \nnotices of their delinquencies. His March 2020 credit report shows that all the delinquent \nstudent loans were assigned to collection agencies between 2010 and 2014. He has \npresented no documentation showing any efforts to contact the creditors or establish \npayment plans independent of his parent\u2019s efforts (which are not established in the \nrecord). He was unaware of the student-loan delinquencies at the time he completed his \nSCA. Applicant was also unaware of the delinquent medical accounts at the time he \ncompleted his SCA. During his background interview he acknowledged responsibility for \nthe four medical collections and indicated he would make arrangement to resolve the \ndebts. He failed to present documentation showing any action on his part. All the SOR \ndebts remain unresolved. There is no evidence of financial counseling. (Items 4-6) \nIn his background interview, Applicant claimed that his current financial condition \nwas good and that he was making contributions to a retirement plan. He failed to \npresent any corroborating documentation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid or unresolved. He has a history \nof unpaid debts. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of student loans \ndue to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan payments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing\u00ad\nstudent-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse previously delinquent student \nloans. (See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021)) \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. The SOR debts are ongoing and \ntherefore recent. Applicant claimed that his parents had agreed to pay his student loans, \nbut clearly they failed to do so. He acknowledged his joint responsibility for his student \nloans, but failed to provide evidence that he has taken action to remedy the \ndelinquencies. None of the SOR debts have been addressed and all remain delinquent. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant gave a plausible explanation for not knowing the status of his debts. \nSince the Government has the burden to establish that an Applicant deliberately gave \nfalse or misleading information on his SCA, I cannot conclude that it met its burden \nhere. Notwithstanding the fact that Applicant \u201cadmitted\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.a, AG \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While I conclude that the falsificaiotn \nallegation is not established, Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nstability. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 59 years old. He married in 1987, divorced in 1989, remarried in 1992, divorced in 2001, and remarried in 2008. He has four children--two adults and two minors. (Items 2, 3, 4) Applicant graduated from high school in 1982. He served in the U.S. military from 1983 to 1985, and was discharged under other than honorable conditions for testing positive for illegal drugs. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 and a master\u2019s degree in 2008. He worked for previous DOD contractors from January 2010 to March 2019 and September to November 2019. He was unemployed from November 2019 to January 2020. As of his February 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he worked as a program analyst for his employer, a DOD contractor, since January 2020. He was first granted a security clearance in 1983. (Items 3, 4, 7) The SOR alleged that Applicant had 13 delinquent student loans totaling $80,254 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - m) and a $150 delinquent consumer debt (SOR \u00b6 1.n). Applicant\u2019s April 2020 credit bureau report lists all of the SOR debts.

Applicant received the \nFORM on August 10, 2021, and he responded to it on August 27, 2021 (FORM \nResponse). The case was assigned to me on October 6, 2021. The Government\u2019s \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 7 are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 59 years old. He \nmarried in 1987, divorced in 1989, remarried in 1992, divorced in 2001, and remarried in \n2008. He has four children--two adults and two minors. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1982. He served in the U.S. military from \n1983 to 1985, and was discharged under other than honorable conditions for testing \npositive for illegal drugs. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 and a master\u2019s degree \nin 2008. He worked for previous DOD contractors from January 2010 to March 2019 \nand September to November 2019. He was unemployed from November 2019 to \nJanuary 2020. As of his February 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he worked \nas a program analyst for his employer, a DOD contractor, since January 2020. He was \nfirst granted a security clearance in 1983. (Items 3, 4, 7) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 13 delinquent student loans totaling $80,254 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - m) and a $150 delinquent consumer debt (SOR \u00b6 1.n). Applicant\u2019s April \n2020 credit bureau report lists all of the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s November 2020 credit \nbureau report lists the student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.h, and reflects that Applicant \npaid SOR \u00b6 1.n in July 2020. Applicant disclosed delinquent student loans totaling \n$20,000 on his 2020 SCA, and he also discussed his delinquent student loans during \nhis April 2020 background interview. In 2014, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy and his debts of approximately $10,000 were discharged. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, \n6) \nIn his SCA, interview with a background investigator, Answer, and FORM \nResponse, Applicant attributed his delinquent student loans to: (1) his three-month \nperiod of unemployment from November 2019 to January 2020, when he financially \nsupported himself through unemployment benefits; and (2) being the sole wage-earner \nsupporting his spouse and children, with an annual income of $51,000 to $78,000 from \napproximately 2017 to 2020, in a state with a high cost of living. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \nForm Response) \nApplicant indicated in his Answer, SCA, background interview, and Form \nResponse that his annual income increased to $93,000 in 2020 and then to $110,000 in \n2021. He stated that with his annual income increase, he stabilized his student loans \nthrough online credit counseling and financial budgeting. He stated that he was also \nactively seeking a second job to continue to resolve his financial difficulties.

His student loans with the U.S. Department of \nEducation, with a total balance of $23,099 as of June 2021, were in rehabilitation with a \nmonthly repayment amount of $397, and payments were deferred during the COVID-19 \npandemic. Applicant also provided documentation reflecting that he made payments \ntoward his delinquent student loans with KHEAA and Navient from 2020 to 2021, prior \nto receiving the SOR. (Items 2, 3, 4, Form Response) \nApplicant provided a copy of his budget with his Answer. He stated in his FORM \nResponse that he has diligently worked to improve his credit and he intends to continue \nto resolve his student loans and meet his financial obligations. (Items 2, 3, 4, Form \nResponse) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d apply. Applicant was unable to pay his student loans and \nconsumer debt. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant paid his \nconsumer debt and he provided documentation to corroborate his claims of payment \ntoward his delinquent student loans. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6 19(f) \napplies. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20 is potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant disclosed her failures to file income tax returns on her September 2017 \nSCA. She was candid about those failures during her November 20, 2018, PSI. On August \n30, 2021, Applicant, with the aid of a professional tax preparer, rectified those failures by \nfiling the tax returns alleged in the SOR. The SOR was issued on September 3, 2021, \njust days before Applicant remedied her tax defalcations. Because only nominal taxes or \nrefunds were due, Applicant was not engaging in tax avoidance. Rather, by her own \nadmissions, she procrastinated, was forgetful, and was poor at recording keeping. \nIt is a fair conclusion that the security clearance process motivated Applicant to \naddress her tax filing deficiencies. An applicant who waits until her security clearance is \nin peril to cure her tax filing deficiencies does not demonstrate the reliability necessary to \nhold a national security clearance. See ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, \n2017). \nIt is true that Applicant\u2019s failure to file income tax returns began several years ago. \nThat was, however, just the beginning of a pattern that continued until just days before \nthe issuance of the SOR. And it was the security clearance process that prompted \nApplicant to act, not any arrangements with taxing authorities. Applicant has now, \nbelatedly, cured her tax issues. Even so, the security risk from her conduct remains. \nApplicant has not established a track record of regular compliance with state and federal \ntax filing requirements. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (g) do not apply. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nAs part of my whole-person analysis, it is worth noting that Applicant\u2019s failures to \nfile state and federal income tax returns are the only blemishes on her financial record. \nHer other accounts are current. On this record, Applicant may very well benefit from \nfinancial counseling or a personal financial adviser to aid in keeping her tax filings in order. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013  1.c.:  \n        Against Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and \u00b6 2.a, and provided narrative explanations for each allegation. He denied using illegal drugs while possessing an active clearance, but he acknowledged using the illegal drugs during the timeframe alleged. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.e, also with an explanation.

He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and \u00b6 2.a, and provided \nnarrative explanations for each allegation.

He was married from October 2016 until January 2020, \nwhen he and his wife divorced. He has no children. Applicant graduated from high \nschool in 2007. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011 and a master\u2019s degree in 2012. \nFrom June 2012 until August 2014, he worked as an engineer for defense contractor 1. \nHe left that job for his current position with defense contractor 2, a job he has held since \nAugust 2014.

(Item 3 at 41-42) \nApplicant disclosed using LSD once and \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d a few times with friends, \nalso between August 2020 and December 2020. (Item 3 at 42) \nOn his SCA. Applicant described his use of each drug as experimental, and \ndriven by curiosity. He repeatedly stated that he had never used illegal drugs while in \npossession of a security clearance, and in answering the question \u201cWas your use while \npossessing a security clearance?\u201d in each instance Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d Applicant \nalso stated that he did not intend to use illegal drugs in the future due to the impact on \nhis clearance and his career. (Item 3 at 40-42) \nApplicant had a background interview in February 2021. He affirmed during the-\ninterview that he had not used illegal drugs since December 2020, as previously \ndisclosed. In August 2021, he authenticated and adopted his interview summary as \nvalid and accurate. When asked to detail his history of illegal drug use, he referred to \nhis previous disclosures and affirmed that \u201cno further instances have occurred.\u201d (Item 4) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s various instances of illegal drug use \n(marijuana, MDNA, cocaine and LSD) occurred with varying frequency, during the \ntimeframes listed above (with one exception noted below), \u201cwhile granted access to \nclassified information.\u201d (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, in June\n2009 and again from about July 2011 to at least November 2020, while granted access \nto classified information.\u201d (Emphasis added) Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s statement in \nanswering SOR \u00b6 1.a that he \u201cused marijuana during the time specified,\u201d there is no \nother evidence that he resumed marijuana use in \u201cJuly 2011.\u201d Rather, the record \notherwise supports a finding that he resumed marijuana use in January 2019. (Item 3 at \n40-41; Item 4 at 8) It therefore appears that the reference to \u201cJuly 2011\u201d in SOR \u00b6 1.a is \nerroneous, and likely a typographical error. I find accordingly and consider that he \nresumed using marijuana in January 2019.  \n \n \n \nAs noted, Applicant admitted using the illegal drugs in question but denied using \nany illegal drugs while in possession of a clearance. He reported having been granted a \nclearance while with defense contractor 1, in March 2012.

He noted that it would be \u201cvirtually impossible \nto associate only with people who do not use illegal drugs.\u201d (Answer) \nApplicant attested that his illegal drug use has ceased; he is not tempted to \npartake in illegal substances; he has been truthful about his prior drug use, which \ndemonstrates his honesty and his ability and willingness to comply with laws, rules and \nregulations, and thus, his eligibility for access to classified information. (Answer) \nApplicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM so no more recent information \nabout him is available. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, which I am required to follow, has cited the 2014 DNI \nMemo in holding that \u201cstate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited \ncircumstances do not pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the \nDepartment of Defense is not bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state \nlaw when adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016).  \nThe current National Security Adjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, \n2017, after 2014 DNI memo was issued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to apply. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo \nincorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) among \nvarious other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency.  \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (citing Guideline H, alleged in this case, \nand the AGs for personal conduct and criminal conduct, Guidelines E and J, not alleged \nhere). Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs indicate that \u201cdisregard of \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not determinative, to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a \nsensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \nApplicant has a history of using and experimenting with a variety of illegal drugs. \nThis includes marijuana, MDMA (ecstasy), cocaine and LSD, all as recently as \nNovember or December 2020. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies to all of Applicant\u2019s drug use, as all of \nthese drugs are illegal under federal law. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s illegal drug \nuse, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. \nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs \u201cwhile in possession of a security clearance,\u201d \nhowever, is not established. Applicant denied that portion of all of the allegations on the \nSOR. He repeatedly stated on his SCA, in his interview, and in his Answer, that he has \nnot used illegal or controlled substances while holding a clearance. His denials put the \nburden of proof on the Government to establish those claims. \nApplicant said in his SCA that he had been granted a secret clearance in March \n2012, while he was working with defense contractor 1. He left that job in August 2014, \nand has worked for defense contractor 2 ever since. Clearances do not \u201cexpire\u201d but they \ndo require sponsorship by an employer (either Governmental or private industry) who \nneeds the applicant to have access to classified information. The record does not \ncontain documentation from the Government\u2019s own records, such as the JPAS or DISS \ndatabase, that might have verified this. It is not established that Applicant used illegal \ndrugs \u201cwhile granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 25(f) is not established. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is also not established as disqualifying conduct. An applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdisassociation from drug using associates and contacts\u201d is a factor for consideration in \nmitigation. (See AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), discussed below) But an applicant\u2019s continued \nassociation with such contacts is not disqualifying under Guideline H. SOR \u00b6 1.e is \ntherefore found for Applicant, whether or not it is established in mitigation. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  \nAs the 2021 DNI memo notes, relevant mitigating factors under the AGs include, \nbut are not limited to, \nfrequency of use and whether the individual can demonstrate that future \nuse is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or other such \nappropriate mitigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing federal law \nand policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position \nor holding a security clearance, agencies are encouraged to advise \nprospective national security workforce employees that they should refrain \nfrom any future marijuana use upon initiation of the national security \nvetting process, which commences once the individual signs the \ncertification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions.\u201d  \nApplicant has used and experimented with a variety of illegal drugs in recent \nyears. His use includes not only marijuana or THC, but also MDMA/ecstasy, LSD, and \ncocaine. His use of MDMA was on multiple social occasions between September 2019 \nand November 2020, and his use of cocaine and LSD was on multiple social occasions \nbetween August 2020 and December 2020. He submitted his SCA only weeks later, in \nearly January 2021. \nApplicant asserts that his use of marijuana or THC is now legal in the state where \nhe lives. Applicant makes no such assertion as to MDMA/ecstasy, cocaine, or LSD, \nFurther, legality of Applicant\u2019s conduct under state law is not mitigating where his use of \nmarijuana, a Schedule 1 controlled substance, continues to violate Federal law. \nWith the exception of his marijuana use in 2009, all of Applicant\u2019s subsequent \nuse of illegal drugs came as a mature adult, in his early 30s. He was employed by a \ndefense contractor at the time (his current employer) whether or not he held a clearance \nat the time, or had actual access to classified information. Regardless, he should have \nknown better. Applicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use is too recent and too varied to \nprovide much evidence of mitigation. \nApplicant did not establish that his illegal drug use is infrequent, isolated, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He did not provide \nsufficient evidence to establish that he has disassociated from drug-using associates or \ncontacts, nor that he has changed the environment where drugs were used. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) and 26(b) do not apply.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is merely a cross-allegation of the drug involvement allegations in \nSOR \u00b6 1. The personal conduct general concern (AG \u00b6 15) is established given that \nApplicant\u2019s admitted conduct establishes his questionable judgment and his \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The Guideline E cross-allegation is \nlargely redundant and unnecessary, since all of the issues are addressed under \nGuideline H, above. Nevertheless, the resulting personal conduct security concerns are \nalso unmitigated for the same reasons as set forth under Guideline H. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not request a hearing, nor did he respond to the FORM, \nopportunities where he might have offered additional evidence, either in mitigation or at \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nleast explanation, either under the guidelines alleged or under the whole-person \nconcept. \nApplicant seeks a security clearance with the U.S. Department of Defense, and \nmarijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance under federal law, as do the other \ncontrolled substances he used as recently as late 2020, only weeks before submitting \nhis SCA. Applicant has not met his burden of showing that he has fully mitigated the \nsecurity concerns set forth by his illegal drug use. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 44 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He holds the position of Senior Systems Engineer II. He is seeking to retain his security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he has certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions that can impair his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. The SOR alleged that Applicant has been hospitalized on at least three separate occasions over the past ten years for symptoms related to Bi-Polar Disorder II and I. First, in August 2013; second, in May 2019; and third, sometime after his previous hospitalization, as the record contains no further detail. In March 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed DoD-approved psychologist, at which time it was determined that Applicant\u2019s mental health prognosis was poor, and that his psychiatric disorder could contribute to impairment in judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted the allegations set forth in the SOR under subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b., 1.c., and denied subparagraphs 1.d., and 1.e. with qualifications.

On June 29, 2021, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline I, Psychological Conditions. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865 (EO), Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 11, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 20, 2022. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on April 18, \n2022, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 20, 2022.

Applicant \ncalled five witnesses and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on August 1, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 44 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He holds the position of Senior Systems Engineer II. He is seeking \nto retain his security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nhas certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions that can impair his judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has been hospitalized on at least three separate \noccasions over the past ten years for symptoms related to Bi-Polar Disorder II and I. \nFirst, in August 2013; second, in May 2019; and third, sometime after his previous \nhospitalization, as the record contains no further detail. In March 2021, Applicant was \nevaluated by a licensed DoD-approved psychologist, at which time it was determined \nthat Applicant\u2019s mental health prognosis was poor, and that his psychiatric disorder \ncould contribute to impairment in judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant \nadmitted the allegations set forth in the SOR under subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b., 1.c., and \ndenied subparagraphs 1.d., and 1.e. with qualifications. Applicant began working for his \ncurrent employer in July 2001.  He was granted a security clearance in June 2004. \n1.a.  In August 2013, Applicant voluntarily admitted himself into the hospital for \ndepression, anxiety and suicidal ideation.  He reported being stressed at work, and had \nfeelings of being stuck in his position, work, and personal life.  Medical records disclose \nthat he felt hopeless and worthless, and had frequent passing thoughts of doing harm to \nhimself like using a knife, or lying in the middle of the street, or jumping off of a building, \nor driving off the side of the road, but he would push them out of his mind and suppress \nthem.  He also had problems sleeping.  He was prescribed different medications, \nincluding Wellbutrin, Depakote, Klonopin, and Restoril to help him sleep.  He spent \nseven days in the hospital.  Following this hospitalization, he was referred to an \nIntensive Outpatient Program for his mental health conditions, and was diagnosed with \nBi-polar Disorder II.  Sometime in 2014, Applicant discontinued all of his outpatient care \nservices, including therapy and medication, against medical advice.  He perceived that \nhe was no longer in need of treatment.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)  He stated that \nthe side effects of the medication caused him to gain 70 pounds of weight, and he saw \nlittle to no change in his mood or disposition.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)     \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.b.  From May 19, 2019, through June 5, 2019, Applicant was hospitalized for episodes \nof paranoid ideation and confusion.  Medical records reveal that Applicant was visiting \nNew York when he experienced an episode of paranoid ideation and confusion.  \nApplicant described being on a subway platform in Times Square when a young woman \nstanding with her back to the tracks, turning in his direction, on her phone texting, was \nlooking directly at him.  She continued starring at him, and it made him uncomfortable.  \nHe moved away from her, but she followed him.  This same situation happened again \nwith a second girl.  Applicant testified that he thought he could have been drugged, \nwithout knowing it, and he did not feel safe.  He wanted to get to the Brooklyn Bridge \nbut could not locate it.  He wandered the streets of New York for some time before he \ncame across a couple of police officers, who took him to the hospital.  Applicant was \nhospitalized for three weeks and treated for Bi-Polar II Disorder.  Applicant\u2019s treating \npsychiatrist reported that Applicant has a past diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder, and is \nrecovering from an episode of paranoid ideations and some other psychotic symptoms \nafter being stressed at work, not getting adequate amounts of sleep, and drinking \nexcessive amount of caffeine.  Upon his release, it was recommended that Applicant \nsee his mental health provider and follow up with his treatment.   \n1.c.  Not long after returning to his home state, Applicant was hospitalized again, due to \nearlier patterns of deterioration in functioning associated with his sleeplessness, stress \nand guilt.  As a result of this incident, Applicant started receiving outpatient psychiatric \nand psychotherapy services.  There is no further information about this hospital stay.  \n(Government Exhibit 3.)  Applicant stated that he needed this hospitalization because \nthe doctor had changed his medication, which exacerbated his sleeplessness, stress, \nand guilt and anxiety.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \n1.d.  Medical records reveal that in or around 2019, Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist documented \nApplicant\u2019s psychotic experiences included paranoid ideation, including the feeling of \nbeing watched, and that Applicant felt he was on \u201csome sort of mission\u201d, and was \n\u201chearing voices.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 3.)  Applicant testified that this did occur while he \nwas visiting New York.  He felt he was being watched, he heard voices from people \nspeaking in a foreign language, he was scared, and on a mission to find safety.  \nApplicant stated that there were no additional paranoid ideations or feelings of being \nwatched apart from this experience.  (Tr. pp.104-109.) \nApplicant stated that since June 2019, he has complied with and followed \nthrough with all of his recommended treatment and appointments that were laid out for \nhim by his providers. He has also followed the medication regime given to him by his \nphysicians. Applicant believes that his mental health has stabilized and has been on an \nupward trend as of December 2020. Applicant believes that much of his past problems \nhave been due to finding the right combination and dosage of medication to be \neffective. Applicant has also been working with his clinical psychotherapist to learn how \nto avoid stressors and other threats to his mental health and to proactively stabilize his \nlife and relationships. (Tr. pp. 128-133.) \nIn November 2020, Applicant took vacation in response to stressors at work and \ndifficulty coping. He then took an unpaid leave with permission of his department lead \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \nwho agreed that he should take time away from work. Applicant took a road trip and \nstated that he felt that it helped him to heal his mind and body. \n1.e.  In March 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed DoD approved psychologist. \nHer written report details the psychological history and current mental health condition \nof the Applicant.  She stated that during her evaluation of the Applicant, he reported that \nhis prescribed psychotherapy is infrequent and inconsistent, and that his therapy \nservices entail an estimation of seeing his therapist once every two or three months. \nShe determined that given Applicant\u2019s recent period of overwhelmed and heightened \nanxiety, which necessitated an extended vacation to regulate, Applicant is likely in need \nmore consistent psychotherapy services to ensure his stability.  (Government Exhibit 3.)   \nThe psychologist\u2019s evaluation of the Applicant further indicates that for \npsychotropic medication, Applicant is currently being prescribed Lithium and Lamictal, \nwhich he takes twice daily. He also takes Ativan for anxiety. Applicant is currently \ntaking this medication to help regulate his mood. The evaluation also indicates that \nApplicant\u2019s psychotic symptoms are still present, but have been improving since he was \nhospitalized at the hospital in New York and started on Haldol. She concluded that the \nApplicant continued to meet the criteria for Bipolar II Disorder, with anxious distress, \nand with mood-congruent psychotic features. \nDue to irregular engagement in \npsychotherapy, propensity to be overwhelmed in response to minor stressors, and \nrecent decompensation in functioning, Applicant\u2019s mental health prognosis is \nconsidered to be poor. \nShe believed his psychiatric disorder could contribute to \nimpairment in judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nFive witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant. Four of the witnesses were \nfriends, professional associates, or colleagues, of the Applicant. \nEach of these \nindividuals find the Applicant to be a man of integrity who is extremely reliable and \ntrustworthy.  They all recommend him for a security clearance. (Tr. pp. 26-98.) \nMedical records of the Applicant reveal that in 2020, he was diagnosed with a \nnumber of mental health issues.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist \ntestified and explained Applicant\u2019s Bi-Polar mental disorder as being one of the major \ndisorders in mental health.  (Tr. pp. 50-76.)  He testified from Applicant\u2019s medical \nrecords that on January 2, 2020, Applicant was diagnosed with Bi-Polar Disorder II, in \npartial remission.  On March 3, 2020, Applicant was diagnosed with Bi-Polar Disorder I, \ndepressed episodes, in partial remission.  The psychiatrist remembers a discussion with \nthe Applicant about his concerns with the side effects and dosages of the medication \nand Applicant\u2019s gastro-intestinal symptoms he suffered from taking the medication.  (Tr. \np. 59.)  Two days before the hearing, he diagnosed Applicant with Bi-polar Disorder I, \ndepressed episode, in full remission.  (Tr. p. 60.)  He further testified that he does \nbelieve that Applicant has a condition that could impair his judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.  (Tr. pp. 62 and 63.)  If not controlled, his Bi-Polar Condition could \ncause problems.  (Tr. P. 63.)  He also stated that Applicant has had no symptoms for \nseveral months.  (Tr. p. 65.)  In his opinion, if Applicant continues his treatment and \ncompliance with prescribed medications, as well as support through family, friends, and \nprofessionals, his diagnosis should remain stable.

The \npsychotherapist has seen the Applicant for more than three months in one-hour weekly \npsychotherapy sessions since March 2022. In his opinion, Applicant has for decades \nhas been trying to find adequate ways for coping with a severely dysfunctional family \nsystem, which he only recently started to manage properly. Based upon his clinical \nobservation, the medication that Applicant is currently taking for his Bipolar II mood \ndisorder is totally managing his condition. \nHowever, Applicant must regularly and \nconsistently take this medication. In his opinion, Applicant\u2019s prognosis was excellent, \nand he has no concerns regarding any perceived concern that could impair Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. The therapist states that Applicant is a highly \nfunctional, holistically healthy, fully capable individual who can confidently carry on his \nusual job demands, the way he faithfully has done for so many years. He recommends \nthat Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information be continued. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit E.) \nLetters of recommendation from colleagues, friends, and family of the Applicant \nattest to his reliability and trustworthiness. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, \nand O.)  \nPerformance Development Summaries of the Applicant for the periods from 2012 \nthrough 2021 reflect that he is meeting job expectations. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nApplicant has received a number of awards and commendations for his \nperformance on the job.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability or \ntrustworthiness: and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis of Bi-Polar Disorder, whether I or II, spans over a ten-year \nhistory, and includes a number of episodes as early as 2013, and as recently as 2021. \nHis symptoms ranged from major depressive episodes, psychotic and paranoid \nideation, confusion, anxiety, sleeplessness, guilt, among others. Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth condition has been unstable and unregulated for some time, and has only \nrecently, within the last six months, at most, shown some stability. \nHis irregular \nengagement in psychotherapy has not been helpful. His condition may impair his \njudgment, stability or trustworthiness.

Overall, there is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the \nApplicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government \nsecurity concerns under Guideline I. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant\u2019s mental health condition can continue to improve and show a long-term \npositive prognosis, without incident, he may at some point be found to be sufficiently \nreliable to properly protect and access classified information, but not at this time. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Psychological Conditions security concern. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.e. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

The July 2021 SOR alleges under paragraph 1.a that Applicant used marijuana at varying frequency between June 2000 and June 2020. In his July 2021 answer, he admitted the allegation, but noted there were breaks in usage and the total number of marijuana uses was in the \u201clow single digits.\u201d He indicated that other than his marijuana use, he never violated federal law in any way. The use of marijuana never felt comfortable, and he had no desire to use the drug in the future.

After examining the background \ninvestigation, the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) could not make \nthe affirmative findings necessary to issue a security clearance. On June 25, 2021, \nDSCA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder drug involvement and substance misuse (Guideline H), and personal conduct \n(Guideline E). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), made \neffective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided an answer to the SOR on July 8, 2021. This case was \noriginally assigned to another administrative judge on January 20, 2022. A notice of \nhearing was issued to Applicant on March 7, 2022 by the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) scheduling a hearing for April 22, 2022. The case was then \nreassigned to me for administrative reasons and the hearing was held on the scheduled \ndate. The Government\u2019s four exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant did not seek admission of any exhibits into evidence. He did testify. On May 5, \n2022, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.); the record closed the same day. \nThe discovery letter, dated August 5, 2021, is marked as hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. \nFindings of Fact \nBased on the testimony and record evidence presented at the hearing, I make \nthe following findings of fact. The July 2021 SOR alleges under paragraph 1.a that \nApplicant used marijuana at varying frequency between June 2000 and June 2020. In \nhis July 2021 answer, he admitted the allegation, but noted there were breaks in usage \nand the total number of marijuana uses was in the \u201clow single digits.\u201d He indicated that \nother than his marijuana use, he never violated federal law in any way. The use of \nmarijuana never felt comfortable, and he had no desire to use the drug in the future. \n(July 2021 answer to SOR) \nThe SOR alleges under paragraph 1.b that Applicant used marijuana after he \nwas granted access to classified information on March 21, 2006, and on February 10, \n2016. Applicant admitted paragraph 1.b, but presented no additional comment to \nexplain his admission. \nParagraph 2.a of the SOR alleges that Applicant provided false information on \nhis September 2015 e-QIP by answering \u201cNo\u201d to the Section 23 question of illegal drug \nuse in the last 7 years, and by answering \u201cNo\u201d to illegal drug use while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant admitted providing false information, but claimed it \nresulted from misunderstanding the seven-year question. He remembered telling the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he had used marijuana \npreviously, but not in the last seven years. The investigator told him not to worry about \nhis use. Applicant still believed the seven-year period applied to the second question \n(illegal use of drugs with a security clearance), even though \u201cit (the security question) \nclearly included the word \u201cEVER,\u201d referring to any past use. Applicant acknowledged \nillegal drug use, but contended that it took place outside the previous seven years. (July \n2021 answer to SOR) \nParagraph 2.b of the SOR alleges that in his August 2005 security clearance \napplication (SCA), Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 27 asking whether he used \nillegal drugs since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years.

In August 2005, he \nrecalled using marijuana once in his life, but he was unsure when. Because he only \nremembered a single use many years ago, he determined it was outside the previous \nseven years. Upon current reconsideration of when he last used marijuana, his best \nestimate was that the use occurred in the middle of 2000. Applicant emphasized that he \nnever intentionally furnished false information on a security clearance application. (July \n2021 answer to SOR) \nApplicant is 46 years old. From 1994 to 1997, he earned three years of college \ncredits but no degree. From 1997 to 1999, he received additional college credits at two \nother colleges but no degree. (GE 2 at 9, Tr. 13, 16) He has been married since \nSeptember 2010 and has two minor children, an 11-year-old daughter and a seven-\nyear-old son. Since 1997, he has been employed by a defense contractor as an \nestimator. Applicant was granted a security clearance in March 2006, June 2010, and \nFebruary 2016. He has owned his home since April 2011. (GE 1 at 9-18, 33) \nThe allegation of marijuana use set forth in SOR 1.a is based on Applicant\u2019s \nFebruary 2021 e-QIP where he admitted that he used marijuana from June 2000 to \nJune 2020. He described the frequency of use as approximately every couple of years. \nHe indicated that he used marijuana while he held a security clearance. He did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future. Applicant commented that \u201c[marijuana] doesn\u2019t do \nmuch for me. Every couple of years or so I think it might be better and I try it again. But \nit\u2019s always the same, just don\u2019t\u2019 see the point.\u201d (GE 1 at 31) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions about illegal marijuana use and use while holding a \nsecurity clearance in his February 2021 e-QIP contradict his negative responses in his \nSeptember 2015 e-QIP to using illegal drugs in the last seven (7) years, and never \nusing drugs while possessing a security clearance. (SOR 2.a) (GE 2 at 30) Applicant\u2019s \nFebruary 2021 drug admissions are also inconsistent with his negative response to \nQuestion 27 of his August 2005 e-QIP requiring disclosure of information of illegal drug \nuse since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years. (SOR 2.b) (GE 3 at 4) \nAt the April 2022 hearing, Applicant was questioned further about his history of \nmarijuana use. He claimed that he used the drug no more than four times in his lifetime, \nwhich is less than half as many times as he disclosed in his February 2021 e-QIP. (Tr. \n11-12) \nApplicant testified that his first use of marijuana occurred after returning from \ncollege in 1997. Then he testified the first use may have occurred between 1997 and \n1999. Then he testified he could not remember when the first use took place. \nNotwithstanding his inability to recall when he began using marijuana, he indicated that \nhe used the drug with a group of friends at someone\u2019s house after a holiday party.

He accepted someone\u2019s offer of the drug. He claimed the \neffect of his second use was just as unimpressive as his first use. (Tr. 18) \nIn 2007 or 2008, Applicant\u2019s third use of marijuana occurred at his parents\u2019 \nsummer house in a state where marijuana had been recently legalized. His parents had \nobtained a chocolate edible mixed with marijuana from a dispensary. Having been \ngranted his security clearance in March 2006, Applicant knew that his marijuana use \nwas inconsistent with his federal security clearance responsibilities. Applicant compared \nthe edible to \u201cchewing a stick\u201d and has not used marijuana in edible form since. He \ndecided to use the drug because, as noted earlier, the state had recently legalized the \ndrug, and he was not really thinking about his security clearance responsibilities at the \ntime he used the drug. (Tr. 18-19, 23-24) \nAfter a social event with neighbors in June 2020, Applicant and his wife \nreturned home. She pulled out a vape pen that she said she had received from a friend \nin high school. She had occasionally used marijuana in Applicant\u2019s presence in the past, \nbut this was the first time he used the drug with her. He was at home engaging in an \nexperimental method of using the drug, and was not thinking about his security \nclearance at the time. Because he could not taste the flavor the pen produced, he \ndecided that he did not like it. Applicant testified that his security clearance is not at the \n\u201cforefront of most things I do on a daily basis.\u201d He periodically thinks about his security \nclearance at work, but otherwise he does not think about the clearance regularly. (Tr. \n19-20, 26-28) \nApplicant was asked about the scope and frequency of his marijuana use \nbetween June 2000 and June 2020. He read the relevant portion of his February 2021 \ne-QIP describing his use of marijuana about every two years over the twenty-year \nperiod. Applicant disagreed with his statements by indicating he should have taken \nmore time and explained that his use was about four times over a period of 20 years. \nSubsequently, he stated that he described his marijuana use inadequately in that he \nbelieved his reply appearing in the e-QIP was focused on the overall number of years. \nTherefore, in Applicant\u2019s opinion, he only used marijuana twice between June 2000 and \nJune 2020. He was not really considering his lifetime total marijuana usage. The June \n2000 date was an estimate as to when he began marijuana use. He believed the \nbeginning use was closer to 1997. Although he testified earlier in the hearing that he \nused marijuana twice between 1997 and 1999, once in 2007 or 2008, and once in June \n2020, he did not disclose that use in his February 2021 e-QIP because of \u201cpoor \nwording,\u201d \u201caveraging it out,\u201d over the period rather that stating the number of times he \nused the drug. No additional clarifying information was provided. (GE 1 at 31; Tr. 28-30, \n34-35) \nApplicant testified that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. \nHowever, he was unable to state that he would not use the drug after he retires to a \nstate with warmer weather. Given that he has not been awed by his use of the drug four \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntimes in the past, he did not see a need to use the drug in the future. Even though his \nsecurity clearance is a growing factor in not using marijuana, the primary factor still is \nthat he does not like marijuana. (Tr. 30-31) \nAlthough Applicant unequivocally stated in his February 2021 e-QIP that he \nused marijuana approximately every two years between June 2000 and June 2020, he \ntestified that he only used the drug twice during the period. Though he admitted \nfalsifying the two questions on his 2015 e-QIP concerning drug use, and using drugs \nwhile possessing a security clearance, he claimed the negative answers resulted from \nmisunderstanding the questions asked, rather than deliberately falsifying his answers. \nThough he admitted falsifying the drug use question in his 2005 e-QIP, his negative \nanswer was the result of a miscalculation, and not deliberately falsifying his answer. He \nwas unsure when his last use of the drug occurred. In light of Applicant\u2019s five years of a \ncollege education, his employment with a defense contractor for about 24 years, his \npossession of a security clearance for at least 14 years, his knowledge that marijuana \nuse is illegal at the federal level and inconsistent with holding a security clearance, I do \nnot consider his discrepant and ambiguous accounts of his drug history and the \nexplanations for his falsifications to be credible. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 12564 signed by the then-President of the United States on September 15, \n1986. The primary issues addressed in the E.O. are: (1) federal employees cannot use \nillegal drugs; (2) illegal drug use by federal employees, on or off duty, is contrary to the \nefficiency of the service; and (3) persons who use illegal drugs may not be suitable for \nfederal employment. I have also taken administrative notice of a memorandum issued \nby the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) In October 2014, advising that no state can \nauthorize violations of federal law regarding the use of marijuana, a Schedule 1 \ncontrolled drug under the Controlled Substances Act. Changes in state law concerning \nthe use of marijuana do not alter national security guidelines. Lastly, the 2014 \nmemorandum indicates that \u201can individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to use, \nsale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security \ndeterminations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug user while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s use from June 2000 to June 2020, at a frequency of about every \ntwo years, falls within the scope of AG \u00b6 25(a). His use of the drug involved illegal \npossession of a controlled substance as defined by AG \u00b6 25(c). His possession and use \nof the drug after being granted access to classified information in March 2006, comes \nwithin the purview of AG \u00b6 25(f). \nAG \u00b6 26.

These inconsistencies, coupled with his continued marijuana use after \nhe had been granted a security clearance in February 2016, have a negative impact on \nthe credibility of his claim that he has not used marijuana since June 2020. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct raises ongoing security concerns concerning his judgment and reliability. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. \nThough Applicant denied that he will use marijuana in the future, he did not \nprovide a signed statement of intent acknowledging that any future drug involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of his security clearance eligibility. There is no evidence that he \nhas severed his relationships with drug-using individuals or has made positive changes \nin his environment and lifestyle that facilitates abstinence from future drug use. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns related to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.

Applicant denies that his \nfalsification of his 2005 e-QIP was intentional, but resulted from a miscalculation of \nwhen he last used marijuana. To determine whether the falsification was intentional or \nunintentional, the applicant\u2019s statement of mind is an important consideration along with \nhis age, education, and professional background. See, ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov.17,2004); ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010) In view of \nApplicant\u2019s age, education, and the long period in which he has held a security \nclearance, I do not find his misunderstanding and miscalculation explanations to be \ncredible. The evidence satisfactorily supports AG \u00b6 16(a). \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant did not make prompt good-faith efforts to correct his 2015 and 2005 \ne-QIP falsifications. His misunderstanding and miscalculation explanations are not \ncredible. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Deliberately providing false information to the \nGovernment cannot be considered minor and reflect negatively on his trustworthiness \nand judgment.

I have considered that Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a \ndefense contractor that he has worked for since 1997. He married in 2010 and has two \nchildren. \nOn the other hand, given Applicant\u2019s periodic use of marijuana between 2000 \nand 2020, his use of the drug knowing that it was illegal at the federal level, his \nmarijuana usage while possessing a security clearance since after March 2006, and the \ninconsistencies and ambiguities he supplied when explaining his history of marijuana \nuse, Applicant has not overcome the security concerns that remain under the drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. at 23-34, 36-37, 50-52.) \nApplicant borrowed the funds to pay for his medical school tuition, which was \napproximately $178,000 (see below). These student loans were part of a special \nprogram for individuals who held citizenship in both the United States and Country A. \nDual citizens like Applicant paid a higher tuition than those students who were only \ncitizens of Country A. After completing his education, he was required to perform one \nyear of \u201csocial service\u201d in a small village in Country A. He was paid the equivalent of \nabout $45 per month. In his e-QIP, he wrote that he worked as an intern in Country A \nuntil March 2014. He was actually unemployed from January 2013 to March 2014.

He wants to review his borrowing history with his foreign university to have a better \nunderstanding of his indebtedness. He has very little information about any of his debts. \n(Tr. at 26, 42-43, 46.) \nAccording to the record evidence, the current status of the debts listed in the SOR \nis as follows: \n1.a through 1.d. Student loans in collection totaling approximately $111,000. \nThese four loans were for the tuition expenses for the first four semesters of Applicant\u2019s \nmedical school education. They were private loans through a U.S. bank. In 2011 or \n2012, the loans became due for repayment, and the creditor started garnishing his \npaycheck in the amount of about $70 per month. He requested that the payments cease \nbecause he could not afford them. He testified that three or four years ago he called the \ncreditor and explained his financial situation. The creditor decided not to try to seek \nrepayment at that time. Since then he has been unable to make any payments on these \nloans. They are not presently in deferment or rehabilitation status, and they have been \nplaced for collection. GE 4 reflects that the original amounts of these loans totaled \napproximately $79,000. The amounts of the debts have increased due to interest over a \nperiod of about ten years. These debts are not resolved. (Tr. at 37-41; GE 3 at 4-5; GE 4 \nat 1-2; GE 5 at 2-3; GE 6 at 7-8.) \n1.e. Credit-card account in collection in the approximate amount of $1,926. \nApplicant opened this account to purchase a cell phone. He recalls paying on the \naccount but was subsequently unable to continue the payments. The creditor referred \nthe account to a collection agency. This collection account is for the same credit-card \ndebt as the one listed in SOR 1.m, below. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 41-42; GE 3 \nat 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 8.) \n1.f through 1.i. Student loans in collection totaling approximately $63,000. These \nfour loans are Direct Loans made by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). Applicant \nhas never been able to make any payments on these loans. He has never applied to \nDOE for a deferment or forbearance. He has also never sought to enter into an income-\nbased repayment or a loan-rehabilitation plan. The loans have been placed for collection. \nGE 4 reflects that the original amounts of these loans totaled approximately $41,000. \nThese debts are not resolved. (Tr. at 42-64; GE 4 at 3-4; GE 5 at 2-3; GE 6 at 8-9.) \n1.j and 1.k. Student loans in collection totaling approximately $33,000. These two \nstudent loans were granted under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL), \nwhich were private loans subsidized and guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Applicant \nhas been unable to make any payments on these loans. He has never applied for a \ndeferment or forbearance. He has also never sought to enter into an income-based \nrepayment or a loan-rehabilitation plan. The loans have been placed in collection.

This loan \nwas a private loan through the same U.S. bank that provided Applicant with the loans \ndiscussed in 1.a though 1.d, above. The credit reports in the record reflect that the \n$41,000 amount is the original amount of this loan. The record contains no information \nregarding the current amount due on this loan. Applicant has been unable to make any \npayments on this loan, and the loan has been assigned to the U.S. Government as the \nguarantor of the loan. This debt is not resolved. (Tr.at 46-48; GE 4 at 6; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 \nat 6.) \n1.m. Credit-card account charged off in the approximate amount of $1,343. \nApplicant opened this account in January 2015, and he defaulted on paying it in \nDecember 2016. The creditor charged off this account and assigned it to a collection \nagency. Applicant believes this is the same account as the one listed in SOR 1.e, above. \nThe record evidence confirms that the two accounts are for the same debt. The debt \namount of $1,343 is the original charged-off amount. The amount alleged in SOR 1.e \n($1,926) is the more recent amount Applicant owes to the collection agency. (Tr. at 42, \n47; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 5; GE 5 at 4.) \nBased upon the information available in Applicant\u2019s credit reports in the record \nsummarized above, Applicant borrowed about $178,000 for his medical school education \nduring the period 2005 to 2011. With ten years of accrued interest, the current total \namount of his student loans is about $248,000. Applicant has received no financial \ncounseling and has no plan except to investigate the current amounts of the debts he is \nadvised that he actually owes. At this point he cannot afford to repay these debts. He \nsummarized his position on his student loans, stating: \u201cas I see right now it\u2019s going to \ntake me forever to repay these back. But I have to do it.\u201d (Tr. at 48-49.) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance, or, as here, to \na determination of public trust. As the Supreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \n[and trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsensitive information.

ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise financial trustworthiness concerns. \nThe following are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record evidence reflects that Applicant borrowed about $178,000 in student \nloans. When he completed his foreign medical school education, he lacked the financial \nmeans to repay the loans. Now that the loans have been unpaid for over ten years, the \ntotal amount of Applicant\u2019s student loan debts exceeds $248,000. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand the record evidence regarding his unresolved student loans and credit-card debt \n(SOR 1.e, duplicated in SOR 1.m) support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to establish mitigation of the \nsecurity concerns raised by his financial history and current circumstances. \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes potentially applicable \nmitigating conditions, under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s student loans were \ngranted to him 11 to 17 years go and his defaults on loans occurred many years ago as \nwell. His debts, however, remain unpaid at this time and cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Since his graduation from medical school in \n2011, Applicant has been chronically underemployed or unemployed. He obtained a \ngood job over two year ago, but has not initiated any steps to rehabilitate any of his \nstudent loans so that he could enter into a good-faith effort to begin paying them or his \ncredit-card debt pursuant to appropriate payment plans. He has not acted responsibly \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunder the circumstances, and his behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nF in my whole-person analysis. Some further comments are warranted. Applicant began \nan expensive medical school education in Country A, which he paid for over a six-year \nperiod with borrowed money. He had no realistic plan as to how he would repay these \nloans and has not acted responsibly since graduation to develop a plan to repay them. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nsensitive information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s parents and her siblings (three sisters and three brothers) are resident citizens of Iran (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that her three brothers had served in the Iranian Army (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant admitted the allegations, but explained that her brothers were conscripted into mandatory military service in Iran some 18, 15, and 10 years ago, respectively. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. 2 Applicant is a 41-year-old dual citizen of her native Iran and of the United States since her naturalization in September 2017. She renewed her Iranian passport in June 2017 for another five years. In September 2017, she obtained her U.S. passport. She has never married and has no children. She has been in a cohabitant relationship with an Iranian citizen since July 2016. Her cohabitant, who has U.S. permanent residency status valid to July 2028, plans on applying for U.S. citizenship when he is eligible in 2023. (GE 1; Tr. 39-40.) Applicant earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in Iran in July 2002. After two years of study at an Iranian university of science and technology, she earned her master\u2019s degree in December 2004. (GE 1.) Applicant did not have to pay for her education. Top-tier Iranian universities are free to individuals who meet the academic entry standards tested by examination. (Tr. 29-30.)

The DCSA CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 28, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn February 8, 2022, Department Counsel indicated the Government was ready to \nproceed to a hearing. On February 24, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on March 1, 2022. \nAfter some coordination with the parties, on April 8, 2022, I scheduled a video \nteleconference hearing to be held via Microsoft Teams on May 10, 2022. At the hearing, \ntwo Government exhibits (GE 1-2) and two Applicant exhibits (AE A-B) were admitted in \nevidence without any objections. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on May 19, 2022. \nThe Government submitted a February 8, 2022 request for administrative notice \nconcerning the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran), which I marked as a hearing exhibit. (HE 1). \nThe request for administrative notice was based on seven publications or issuances from \nthe U.S. State Department; an April 9, 2021 threat assessment from the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence; a March 5, 2021 White House briefing; a November 5, \n2018 press release from the U.S. Treasury Department; three reports from the U.S. Justice \nDepartment of criminal activity aiding Iran; Executive Order 13846, dated August 6, 2018; \nand laws and issuances from the U.S. Homeland Security Department and the U.S. \nCustoms and Border Patrol regarding the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. Applicant confirmed \nthat she received the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice with extracts of the \nsource documents, and she had no objection to any of the facts proposed for \nadministrative notice. She declined an opportunity to propose administrative facts of her \nown concerning Iran and its relationship with the United States. \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties of my intention to take administrative notice of the \nfacts requested by the Government with respect to Iran, subject to the reliability of the \nsource documentation and the relevance and materiality of the facts proposed. \nAdditionally, I informed the parties of my intention to review for administrative notice \npurposes the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2021 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: \nIran, which was issued on April 12, 2022. The most salient facts administratively noticed \nare set forth in the factual findings below. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s parents and her siblings (three sisters and three \nbrothers) are resident citizens of Iran (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that her three brothers had served in \nthe Iranian Army (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant admitted the allegations, but explained that her \nbrothers were conscripted into mandatory military service in Iran some 18, 15, and 10 \nyears ago, respectively.

She renewed her Iranian passport in June \n2017 for another five years. In September 2017, she obtained her U.S. passport. She has \nnever married and has no children. She has been in a cohabitant relationship with an \nIranian citizen since July 2016. Her cohabitant, who has U.S. permanent residency status \nvalid to July 2028, plans on applying for U.S. citizenship when he is eligible in 2023. (GE 1; \nTr. 39-40.) \nApplicant earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in Iran in July 2002. After two years of study \nat an Iranian university of science and technology, she earned her master\u2019s degree in \nDecember 2004. (GE 1.) Applicant did not have to pay for her education. Top-tier Iranian \nuniversities are free to individuals who meet the academic entry standards tested by \nexamination. (Tr. 29-30.) \nApplicant applied to pursue a doctorate degree in Canada and the United States. \nShe received an offer of admission from a university in Canada first, but funding for her \ndoctorate was delayed a semester. Applicant accepted an offer of admission, which \nincluded funding, to a doctorate program at a private university in the United States. After \ntraveling to Cyprus in the summer of 2006 for a visa, she came to the United States in \nSeptember 2006. She obtained her academic documentation from the Iranian university, \nwhich she needed for her student visa for the United States. To her knowledge, she had no \nobligation to inform the Iranian government of her intention to study in the United States, \nand she did not do so. (Tr. 30-32.) At the time, she intended to earn her doctorate degree, \n\u201cexplore the world and see, maybe get back to [her] family.\u201d (Tr. 49.) After a couple of \nyears, with the situation in Iran worsening, she decided to remain in the United States and \nbring her family to the United States. (Tr. 49.) \nIn September 2010, Applicant earned her doctorate degree in the field of \nelectromagnetics. (GE 1.) After about three months as a post-doctorate research fellow, \nApplicant volunteered with her research team at the U.S. university from December 2010 to \nApril 2011. She then worked as a senior systems engineer for a U.S. company from June \n2011 to June 2013, when she was laid off. After several months of unemployment, she \nrelocated in February 2014 for a job as a principal scientist with a large U.S. energy \ncompany. In June 2016, she resigned from that employment and returned to her previous \nlocale for a new job as a system engineer in the U.S. office of a French company. In June \n2019, she commenced her present employment as a senior member of the technical staff \nfor a laboratory that contracts with the DOD. (GE 1.) The laboratory hired Applicant \nknowing that she holds dual citizenship. (Tr. 33.) \nSeeking her first DOD security clearance, Applicant completed and certified as \naccurate a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May 28, 2019. She \ndisclosed her dual citizenship; her possession of U.S. and Iranian passports; her use of her \nIranian passport to enter Iran to see family members annually from 2012 to 2017; her \ncohabitation with an Iranian citizen; her foreign travel, including that she had an upcoming \ntrip to Iran in June 2019 to see her family before starting her new job; her bank accounts in \nIran, which she closed in 2008; and her voting in Iran\u2019s 2017 presidential election before \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRelation \n \nOccupation \nFrequency and means of \nContact \nFather, age 83 \nRetired; was \n \na teacher in Weekly by telephone \n \nIran \nMother, age 68 \nNever \n \nworked outside \n \nthe Weekly by telephone \n \nhome \nSister 1, \n \nage 52; married; Educator, \n \nhigh \nschool \n \nMonthly \n \nby \n \ntelephone \n \nand \n \none daughter \nprincipal in Iran; \n \nspouse electronic means \nworks as manager at a \n \nprivate telecommunications \n \ncompany \nher U.S. naturalization. She listed her parents\u2019 and siblings\u2019 Iranian residency and \ncitizenship; her siblings\u2019 employers in Iran; and the frequency of her contacts with her \nfamily members in Iran. In response to an SF 86 inquiry concerning any sponsorship of a \nforeign national in the last seven years, she commented that she wanted to sponsor her \nparents and siblings for U.S. permanent residency in the future. (GE 1.) \nOn July 10, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant indicated that she was willing to \nrenounce her Iranian citizenship if required, but that she did not think it possible because \n\u201conce born in Iran you are always a citizen of Iran.\u201d Applicant\u2019s current U.S. passport (valid \nto September 28, 2029), current Iranian passport (valid to June 26, 2022), and two \nprevious Iranian passports were reviewed. Her current Iranian passport reflected trips to \nIran from March 31, 2018 to April 18, 2018; December 14, 2018 to January 1, 2019, which \nwas with her cohabitant (Tr. 37-38); and June 3, 2019 to June 20, 2019. Applicant \nexplained that she had to renew her Iranian passport to travel to Iran to see her family, and \nso she intends to continue renewing her Iranian passport. About her relatives in Iran, \nApplicant clarified that her three brothers had served 18 months of mandatory service in \nIran\u2019s Army but are no longer affiliated with a foreign government, military, security, \ndefense, or intelligence service. She had not experienced any requests for information or \nthreats from a foreign entity and had no issues when traveling to Iran. She volunteered that \nshe had voted in an Iranian election in June 2013, which she had forgotten about when she \ncompleted her SF 86. (GE 2.) \nOn August 1, 2019, Applicant was contacted by telephone for additional information, \nincluding about the nature of her relationship with her cohabitant; her contacts with her \nfamily members in Iran; and her reason for voting in Iran\u2019s election in 2017. Applicant \ndescribed her relations with her foreign cohabitant as a domestic partnership, and she \nindicated that she had informed her employer of this relationship. She explained that she is \nvery close to her parents and siblings in Iran. She contacted her parents weekly and her \nsiblings monthly to quarterly. She had notified her employer\u2019s security department about \nher foreign contacts. (GE 2.) \nSalient details about Applicant\u2019s relatives in Iran, as disclosed on her SF 86 (GE 1) \nand during her hearing (Tr. 25-27, 40-48, 50-55), are reflected in the following table. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSister 2, age 48; single \nProfessor at a public teacher \ntraining university in Iran \nQuarterly by telephone and \nelectronic means \nSister 3, age 45; married; \none son age 7 \nPhysician at a public Iranian \nhospital; spouse physician \nfor a couple of hospitals \nQuarterly by telephone and \nelectronic means \nBrother 1, age 44; married ; Electrical engineer for a Quarterly by telephone and \ntwo daughters ages 5 and 9 private telecommunications \nfirm in Iran; completed 18 \nmonths \nof \nmandatory \nmilitary service for Iran 18 \nyears ago; spouse does not \nwork outside the home \nelectronic means \nBrother 2, age 39; single \nEnglish \nteacher \nat \na \nlanguage school in Iran; \ncurrently \npursuing \nhis \nmaster\u2019s \ndegree \nin \nengineering \nin \nIran; \ncompleted 18 months of \nmandatory military service \nfor Iran 15 years ago \nMonthly by telephone and \nelectronic means \nBrother 3, age 34; married; \nno children \nComputer engineer at a \npublic medical clinic in Iran; \ncompleted 18 months of \nmandatory military service \nfor Iran 10 years ago; \nspouse runs a private high \nschool \nQuarterly by telephone and \nelectronic means \nIn 2019, Applicant sponsored her parents and siblings to immigrate to the United \nStates. (Tr. 25.) The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) received their \npetitions on December 28, 2019. (AE A.) On May 11, 2020, the USCIS approved Brother \n2\u2019s petition. Her father\u2019s petition was approved on November 30, 2020. (AE B.) Applicant is \nawaiting notification from U.S. visa processing authorities as to when she can submit the \nnecessary paperwork for Brother 2\u2019s visa. (Tr. 25-26.) The process of review for her \nrelatives was delayed because of COVID-19, but her mother\u2019s petition is under active \nreview. (Tr. 26.) If her mother is approved for immigration within the next few months, \nApplicant plans to apply for visas for her parents to come to the United States together. (Tr. \n26, 48.) If she does not obtain approval for her mother\u2019s immigration by that time, Applicant \nplans to apply for a visa for her father to come alone because of his elderly age. (Tr. 49.) \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant\u2019s immediate family (mother and one brother) are U.S. \nresident citizens. He has extended family in Iran, and they live in the same city as Sister 2. \nApplicant went directly to see her parents and had no contact with any of her cohabitant\u2019s \nfamily when they traveled together to Iran in December 2018.

(Tr. 28.) \nWith the exception of Sister 2, her siblings as well as her parents live in the same city in \nIran. (GE 1.) Applicant usually travels annually to her hometown in Iran to see her \nimmediate family, including Sister 2 who comes from her city in Iran so they can all be \ntogether. (Tr. 34.) Applicant has not been asked any unusual questions by Iranian officials \non her entry, during her stay, or on her exit from Iran. (Tr. 34.) Applicant traveled to Iran in \nOctober 2020, when her mother was ill with COVID-19, and most recently in August 2021, \nwhen her father was seriously ill with COVID-19. He was hospitalized in an intensive care \nunit for three weeks. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant notified her employer of her trips prior to \ndeparting and was interviewed about her trips by security personnel at work on her return. \nShe uses her U.S. passport whenever she enters or exits the United States. She uses her \nIranian passport to enter and exit Iran. She uses her U.S. passport when traveling to \ncountries other than Iran. (Tr. 35.) As to whether she intends to renew her Iranian passport, \nwhich is scheduled to expire in June 2022, Applicant testified at her hearing, \u201cI guess so.\u201d \nShe further testified that she could travel to Iran on her U.S. passport but it would not be \neasy to get a visa. Additionally, she testified that, instead of traveling to Iran, she might \nmeet her family in Turkey. She would not need a visa on her Iranian passport but she \nwould need a visa on her U.S. passport to enter Turkey. (Tr. 55-57.) \nApplicant considers herself to be an American. She has no ties to Iran apart from \nher family. (Tr. 26.) Applicant purchased her first home in the United States in September \n2016. (GE 1.) She and her cohabitant purchased their current residence in January 2021. \n(Tr. 51, 59.) Applicant has a 401K and retirement assets in her employer-sponsored \nprogram. (Tr. 51.) Her cohabitant has his own pension plan through his work as an \nelectrical engineer with a U.S. manufacturer of audio equipment. (Tr. 39, 51-52.) \nApplicant\u2019s manager has been able to find work for Applicant that does not require \naccess to classified information. Applicant has been led to believe she will not be \nterminated if she is not granted clearance eligibility. However, there have been programs \nthat could have benefitted from her expertise if she had a clearance. (Tr. 33.) \nAdministrative Notice \nThose facts set forth in the Government\u2019s requests for Administrative Notice \nconcerning Iran are adopted and incorporated in this decision. In addition, I have \nconsidered the salient facts set forth in the U.S. State Department\u2019s human rights report for \n2021 concerning Iran, which was not included in the Government\u2019s request. A short \nsummary of relevant facts for administrative notice follows: \nIran is an authoritarian theocratic republic with a Shia Islamic political system. Shia \nclergy, most notably the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and political leaders \nvetted by the clergy, dominate key power structures in Iran. The supreme leader holds \nconstitutional authority over the judiciary, government-run media, and other key institutions, \nincluding all security agencies. The United States has imposed restrictions on activities with \nIran since 1979, following the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

Iran uses the IRGC Qods Force to provide support to terrorist \norganizations, provide cover for covert operations, and create instability in the region. In \n2020, Iran supported various Iraqi Shia terrorist groups, including the Kata\u2019ib Hizballah \nHarakat al-Nujaba whose March 2020 rocket attack killed three members of Defeat-ISIS \nCoalition forces, including two U.S. service members. Through financial or residency \nentitlements, Iran has facilitated and coerced Shia fighters from Afghanistan and Pakistan \nto participate in the Assad regime\u2019s brutal crackdown in Syria. Iran also provided support to \nHamas and other designated Palestinian terrorist groups that were behind deadly attacks \nin Gaza and the West Bank. Iran has continued to provide weapons, support, and training \nto militant groups in Bahrain and Yemen. In December 2021, the U.S. Navy seized \napproximately 1,400 AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition from a vessel bound from Iran to \nthe Houthis in Yemen. \nAs of April 2021, the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment was that Iran will \npresent a continuing threat to U.S. and allied interests in the region as it tries to erode U.S. \ninfluence and support Shia populations abroad; entrench its influence and project power in \nneighboring states; deflect international pressure; and minimize threats to regime stability. \nDespite Iran\u2019s deteriorating economy due in part to U.S.-imposed nuclear-related \nsanctions, the intelligence community expects that Iran will take risks that could escalate \ntensions and threaten U.S. and allied interests. \nIran\u2019s expertise and willingness to conduct aggressive cyber operations make it a \nsignificant threat to the security of U.S. and allied networks and data. Iran has the ability to \nconduct attacks on critical infrastructure and conduct influence and espionage activities. In \nFebruary 2019, a former U.S. counterintelligence agent was charged with espionage for \nallegedly disclosing the code name and classified mission of a DOD special access \nprogram to representatives of Iran\u2019s government. In September 2020, two Iranian nationals \nwith political motivations or acting at the behest of Iran were charged with a coordinated \ncyber intrusion campaign in the theft of hundreds of terabytes of data which included \nconfidential communications pertaining to national security, foreign policy intelligence, non-\nmilitary nuclear information, aerospace data, and human rights activist information. In \nNovember 2020, the United States seized 27 domain names that Iran\u2019s IRGC unlawfully \nused to further a global covert influence campaign. Iranian cyber actors in December 2020 \ndisseminated misinformation about U.S. election officials in an attempt to undermine \nconfidence in the U.S. election. \nSignificant human rights issues in Iran in 2020 and 2021 included credible reports \nof: unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by the government and its \nagents, including executions for crimes not meeting in international legal standards for \nmost serious crimes and for crimes committed by juvenile offenders; forced \ndisappearances by the government; torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment \nor punishment by the government; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary \narrest and detention; politically motivated imprisonment and reprisals; illegal killings, \nkidnappings, or violence; and lack of judicial independence, particularly in the revolutionary \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncourts. Iran also abused the rights of its citizens by unlawful interference with privacy; \nserious restrictions on free expression and media, including violence or threats of violence \nand unjustified arrests and prosecutions against journalists; censorship and serious \nrestrictions on Internet freedom; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful \nassembly and freedom of association; severe restrictions on religious freedom; inability of \ncitizens to change the government through fee and fair elections; serious and \nunreasonable restrictions on political participation; serious government corruption; serious \ngovernment restrictions on or harassment of human rights organizations; lack of \naccountability for violence against women; trafficking in persons; unlawful recruitment of \nchild soldiers; and violence against ethnic minorities. The Iranian government took few \nsteps to identify, investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights \nabuses or corruption. Impunity remained pervasive throughout all levels of government and \nsecurity forces. \nThe U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with Iran. In \nMarch 2021, U.S. President Biden continued for another year the national emergency \ndeclared in March 1995 with respect to Iran as the country continues to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates. The U.S. State Department currently warns against any travel to Iran due to the risk \nof kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. Iranian authorities \ncontinue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens, particularly dual national Iranian-\nAmericans, including students, journalists, business travelers, and academics, on spurious \ncharges including espionage and posing a threat to national security. Iranian authorities \nroutinely delay consular access to detained U.S. citizens and consistently deny consular \naccess to dual U.S.-Iranian citizens. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also  EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings are Iranian resident citizens. Her three brothers \nserved mandatory military service in Iran\u2019s Army. Review of Applicant\u2019s contacts and \nconnections to these foreign citizens are warranted to determine whether they present a \nheightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). \nThose disqualifying conditions provide: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember or a spouse\u2019s family member living under a foreign government. The nature and \nstrength of the family ties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature \nof its government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are \nrelevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has \nan authoritarian government; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the \nforeign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the administrative judge \nmust also take into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s family members in Iran have engaged in any \nactivities contrary to U.S. interests or that they have been targeted or pressured. However, \nIran and the United States have not had good relations since 1979, when the U.S. \nEmbassy was taken over and several of its staff were taken hostage. The United States \nhas been in a state of national emergency with respect to Iran since March 1995 due to the \nextraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates constituted by the actions and polices of Iran\u2019s government. Iran has been \ndesignated by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism. Iran continues to conduct \ncyberattacks against U.S. targets and interests to obtain sensitive information and attempt \nto destabilize the United States through election interference. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. \nThe Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 06-18918 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008), \nciting ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007), that \u201can applicant with family \nmembers living in a country hostile to the U.S. bears a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 in demonstrating that \nthose family members do not pose a security risk.\u201d Four mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 \nwarrant some discussion in this case. They are: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n \n \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 8(a), there is nothing about the occupations of Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers in Iran, or their spouses for that matter, that engenders particular concern. While \nApplicant\u2019s three brothers served in Iran\u2019s Army, their service did not extend beyond the \nmandatory 18 months and occurred sufficiently long ago to not raise current security \nconcerns. None of her family members works directly for Iran\u2019s government. Brother 1 is an \nelectrical engineer with a private telecommunications company. Brother 2 previously \nworked as an English language teacher. He is now pursuing his master\u2019s degree in Iran in \nelectrical engineering, but he has been vetted positively for immigration by the USCIS. \nBrother 3 is employed as a computer engineer at a public medical clinic. Applicant\u2019s Sister \n1 is a high school principal; Sister 2 is a professor at an Iranian public university; and Sister \n3 is a physician at a public hospital. Her siblings are educated and accomplished. It is \nconceivable that pressure or coercion could be placed on them to obtain sensitive or \nclassified information from Applicant. Iran has exhibited little concern for human rights in \nseveral significant aspects and sponsors terrorist activity. AG \u00b6 8(a) cannot reasonably \napply. \nApplicant presents some evidence of mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). There is no \nevidence that she has any loyalty to her native Iran. Her decisions to live and work in the \nUnited States rather than return to Iran after she earned her doctorate degree; to obtain \nU.S. citizenship; and to apply for U.S. immigration for her parents and siblings are \nconsistent with allegiance to the United States. She has owned a home in the United \nStates since 2016 and has no financial assets in Iran. These actions are objective \nevidence that lend substantial credibility to her assertion that she has no allegiance to Iran. \nAt the same time, she retains some ties to Iran in her renewal and retention of an Iranian \npassport so that she can travel to Iran to see her family members. She intends to renew \nher Iranian passport, which his scheduled to expire in June 2022, to avoid having to obtain \na visa if she meets her family in Turkey, or for a future trip to Iran where it might be very \ndifficult to obtain a visa. While her ongoing possession of an Iranian passport is reflective \nof her admittedly close ties to her family members in Iran and not of a preference for Iran, it \nis a means by which Iranian authorities could impose pressure or obligations. At a \nminimum, it alerts Iran of her entry into the country. While in Iran, Applicant\u2019s activities \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncould be tracked without her knowing. Applicant has traveled to Iran annually over the \nyears to see her parents and siblings, including as recently as August 2021, when her \nfather was seriously ill. It is conceivable that pressure could be brought to bear on \nApplicant either directly on a future trip to Iran or indirectly through her family members in \nIran. Applicant testified credibly that she notified her employer of her trips to Iran, but that is \nnot enough to mitigate the risk of undue foreign influence in this case. Such notification of \nher travel to Iran is evidence of her willingness to comply with reporting requirements under \nAG \u00b6 8(e), but it has no impact on the actions of Iranian authorities. Iran is reported to \nunjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans, on \nspurious charges, and Applicant\u2019s area of expertise could be of use to the Iranian \ngovernment. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s contacts and communications with her family \nmembers are neither casual nor infrequent. She contacts her parents weekly and her \nsiblings monthly or quarterly. Her close, continuing contacts with her parents and siblings in \nIran show her good character, but they also make it more likely that she could be placed in \na position of having to choose between them and the interests of the United States. Her \nties to the United States, established over only the last 10 to 11 years, are not enough to \nfully mitigate the risk of undue foreign influence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Those factors are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nIn foreign influence cases it must be acknowledged that people act in unpredictable \nways when faced with choices that could be important to a family member. As reiterated by \nthe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 19-01688 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2020), \u201cApplication \nof the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an \nacknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that \ncould be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.\u201d Moreover, in evaluating \nGuideline B concerns, the Appeal Board has held that: \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose a \nsecurity risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts and \ncircumstances not under their control. \nApplicant has acted consistent with U.S. interests in many aspects of life over which \nshe has control. In some cases, such as voting in Iranian elections in 2013 and 2017 while \nliving in the United States, and possessing and using an Iranian passport, she exercised \nher Iranian citizenship. Applicant is likely to travel to Iran in the future on her Iranian \npassport to see her family members. The U.S. State Department reports that Iranian \nauthorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison dual nationals who travel to Iran. \nMoreover, it is conceivable that undue pressure could be placed on one or more of her \nfamily members in Iran were Iranian authorities to learn of her work for a U.S. defense \ncontractor, especially if she had classified access. \nAn unacceptable risk of undue foreign influence persists in light of her close familial \nrelations in Iran. The decision to grant or deny security clearance eligibility is not a one-time \nassessment. Should Applicant succeed in her efforts to bring her family members to the \nUnited States, she may be able to overcome the security concerns at some future date. \nHowever, based on the evidence before me, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly \nconsistent to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The September 7, 2021 SOR alleges under SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant did not file state taxes for 2013 through 2018. In his September 9, 2021 answer, he denied the allegation without explanation. AE E reflects that he did not file the missing state returns until May 2020. Applicant provided documentation of signed state tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2017. For tax years 2013 and 2018, there is documentation that various schedules were filed for those years, but no actual signed income tax returns were included, as with the 2014 through 2017 returns. (However, there is other documentation verifying that the 2018 state tax return was in fact processed by the state tax agency.) (AE C at 21) Applicant\u2019s late filing of his 2020 state tax return a week before the hearing was due to his inability to obtain a waiver from the state taxing authority for his wife\u2019s Social Security disability benefits. Applicant provided substantial documentation confirming that he has filed all state tax returns and owes no state taxes. (Tr. 31, 35-36) See also, AE C at 21-23; AE E at 40-94. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant failed to file federal tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2017, and he owed $2,199 in back taxes for federal tax year 2018. In his answer, he admitted he did not file federal tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2017, and he owed federal taxes as alleged for federal tax year 2018.

Farrell, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Troy L. Nussbaum, Esq. \n12/29/2022 \nDecision \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant exercised poor judgment by failing to file federal and state tax returns \nand pay taxes for several years. He demonstrated good judgment in filing all by one state \ntax return and all of his federal tax returns. He owes no state taxes and has been paying \n$500 a month under a payment plan with the federal tax agency for approximately 18 \nmonths. Eligibility for access to a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 16, 2019, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On April 4 and April 11, 2019, he provided personal subject \ninterviews (PSIs) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). \nAfter reviewing the results of a security background investigation, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required to grant a \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance, and issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nNovember 9, 2020, detailing security concerns under financial considerations (Guideline \nF). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June \n8, 2017. \nApplicant provided his answer to the SOR on September 9, 2021. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on September 27, \n2022, for a hearing on October 26, 2022. I held the hearing on the scheduled date. Three \nof the Government\u2019s four exhibits (GE) 1-3 were entered into evidence without objection. \nApplicant objected to the fourth exhibit, a December 2019 credit bureau report, averring \nthat the report was irrelevant to the SOR, which addresses only taxes. Department \nCounsel responded that the report provided a more accurate depiction of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial status. I overruled the objection and admitted GE 4 in order to develop a full \nrecord. (Tr. 13) Applicant\u2019s seven exhibits (AE) A-G were entered into evidence without \nobjection. I granted him additional time to submit post-hearing documentation. His \nsubmissions of AE H through AE K, which were submitted before the expiration of the \nNovember 10, 2022 deadline, were entered into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 9, 2021. The record closed on \nNovember 3, 2022. \nRulings on Evidence \nDuring the early portion of the hearing (Tr. 5, 6), the Government moved to \namend the SOR with three additional allegations under paragraph 1 of Guideline F as \nfollows: \nc. You are indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the \namount of $1,559 for tax year 2014. As of the date of the SOR, the taxes \nremain unpaid. \nd. You are indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the \namount of $7,998 for tax year 2015. As of the date of the SOR, the taxes \nremain unpaid.  \ne. You are indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the \namount of $3,814 for tax year 2016. As of the date of the SOR, the taxes \nremain unpaid.  \nI failed to ask Applicant\u2019s attorney for his position on the proposed amendments, \nbut his attorney provided a straightforward position by indicating that Applicant has been \nregularly paying the Internal revenue Service (IRS) in an active repayment plan for more \nthan a year to address his delinquent federal taxes.

I admitted the Motion to Amend into \nevidence as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. \nFindings of Fact \nThe September 7, 2021 SOR alleges under SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant did not file \nstate taxes for 2013 through 2018. In his September 9, 2021 answer, he denied the \nallegation without explanation. AE E reflects that he did not file the missing state returns \nuntil May 2020. Applicant provided documentation of signed state tax returns for tax years \n2014 through 2017. For tax years 2013 and 2018, there is documentation that various \nschedules were filed for those years, but no actual signed income tax returns were \nincluded, as with the 2014 through 2017 returns. (However, there is other documentation \nverifying that the 2018 state tax return was in fact processed by the state tax agency.) \n(AE C at 21) Applicant\u2019s late filing of his 2020 state tax return a week before the hearing \nwas due to his inability to obtain a waiver from the state taxing authority for his wife\u2019s \nSocial Security disability benefits. Applicant provided substantial documentation \nconfirming that he has filed all state tax returns and owes no state taxes. (Tr. 31, 35-36) \nSee also, AE C at 21-23; AE E at 40-94. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant failed to file federal tax returns for tax years \n2013 through 2017, and he owed $2,199 in back taxes for federal tax year 2018. In his \nanswer, he admitted he did not file federal tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2017, \nand he owed federal taxes as alleged for federal tax year 2018. Applicant\u2019s response in \nan attachment to his answer and his hearing testimony constitute admissions to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. He mentioned a $500-a-month payment plan with the IRS. He was \nwilling to increase the amount of payments to repay the debt sooner. His daughter, who \nlives with him, pays some of the household bills while he pays the mortgage and car \ninsurance on two cars. (Attachment to Applicant\u2019s September 2021 answer to SOR; Tr. \n31, 39, 66-67) \nApplicant is 68 years old. He has been married since 1977, and has five adult-\naged children, ages 34 to 45. Also in 1977, he received vocational training for certification \nas an electrician. He has owned his own home since 1992. He became a United States \ncitizen in 1998. Since December 2018, he has been a maintenance mechanic for a \ndefense contractor. Though he testified that he worked as a cleaner for a different \ncontractor from 1990 to 2012, his January 2019 e-QIP indicates he worked as a \nmaintenance worker for a private employer since March 2000. Additional information that \ndoes not appear in his e-QIP is his handy man business that he started in 2012, and he \ncontinues to operate on an occasional basis. Applicant contended that he did not provide \ntax information in his January 2019 e-QIP because he did not remember any question on \nthe form requiring information about taxes. (GE 1 at 8-38; GE 2 at 7, 11; Tr. 23-27) \nWhile Applicant was working for the Government as a cleaner between 1990 and \n2012, his taxes were regularly withheld from his earnings. (Tr. 48) When he opened his \nhandy man business in 2012, he did not withhold any taxes and did not report his taxes \nas he should have because of his unfamiliarity with how the tax system operated for a \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nself-employed person. Applicant started his own business because he believed that he \ncould make a lot more money than working at his government job. He never set money \naside for his tax obligations. He returned to his government job in 2018 because he was \nnot generating enough income to cover his debts, especially with two children attending \ncollege. The government job provided more security. (Tr. 25-30, 48-49) \nBefore tax year 2013, Applicant indicated that he filed his federal tax returns on \ntime with the assistance of a tax preparation business (A) that subsequently closed. In \n2014, (tax year 2013), he stopped using them because he thought that he could receive \na better deal from a second tax service (B). (Tr. 28) In subsequent testimony, he indicated \nthat he was dissatisfied with tax preparer A\u2019s service. (Tr. 51). Tax preparer B generated \na draft of the federal return for tax year 2013, but doubled the fee that tax preparer A \ncharged. After seeing the draft return, he realized that he owed taxes for tax year 2013. \nUnhappy with the larger fee of the tax preparer B, Applicant decided to prepare and file \nthe 2013 federal return himself. He did not know he could apply for an extension to file \nthe 2013 return and did not call the IRS for help. He did not know about filing extensions \nuntil 2018 when his daughter began providing help in preparing his returns. (Tr. 50-55) \nAfter a hearing recess was taken to consult with his attorney concerning the filing of the \n2013 federal tax return, Applicant provided confusing testimony about why he did not file \nhis return for tax year 2013, particularly when he indicated he had the necessary records \nto file the return. (Tr. 57-59) I find that not having the money to pay for tax services \nincreased Applicant\u2019s procrastination, especially when he knew he owed taxes for 2013. \nHe did not file his 2013 federal tax returns on time in 2014. In May 2015, an insurance \ncompany (C) prepared and filed his 2013 tax returns. (GE 2 at 10; GE 3 at 5; AE A at 15; \nTr. 39-40, 63) \nApplicant claimed that his extensive work schedule prevented him from filing his \n2014 through 2017 federal returns. According to his tax-account transcripts, the missing \nfederal returns for 2014 through 2017 tax years were filed between February and July \n2021. (AE A at 7-14) Applicant transferred about five years of federal tax records, which \nhe stored in ledgers and notebooks, to tax company (D) and paid them about $1,000 to \nprepare and file the missing tax returns in 2021. (Tr. 54, 59-63) \nApplicant testified that he decided to file the missing (state) returns in May 2020 \nbecause he told the investigator in April 2019 that not filing tax returns for several years \nwould be an issue. (Tr. 64-66; AE A at 1-12; AE C at 21-23; AE E at 40-94) Applicant did \nnot want to give the impression to the investigator that he was not going to file his returns, \nso he filed them all. (Tr. 64-65) After he replied to GE 3 with answers to his federal and \nstate tax issues, and attached federal tax transcripts in May 2020, he filed the missing \nfederal returns with tax preparer D in 2021. (Tr. 64-66; AE A at 1-12) Though he claimed \nthe May 2020 interrogatories from the Government (GE 3) were not the primary reason \nwhy he filed the returns, and that he was going to file them anyway, the established fact \nis that in May 2020, the missing federal returns were at least four years delinquent when \ntax preparer D filed them in 2021. Applicant filed his federal tax returns for 2018 through \n2021 on time. (Tr. 36; AE A at 1-6) \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegarding the back taxes that Applicant owes the IRS, he telephoned the agency \nin April 2021, and set up a payment plan of $500 a month. After an initial payment of over \n$1,400, he has been making regular payments of $500 a month since. The IRS sends \nhim a monthly payment voucher and he returns the voucher with a $500 check. As of \nNovember 2, 2022, Applicant owed $12,949 to the IRS. (Tr. 67-69; AE I at 1-6; AE J at 1-\n3) \nTo avoid tax problems in the future, Applicant has employed a certified public \naccount (CPA) to prepare all his future tax returns. This CPA prepared Applicant\u2019s 2020 \nstate tax returns. Applicant knows that the only way to avoid tax problems in the future is \nto file his tax returns and pay his taxes. His wife and children will remind him to prepare \nand file his tax returns, and pay his taxes. (Tr. 37, 41, 72-73; AE F at 96; AE K) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s son submitted a character statement about Applicant, his father. The \nson served in the United States Marines for 15 years and became proficient at handling \nmilitary travel claims. He believes that Applicant has plenty of experience in home \nimprovement and office repair. Though he may not have an extensive background in \ncomputers, he has provided a work-ethic example for his five children to follow. (AE D at \n24-25) \nApplicant\u2019s oldest daughter respects him for his dedication to hard work to \nenhance the family\u2019s security. He has always demonstrated a willingness to help those \npeople who are down on their luck. (AE C at 36) \nA friend, who has known Applicant for 30 years, believes that he is dedicated to \nhis family, church, and friends in the neighborhood community. (AE D at 26) \nSix friends met Applicant as coworkers and have become close friends. They \nconsider Applicant responsible, honest, trustworthy, and unselfish. A friend and coworker \nfor the past 10 years, has found Applicant to be a skilled employee who is conscientious \nand dependable. Two customers are clearly impressed with the repairs that Applicant has \nmade to their homes. (AE D at 26-29, 34, 35, 37) \nA friend of 25 years considers Applicant a loyal friend who is knowledgeable in \nhome repair. In the last 21 years of their friendship, another friend and Applicant have \nattended church on a regular basis. Another friend lauds Applicant\u2019s work ethic and \nprofessionalism. Another friend commends his leadership and problem-solving abilities, \ncoupled with his poetic eloquence. (AE C at 30-33) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor since December 2018 has observed Applicant\u2019s \naccommodating personality enhance his company\u2019s customer relations and overall \nsuccess.

He demonstrates quality \nleadership and team player capabilities. (AE C at 39) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant recited a poem from his second book of poems \nentitled \u201cA Second Look at Poetry.\u201d (Tr. 42-43) He wrote the poem to memorialize his \nappreciation for the advantages and opportunities of living and working in the United \nStates. (Tr. 43-44) In a two-page salutary statement, Applicant thanked his two sisters \nand brothers for sponsoring him for immigration to the United States in 1987. He brought \nhis oldest daughter with him, hoping that she could obtain needed medical treatment that \nwas unavailable in his home country. Due to a delay in the immigration process, she was \nunable to get the proper medical attention. Nonetheless, he is still certain he made the \nright decision to come to America. (AE G) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines should \nbe applied with common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the \nnational security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources \nof income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAn applicant who seeks a security clearance with the Government must \ndemonstrate good judgment and trustworthiness. A gauge of his judgment and \ntrustworthiness is how he manages his personal affairs. An applicant who has a history \nof financial irresponsibility in not filing or paying his federal and state taxes in a timely \nmanner may also demonstrate the same irresponsibility in failing to comply with rules and \nregulations for safeguarding sensitive or classified information. The timing by an applicant \nin filing his tax returns and paying his taxes is critical to a whole-person assessment of \nhis reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as required. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal and state tax returns and \npay his federal and state taxes invokes security concerns under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. By not consistently fulfilling his legal obligation to file returns, an \napplicant shows poor judgment and unreliability that can disqualify him from security \nclearance eligibility. See, 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug.18, 2015) AG \u00b6 19(c) applies \nbecause Applicant has a history of not meeting delinquent federal and state income taxes \nbetween 2013 and 2018. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies because of his failure to file federal and state \ntax returns for 2013 through 2018 and pay the corresponding taxes in a timely manner. \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s federal and state tax problems began in 2014 (federal tax year 2013) \nwhen he stopped using tax preparer A. He did not make documented efforts to correct \nthe state tax issues until May 2020. While he filed his 2013 federal return in 2015, he did \nnot file the other listed federal returns until 2021. Though he owes no state taxes, he still \nowes $12,949 in federal taxes. Only limited mitigation is available to him under AG \u00b6 \n20(a). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply to the circumstances of this case because there were \nno unanticipated events leading to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. His decision to leave \nhis government job to open a handy man business in 2012, believing he could earn more \nmoney than his government job, was a decision within his control. His decision to prepare \nhis own taxes in 2014 (for tax year 2013) was another decision within his control. When \nApplicant discovered he owed taxes for 2013, he did not act responsibly to fulfill his tax \nobligations. Instead of becoming proactive in filing his state and federal tax returns, he \ndid nothing until May 2020. Neither prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) is available to Applicant. \nApplicant began to put his tax issues in order when he learned from his daughter \nin 2018 that he could seek an extension to file his tax returns. With her assistance, \nApplicant filed his 2018 through 2021 federal tax returns in a timely manner. Though there \nis no evidence of financial counseling, the daughter\u2019s help in restoring Applicant\u2019s tax \nresponsibilities deserves limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). \nBoth AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) apply based on Applicant\u2019s conduct in setting up a \npayment plan in April 2021, and making regular monthly payments under the plan since \nthen. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 68 years old and has been married since 1977. He has five adult-\naged children. Applicant\u2019s coworkers and friends describe him as a reliable and \ntrustworthy person with impressive leadership credentials. He is widely respected for his \nexpertise in home management and repair. Because of his engaging personality, \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor lauds Applicant\u2019s effective interaction with customers. \nI am convinced that Applicant does not want to relive the serious tax problems \nthat he incurred when he opened his own business without considering the tax \nramifications. Applicant recognizes that he must: (1) regularly file his state and federal tax \nreturns; (2) when necessary, obtain an extension for additional time to file; and, (3) pay \nstate and federal taxes as required. Considering the evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s \nevidence in mitigation overcomes the adverse evidence presented under the guideline \nfor financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n    Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:                           \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant denies any falsification of his December 2018 Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) as it relates to Section 26 and \nenquires as to financial delinquencies in the last seven years. (TR at page 29 line 22 to \npage 32 line 18, and GX 1 at page 35.) As noted above, in the findings for allegations \n1.a.~1.f., Applicant was unaware of any past-due indebtedness when he executed his e-\nQIP, and, in fact, he has no past-due indebtedness. This allegation is found for \nApplicant.  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant, arguably, had some past-due indebtedness The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhatever financial problems Applicant had, they are a thing of the past. He \ncurrent with all his creditors, and has completed financial counseling. He has \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nbeen established. Financial Considerations is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nI find no willful falsification by Applicant, as he was unaware of any past-due \ndebts when he executed his December 2018 e-QIP. Personal Conduct is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant is well respected in his \ncommunity and in the work place. (AppX I.) For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On December 22, 2021, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865 (EO), Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 14, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 11, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on May 13, 2022, \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 5, 2022. The Government offered \nthree exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were admitted \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \nwithout objection. The Applicant offered one exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, \nwhich was admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 25, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 43 years old. He is unmarried and has one child. He has two years \nof college and military training. He holds the position of Quality Test Inspector. He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified. \nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from August 2000 to March 2011. During his \nmilitary career, he underwent three separate deployments, one involving war. His \nhighest rank earned was an E-4, Petty Officer Third Class. He received an honorable \ndischarge. He was issued his first security clearance in the military. \nAfter leaving the military, Applicant went to work in 2013 for a defense contractor, \nwhere he remains employed. Applicant admits that he struggles with the impact and \neffects of what he believes to be Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from his \nexperiences during his military deployments. Although Applicant has never undergone \na thorough psychiatric evaluation, he has sought out help from his company Employee \nAssistance Program (EAP), and has received counseling on two separate occasions. \nApplicant admits to a history and pattern of inappropriate, uncontrolled, emotional \noutbursts, getting upset, yelling, and swearing in front of his co-workers in the \nworkplace. He blames these outbursts on how other people speak to him. He admits \nthat his ability to maintain composure is limited by outside stressors that cause him to \nbecome upset more easily in the workplace. Applicant\u2019s misconduct is against the \ncompany policies, rules, and regulations, and is clearly prohibited. Applicant admitted \nthat he was first spoken to about his unprofessional, inappropriate, emotional outbursts \nin the workplace in either 2014 or 2015.  (Tr. p. 73.) He has been verbally counseled on \nfour separate occasions, received two written warnings, and two suspensions for this \nmisconduct. (Tr. 73-74.) \n1.a. In September 2016, Applicant agreed to submit to a company EAP assessment \nafter he posted information on social media expressing anger toward others and stating \nthat he was legally able to purchase a firearm. An investigation of this matter revealed \nthat Applicant was experiencing a medical issue and was not receiving the required \nmedication. \nApplicant agreed to attend EAP counseling sessions with monitoring \nconducted by the company. He was not disciplined by the company on this occasion. \n2 \n\nApplicant stated that he completed six one-hour counseling sessions arranged by his \ncompany. Applicant claims that his media posts were taken out of context. He states \nthat his reference to the gun was expressing his interest in taking up a new hobby of \ntarget shooting. The only gun he has ever owned was when he was in the military. \n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  \n1.b. On February 14, 2017, Applicant engaged in a verbal argument with an employee \nscreaming and using profanity the workplace. In discussion with his manager, Applicant \nagreed to take vacation time and leave work early that day. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nSOR, Government Exhibit 3, and Tr. p. 75.) \n1.c. On February 27, 2017, Applicant was removed from the workplace for outbursts of \nanger involving threatening and intimidating conduct. Applicant engaged in a verbal \nargument with another employee screaming and using profanity. Applicant received a \nfive-day suspension without pay. \nApplicant acknowledges his wrongdoing and \naccepted the Employee Performance Notice given to him by his management. On April \n17, 2017, Applicant received an Employee Performance Notice addressing his prior \nmisconduct and informing him that repetition of similar misconduct may be cause for \nfurther disciplinary action up to and including termination. (Government Exhibit 3 and \nTr.p. 76-79.) \n1.d. On October 21, 2019, Applicant was involved in a verbal disagreement between \nhimself and another employee. \nApplicant was removed from the work place and \nsuspended pending an investigation of his verbal outburst followed by a threatening \nstatement. On this occasion, Applicant began arguing with a Tooling Inspector about \nhis job assignment. Applicant was screaming, using profanity. The Tooling Inspector \ntold Applicant that he could speak to his manager about it if he had an issue with the \nassignment. Applicant continued to scream and swear, and slammed a door, and then \nstated something to the effect, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I can do.\u201d A threat management \nteam was convened on October 2, 2019. As a result of the investigation, Applicant was \nremoved from the workplace. \nHe received a six-day unpaid suspension for \ninappropriate behavior, and was given a last change agreement. (Government Exhibit 3 \nand Tr. p. 23.) \n1.e. Applicant completed a security clearance application dated September 16, 2021. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) \nSection 13A, Employment Activities, asked the Applicant, \nwhether in the last seven years has he received a written warning, been officially \nreprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a \nviolation of security policy? Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d This was not a correct answer.  \nApplicant has in fact received several written warnings in the past seven years for \nworkplace misconduct, specifically verbal outbursts, and threatening and intimidating \nmisconduct in the workplace, including two suspensions. Applicant claims that he did \nnot intentionally falsify any information in the security clearance application. Applicant \nstates that he was focused on the \u201cviolation of security policy\u201d clause of the question, \nand he did not consider the entire question like he should have. He has not violated \nany security policies to his knowledge and therefore he answered the question like he \ndid. (Tr. pp. 78-80.) \n3 \n\n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNot alleged in the SOR is an incident that occurred in August 2020, shortly after \nnews of a fire breaking out at the company facility. Applicant posted on facebook, a \npicture of a burned down guard shack and commented, \u201cNot official yet but looks like I \nlost my job. I didn\u2019t get fired though, . . . the base did. . . I guess dreams do come true. \nI may get my wish to leave California. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant stated that he \ndoes not like living in California, is only living here because of his daughter, and was \nhappy he could leave California. (Tr. pp. 70-71.) \nApplicant was recently seen by a Veteran\u2019s Administration hospital and has more \nappointments scheduled to pursue help for his medical problem. Applicant recently lost \na veteran friend to suicide. (Tr. p. 42.) \nApplicant\u2019s security officer and a co-worker testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They \nboth understand that he is sensitive and has difficulty in controlling his anger. They \nacknowledge that he has been inappropriate and unprofessional. They understand, \nhowever that he may be suffering from symptoms of PTSD that is not being treated. \nThey consider Applicant to be a hard worker, and state that he is loved by those he \nworks closely with. They recommend Applicant for a security clearance. (Tr. pp. 21-31, \nand 87-102.) \nA letter of recommendation from an Engineer that works with the Applicant states \nthat Applicant is one of the hardest workers he has ever met. He is a valued team \nmember and well-liked by others. \nHe recommends him for a security clearance. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a)deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nguideline, but which, when considered as a while, supports a while-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nFirst, Applicant was either careless or not candid when he answered the question \non his security clearance application about his past written warnings, reprimands and \nsuspensions he has received by his employer in the last seven years.  In either case, he \nmust be able to read and understand the simple meaning of the question on the \napplication, and answer it correctly, in order to be found eligible for access to classified \ninformation. Second, although it was brought to my attention that profanity is often used \nin the workplace, it is not acceptable here. Applicant\u2019s history of inappropriate personal \nconduct at work has escalated involving emotional outbursts, abusive language, \nincluding profanity, intimidation, screaming, and yelling at co-workers that is egregious, \noutrageous and against company policy and DoD standards of decency and \nprofessionalism. Applicant\u2019s conduct creates a hostile, uncomfortable, and possibly \nviolent workplace. Applicant\u2019s conduct shows noncompliance with rules, procedures \nand guidelines designed to make the workplace a pleasant, peaceful and safe \nenvironment. \nApplicant\u2019s profanity and social media posts go beyond just being \ndisrespectful.  Applicant\u2019s consistent pattern of behavior is indicative of an insider threat. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a)the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b)the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual specifically \nconcerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and \ntruthfully. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s misconduct is egregious. From the evidence \npresented, Applicant has been more than disrespectful to his coworkers and others in \nthe workplace without justification or excuse. Applicant has received several notices \nfrom his management for misconduct arriving from his uncontrolled emotional outbursts. \nand has been told that if it happens again, he may be confronted with termination. The \nextreme unprofessionalism here is not to be tolerated by Defense Department or its \ncontractors. \nApplicant is required to follow all DoD rules, regulations and company policies \nand procedures. A security clearance is a privilege and not a right. To be found \neligible, it must be clearly consistent with the national interests to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance. This decision must be made in accordance with the DoD Directive \nand its guidelines. \nBased upon the information presented, Applicant\u2019s history of \nmisconduct in the workplace shows poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness \nand prevents him from being eligible for access to classified information. The Personal \nConduct guideline is found against Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant testified that he is seeking help with the Veteran\u2019s Administration \nservices for his uncontrolled outbursts and related problems. This is a step in the right \ndirection. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e. \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

(AE 5) He paid both accounts after he was \nconfronted about his delinquent debts during his October 2020 Office of Personnel \nManagement investigative interview, and after he received the SOR in July 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR admissions, and those at his hearing, are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 63 years old. He graduated from high school in 1977, received a \ncertificate of completion for a technical school in 1981, and a certificate of completion for \na graphic design school in 2016. He married in 1986 and divorced in 2008. He has two \nadult children, ages 31 and 28. He has been living with a cohabitant since around 2020. \n(Tr. 25) \nApplicant was employed as a computer automated design drafter (CADD) from \n1987 to 2012.

He worked as a customer service associate between \n2014 and 2018. He started working as an armed security guard in October 2018. His \ncurrent employer and security sponsor, a federal contractor, hired him as a security officer \nin July 2020. Since 2012, he has had only one two-week period of unemployment in-\nbetween jobs, but some positions were part-time jobs and his earnings were low. (Tr. 26-\n28) \nApplicant is making about $2,000 a month, sometimes more depending on \novertime. At the end of the month, he has $50 to $100 of disposable income in his \nchecking account. He has less than $50 in his savings account. (Tr. 39) He rents an \napartment and shares the $2,200 rent with his roommate. He carries five credit cards and \nhis total outstanding debt is about $3,700. \nIn Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had \nfinancial problems that included owing income taxes to the IRS for TY 2013, because he \ndid not have the money to pay it. He also disclosed he failed to file income tax returns for \nTYs 2013 through 2019 because he owed too much and was afraid of the penalties and \ninterest accrued. (GE 1; Tr. 31) \nApplicant admitted, and the documentary evidence shows that he failed to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns for TYs 2008 through 2019. He is indebted to the \nFederal government for delinquent taxes for approximately $15,611 for TY 2008 and \n$14,944 for TY 2009. He stated that he completed his TY 2008 income tax form, and \nwhen he saw how much he owed, he did not file it because he did not have the money to \npay the tax owed. He did not file income tax returns for TYs 2009 through 2019 because \nhe did not have the money to pay the penalties and interest he accrued. He claimed he \nfiled his income tax returns for TYs before 2008. He prepared and filed his TYs 2020 and \n2021 income tax returns. He was expecting a $174 refund for TY 2020, but the IRS \napplied the refund to his 2008 delinquent taxes. There was no refund for TY 2021. (Tr. \n33-34) \nApplicant believes his failure to file his tax returns stemmed from his divorce in \n2008. When his ex-wife bought out the marital home, he received $90,000 for his share \nof the property. He failed to set aside sufficient money to pay taxes for the transaction. \nHe loaned some of the money to a friend who never paid him back, and he cannot \nremember how he spent the rest. He explained that after his divorce, he was not in a good \nstate of mind and did things that were not smart and made bad choices. Prior to his \ndivorce, he believes his record would indicate that he was reliable. \nApplicant noted that he works hard, but does not earn that much money. He \nbelieves he is not a spendthrift; he does his job and then goes home because he does \nnot have money to waste. He believes he has made efforts and achieved progress \nresolving his tax problems with the IRS, and paying his debts. (Tr. 31) \nApplicant did not pay the delinquent taxes he owed for TYs 2008 ($15,611) and \n2009 ($14,944).

He believes the IRS cannot collect the delinquent tax \ndebt for 2008 and 2009, because the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED) passed. \nInternal Revenue Code section 6502 provides that the length of the period for collection \nafter assessment of a tax liability is 10 years. The collection statute expiration ends the \ngovernment's right to pursue collection of a liability. Applicant did not provide the dates \nthe IRS assessed his tax liability. He believes that he does not owe any back taxes to the \nIRS. However, his evidence fails to establish that he filed income tax returns for TYs 2008 \nthrough 2014, or that the IRS has accepted the income tax returns he filed for TYs 2015 \nto 2019 in August 2021. \nBetween 2008 and August 2021, Applicant made no effort to file his delinquent \nincome tax returns for TYs 2008 through 2019. In August 2021, he retained the services \nof a tax relief company seeking help to file past-due tax returns and resolve his tax debt. \nHe claimed he prepared and filed his TYs 2012 to 2014 income tax returns. He presented \nno documentary evidence to show that he filed income tax returns for TYs 2008 through \n2014. His documentary evidence shows that the tax relief company he retained filed his \nTYs 2015 to 2019 income tax returns on August 2021. (AE 7) \nAccording to IRS regulations, in 2012, a person making over $9,750 gross income \nhad to file an income tax return, and in 2021, the filing threshold was $12,550 gross \nincome. Applicant did not present documentary evidence to show he was below the IRS \nfiling threshold for the years in question. \nApplicant believes that if he is granted clearance eligibility, he will be able to \nresolve all of his financial problems. He noted he was been upfront and truthful during the \nclearance process. He stated that in 2015, his credit rating was about 580, and he has \nraised it to about 710 recently. He believes that shows his financial situation is improving. \nHe has been paying his bills on time and maintaining good credit, and he intends to \ncontinue to do so in the future. He believes that he is in a good place now, with a steady \njob, and steady living conditions; his life is good right now. (Tr. 54) He noted that he timely \nfiled income tax returns for TYs 2020 and 2021. His intent is to continue filing his tax \nreturns on time and to pay his taxes. \nApplicant promised to be financially responsible in the future. He presented no \nevidence to show that he is following a budget or that he has participated in financial \ncounseling. However, I will consider he has received financial counseling through his tax \nrelief company. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec.

Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an a\n pplicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He failed to timely \nfile federal income tax returns for TY 2008 through 2019. He presented no documentary \nevidence to show that he ever filed tax returns for TYs 2008 to 2014. He owed the IRS \nabout $15,611 for unpaid taxes for TY 2008 and $14,994 for TY 2015. He presented no \nevidence of efforts to make any payments or enter into a payment agreement with the \nIRS since he accrued the delinquent taxes. He failed to prove the CSED bars the IRS \nfrom collecting the delinquent taxes because he failed to provide the date the IRS \nassessed the tax debts. Moreover, he did not establish that he failed to request any \nextensions in the statute of limitations, which taxpayers sometimes request to delay \napplication \nof \na \nlevy \non \ntheir \nincome. \nSee \nIRS \nwebsite, \nhttps://www.irs.gov/irm/part5/irm 05-001-\n019#:~:text=Internal%20Revenue%20Code%20section%206502,pursue%20collection \n%20of%20a%20liability. Additionally, he had an unpaid medical debt for $1,352 in \ncollection since 2017, and a $174 charged-off account from 2014. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns . . . or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The \nrecord established these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant stated that his failure to file his income tax returns and to pay his taxes \nwas caused by a combination of his divorce and periods of underemployment. After his \ndivorce, he was not in a good state of mind and did things that were not smart and made \nbad choices. Apparently, he lost his job and for a period of two years, he only held small \nor part-time job paying low wages. His underemployment made his financial situation \ndifficult. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered as circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control his divorce and \nunderemployment. These circumstances could have adversely affected his ability to \ntimely file his income tax returns, albeit for a short period, or aggravated his financial \nsituation. I do not find his failure to file his tax returns as a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol. I note that Applicant\u2019s divorce was in 2012, but he failed to file tax returns for TYs \n2008 to 2012. He testified that he failed to file tax returns for TYs 2008 and 2009 because \nhe did not have the money to pay his taxes, and he did not file the following years because \nhe was afraid of the penalties and interest he would owe for his failure to timely file and \nto pay his taxes. \nAs of the day of his hearing, Applicant presented no documentary evidence to \nshow he had filed his TYs 2008 to 2014 tax returns. He filed his federal income tax returns \nfor TYs 2015 to 2019 in 2021, after he received the SOR. He took no action to pay his \ndelinquent taxes for TYs 2008 and 2009. He paid the two debts alleged in the SOR after \nhe received the SOR. His evidence is insufficient to establish that he has been financially \nresponsible under the circumstances. \nApplicant disclosed his tax problems in his September 2020 SCA. He also \nanswered questions about his tax problems when he was interviewed in October 2020. \nThese incidents should have crystalized for Applicant the security concerns raised by his \nfailure to file income tax returns, and the importance for him to do so. Notwithstanding, \nhe did nothing to file his delinquent federal income tax returns until August 2021, after he \nreceived the SOR. \nAbout the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA \nAppeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008).

He failed to establish full mitigation of the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. I am unable to find that Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to timely file his \nincome tax returns or pay his taxes. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. \nThey continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of \nwhether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My \ncomments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 63, seeks clearance eligibility for the first time. The evidence against \ngrant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is substantial. He failed to timely file federal income \ntax returns for many years, and he failed to pay delinquent federal taxes. His financial \nproblems are recent and not under control. \nApplicant knew that he needed to file his federal income tax returns and pay his \nincome taxes. Whether he knew he was going to receive refunds or had sufficient or \ninsufficient funds to pay any taxes owed, he had a legal requirement to timely file his tax \nreturns. He did not fully understand or appreciate the importance of timely filing of tax \nreturns in security clearance determinations. His promises of future financial responsibility \nare insufficient to fully mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 45 years old. She has worked as an engineer for her current employer, a U.S. Government contractor, since June 2022. She worked for other contractors for a number of years prior to her current employment. She enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2006 and was honorably discharged in 2014, with the pay grade of E-4. She deployed twice to war zones as a contractor. At the same time she also discharged her duties as a Reservist. She was granted eligibility for a Secret security clearance in 2006 and again in 2011. She is presently applying for eligibility for a Top Secret clearance. She has never married and has no children. (Tr. at 18-22, 26; GE 1 at 57-58; GE 2 at 25.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended with delinquent debts and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR identifies five debts in collection totaling about $53,000. In her Answer, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations and provided additional explanations regarding her understanding of the status of the debts. She also attached three credit reports, dated October 14, 2021. The existence and amounts of these debts is supported by the Government\u2019s credit reports in the record dated March 4, 2021; September 3, 2020; February 23, 2017; and September 20, 2022.

Credit-card debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $577. \nApplicant opened this account in November 2010. She defaulted on the account in about \n2015, and the creditor referred the account for collection.

She wrote in her October 2021 Answer that she called the creditor and \nwas advised that it had no record of this account. The creditor advised Applicant to contact \nthe credit bureau reporting the debt and to ask that the debt be removed from its report. \nIn 2021 she submitted a dispute to have the debt removed because it had been paid. The \nGovernment\u2019s most recent credit report reflects that she opened a new credit-card \naccount with this creditor in July 2018, and that the new account was current. The \ncreditor\u2019s action of opening a new account in Applicant\u2019s name provides evidence that \nshe paid the account alleged in SOR 1.a prior to 2018 and that the contrary credit bureau \nreport is erroneous. This former debt was resolved many years ago. (Tr. at 28-29, 31-39; \nGE 3 at 8; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 4.) \n1.b. Government account for overpayment of educational benefits placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $81. Applicant testified that she has actually paid \nthis debt several times in her attempts to have it removed from her credit report. In her \nAnswer she provided evidence of an $81 payment on August 17, 2021. She also provided \na record of a February 2021 payment she made of a second debt owed to the Government \nin the amount of $1,034. This larger payment was for a debt owed for an overpayment for \nhousing that was not alleged in the SOR. Both the debt at SOR 1.b and the larger, \nunalleged debt to the Government are resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 39-42, 58; GE 3 at \n8; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; GE 7.) \n1.c. Auto loan account charged off in the approximate amount of $33,953. \nApplicant opened this account in October 2016 and defaulted on the account after \nFebruary 2017. The creditor never repossessed the vehicle. Applicant states that she \nmade repeated attempts to contact someone at the creditor\u2019s office who would help her \nreturn the vehicle and resolve this debt, but was unsuccessful. In 2021 Applicant hired a \ncredit-repair company to address this debt. The creditor responded to the credit-repair \ncompany\u2019s correspondence that the debt was valid. She last spoke with someone at the \ncreditor\u2019s office later in 2021 and asked for instructions on what to do. The creditor never \ncalled her back. About a month prior to the hearing, Applicant had the credit-repair \ncompany write the creditor stating that she wanted to work out a payment arrangement \nfor this debt. The creditor never responded. The creditor had charged off the account and \nsold it to a collection agency. Applicant testified that she is prepared and able to pay at \nleast $1,000 per month to settle this debt and is committed to resolving this debt. After \nthe hearing, Applicant entered into a repayment plan with the collection agency. Under \nthe plan, she is obligated to pay $2,000 by December 1, 2022, and $998 per month for \nthe following 34 months by automatic payments from her bank account. Applicant \nprovided documentation evidencing her initial payment of $2,000 on November 18, 2022. \nThis debt is being resolved.

Fitness club account placed for collection in the approximate amount of $767. \nIn 2018 Applicant canceled her new club membership after living for one month in the city \nwhere the club was located. She deployed to a war zone at that time. She paid the early \ncancellation fee to the club.

The \nclub assigned the debt to a collection agency about the same time. During her background \ninterview in February 2021, she learned that the debt had not been deleted from her credit \nreport, dated September 3, 2020. The debt was subsequently deleted. It does not appear \nin the more recent credit reports in the record. This former debt was resolved several \nyears ago. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 55-60; GE 3 at 8; GE 5 at 4.) \n1.e. Auto loan account placed for collection in the approximate amount of $17,368. \nApplicant opened this account in 2010. Applicant defaulted on the loan payments in about \n2014, and the creditor placed the account for collection. She paid the debt off over five \nmonths, and by December 2014, she had finished paying this debt. The account appears \nin the Government\u2019s credit reports as \u201cpaid charge off\u201d and as \u201ccurrent.\u201d The record \ncontains no credit report that reflects that the account was delinquent. This former debt \nwas resolved many years ago. (Tr. at 43, 45-46, 52-55; GE 3 at 8; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 4.) \nMitigation \nApplicant explained that some of her oldest debts were the result of her decision \nto help her mother save her house from foreclosure and to assist her mother by making \nfurther mortgage payments. At a later point, Applicant helped her mother again by paying \nher medical bills. This caused Applicant to fall behind in paying some of her own debts. \nShe also explained that in 2018, she made a bad investment that negatively affected her \nfinances. She subsequently paid some of her debts and was surprised that the paid debts \nwere not removed from her credit report. Presently Applicant has $5,000 to $6,000 in \nsavings and earns a net monthly income of about $7,000. She does not live beyond her \nability to pay her bills. (Tr. at 25-27, 42-43, 52, 64-65.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owed approximately $53,000 for the five alleged \ndelinquent debts. The record evidence reflects that two of the debts alleged in the SOR \nwere delinquent as of the date of the SOR (SOR 1.b and 1.c). The Government\u2019s credit \nreports establish the existence of these debts and the application of the above potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate security \nconcerns under Guideline F. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could apply to the facts in \nthis case and mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nThe record evidence demonstrates that Applicant has responsibly managed her \ndelinquent debts resulting from her mother\u2019s financial situation, which caused Applicant \nto divert funds to help her mother avoid foreclosure on her home and later to pay her \nmedical bills. Applicant has repaid four of her outstanding debts and has entered into a \nrepayment agreement to fully repay her one remaining debt for a vehicle loan. Three of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthose debts were, in fact, paid years prior to the issuance of the SOR. She has stabilized \nher financial condition with the help of her financial advisor. There are clear indications \nthat her one remaining debt is being resolved. She substantially improved her financial \ncondition by deploying twice to war zones where she earned substantial income with \nlimited living expenses. Her past behavior does not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. All of the above mitigating conditions have application \nunder the facts of this case. Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations \nconcern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have given significant weight to Applicant\u2019s service \nto the U.S. Government as a contractor twice deployed to war zones, and the sacrifices \nand dangers that her work required. Her evidence in mitigation establishes that she has \nmade sincere efforts to repay her delinquent debts and to remove erroneous information \nfrom her credit record about debts that she paid in the past. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

(Item 10) \nApplicant reported real estate totaling $236,000 and $187,000; liquid assets of \n$1,924; a car valued at $15,000; a recreational vehicle for $8,000; with a total a value of \nnon-liquid assets in the amount of $446,000. He promised the investigator that he would \nprovide personal bank statements for the investigation, but he did not. (Item 10) \nPersonal Conduct \nAs to SOR 2.a, it was alleged that in March 18, 2018, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with Domestic Violence and Criminal Damage to Property. The charges were \ndismissed. Applicant admitted this allegation. \nAs to SOR 2.b, it was alleged that Applicant was investigated in April 2020 for \nCriminal Damage to Property and was referred for prosecution. Applicant denied this \nallegation as he filed charges against the victim. In addition, he wrote a statement \nregarding the person responsible. \nApplicant disclosed in his 2020 security clearance application that he was accused \nof domestic violence in 2018 due to an altercation with his cohabitant. He related she was \ndrinking and in the situation, he had broken a picture of his own. He pleaded innocent, \nwent to trial and case was dismissed because he was getting his girlfriend help with her \ndrinking disorder and also counseling. (Item 3) \nApplicant was investigated for property damage, but he volunteered during his \n2020 subject interview that his girlfriend had consumed a \u201clarge amount of alcohol.\u201d \nApplicant left the residence to de-escalate the situation and when he returned he \ndiscovered damage in the residence. Applicant made a walk-in report to the police and \nhis cohabitant was charged with criminal damage to property.

The Government conceded in its argument \nin the FORM that the record evidence does not support the allegation under SOR 2.b for \npersonal conduct. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and, \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) . \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant and his wife separated in 2016 and \nhe lost $40,000 of family income. He does not live with her and will get divorced. He has \nmany accounts on his 2020 credit bureau report that show he \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d (Item 5) \nHis earlier credit reports also show many accounts \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d (Item 9) \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. While Applicant\u2019s separation was a condition \nbeyond his control, he has not acted responsibly to address the resulting debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are established. Applicant responded to the SOR and \nprovided documentation of obtaining the services of a debt consolidation company. The \ndocumentation did not show all the accounts that were in the plan. but his debt has been \nreduced to $70,920. While this is not an insubstantial amount of money, he is gainfully \nemployed and has been paying his creditors. He has taken credit counseling. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR for lack of sufficient evidence and documentation. For these reasons, I find he has \nnot fully mitigated the security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged domestic violence charge and an investigation into \nCriminal Property damage the following disqualifying condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 16 (c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or   other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information.  \nApplicant admitted the domestic violence event. He was dealing with a woman who \nhad been drinking. He left the residence to de-escalate the issue. When he returned, he \nfound the residence damaged. He made a report to the police. Applicant disclosed the \nevent, he went to trial and the case was dismissed. His wife was charged with Criminal \nProperty Damage. \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s comments that therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is \nnot established. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to\nrecur; \n \n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, the Government has not \nprovided evidence to refute Applicant. The Government even conceded that SOR \nallegation was not supported by the evidence. There was no police record in the file. SOR \nAG 2.a and 2.b are found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, including his honorable military service, I conclude that \nApplicant is on a path toward financial solvency but has not established a sufficient track \nrecord. As to security concerns under personal conduct, Applicant has a favorable \noutcome. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1d-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information under the financial consideration \nguideline.

(Tr. 4, 6, 24-25; GE 1) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts (student loans, car debt, medical debt, and other consumer debts) totaling approximately $54,119. The debts are established by credit reports from September 2020, April 2021, June 2021, and July 2022; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator in October 2020; and his SOR response admissions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h). (GE 3, 5-8; Answer to SOR) Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about January 2011 to January 2017.

He was unemployed from October 2019 to \nFebruary 2020, February 2015 to January 2016, and March 2013 to October 2013. (Tr. \n4, 6, 24-25; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts (student loans, car \ndebt, medical debt, and other consumer debts) totaling approximately $54,119. The debts \nare established by credit reports from September 2020, April 2021, June 2021, and July \n2022; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator in October 2020; \nand his SOR response admissions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h). (GE 3, 5-8; Answer to SOR) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about January 2011 to January 2017. This allegation is established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to an investigator during his October 2020 PSI, his admissions in \nhis January 2021 security clearance application (SCA), and his admissions in his SOR \nresponse (SOR \u00b6 2.a). (GE 2-3; Answer to SOR) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material \nfacts in his August 2020 SCA when he failed to list his marijuana use, as described in \nSOR \u00b6 2.a, in Section 23 of the SCA. It also alleged that Applicant falsified material facts \nin his August 2020 and January 2021 SCAs when he failed to list his delinquent debts, \nas described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h, in Section 26 of the SCAs. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \u2013 3.c) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began after he finished school and received his \nassociate\u2019s degree and his certificate. He financed his education with student loans. He \nstated that at one time he had approximately $140,000 worth of student-loan debt. All but \napproximately $60,000 of it was forgiven because the school that funded the loans went \nout of business. He provided no corroboration for this assertion. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe history and current status of Applicant\u2019s student loans is as follows: His \nSeptember 2020 credit report reflects that a national student-loan-servicing company was \nassigned Applicant\u2019s student loans in April 2015, with a balance of $29,856. The date of \nlast activity is listed as May 2018. The status of the loans is listed as \u201cclosed\u201d and a \n\u201ccharged-off account.\u201d The credit report also reflects that the account was \u201cpurchased by \nanother lender.\u201d His most recent credit report from July 2022 still shows the loans as \ncharged off. This credit report also lists 15 other student loans in the name of a federal \nagency, with a total balance of approximately $59,648. None of these loans show a \u201cpast \ndue\u201d characterization on the credit report. Applicant stated that these loans are currently \ndeferred, although he was not sure of the reason for the deferment. Most likely, these \nstudent loans are deferred because of the Presidential Executive Order deferring all \nstudent-loan payments and interest accumulation because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThere is no evidence linking the SOR listed charged-off student loans with the 15 currently \ndeferred student loans. (Tr. 30-32, 48, 66; GE 5, 8)  \nApplicant claimed that the car debt list in SOR \u00b6 1.c was erroneous because he \nheld the title to the car. He did not produce documentation to corroborate that he \npossessed a free and clear title for the car. For all the remaining delinquent debts, \nApplicant claimed that he paid a debt repair company (DRC) approximately $3,000 in \nAugust 2020. Once he hired the DRC, he believed it would \u201cclean-up\u201d his debt. He was \nadvised by the DRC not to pay any of the debts so they would \u201cdrop off\u201d his credit report. \nAside from his one-time payment to the DRC, he has not made any payments toward his \nSOR debts. He stated that he would produce documentation showing his contractual \narrangement with the DRC. He did not do so. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g are based upon the \nsame underlying debt and therefore, I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.g. (Tr.24, 29-30, 41-\n42, 63, 68-69-70; GE 5) \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is between $50,000 and $60,000. He does not have any \nsavings currently. He is living in a recreational vehicle that his brother financed. He pays \nhis brother $800 per month to repay this loan. (Tr. 72, 74) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant admitted in his testimony that he used marijuana infrequently starting \nwhen his was about 22. He was not working for a federal contractor then. He knew it was \nillegal when he used it. He listed on his January 2021 SCA that he stopped using \nmarijuana in 2017, but he does not really recall the date. On cross-examination, he stated \nthat he had not used marijuana in the last two years. He understood that marijuana use \nis illegal under federal law and prohibited by federal contractor employees. His company \ndoes random drug testing and he was tested three times before he was hired. \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant failed to list his marijuana use under Section 23 of his August 2020 SCA. \nHe listed that activity when he completed his January 2021 SCA. He explained that the \nreason for his omission on his earlier SCA was because he was not at his home when he \nwas completing it, and he did not have access to records that would have helped him \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nremember his activities seven years back.

When he completed the second SCA in January 2021, he was \nat his home location. He also contacted people at work and asked about this question, \nand he was told to list his marijuana use on the SCA. I did not find Applicant\u2019s explanation \ncredible. (Tr. 33-35; GE 1-2) \nApplicant also failed to list his delinquent debts on either of his SCAs when asked \nto do so in Section 26 of each one. Applicant explained that he did not list the debts on \nhis SCAs because he had hired the DRC and believed his debts were being resolved. He \nadmitted on cross-examination that he was asked about his debts and made aware of \ntheir delinquent status when he was interviewed by an investigator in October 2020. He \nclaimed he had no intent to deceive the government about his debt status. I did not find \nApplicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 40-42, 61; GE 1-2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred eight delinquent debts, including student loans, a car debt, and \nconsumer debts. While Applicant was unable to pay the debts at certain times, he also \nhired a DRC and was advised not to pay certain debts so they would fall off his credit \nreport. The evidence establishes that the SOR-related student loans were charged off in \n2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. Although President Biden extended a \npause on the collection of federal student loans due to COVID-19, thus creating a \ndeferment period on federal student-loan payments, that action does not excuse \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s previously delinquent student loans. (See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. \nBd. June 7, 2021). I find that all of the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and he has not made any \npayments toward them. His inaction towards resolving his debts casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment are conditions beyond his control. However, \nhis decision to follow the advice of the DRC and not pay his debts was a choice he made. \nAdditionally, he did not act responsibly concerning his debts when he decided to follow \nthat advice, and when he chose not to make payments on any of his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \nnot fully applicable. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling, other than hiring a DRC. \nAdditionally, he stated that his plan to deal with his debts was to do nothing\u2014in other \nwords\u2014he plans to let them fall off his credit report. While this may be an appropriate \noption to take viewed through a financial prism, it does not equate to acting responsibly \nand in good faith and puts into question his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not present documentary evidence to support his dispute of SOR \u00b6 1.d. AG \n\u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One condition is potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n(a) any substance misuse. \nApplicant used marijuana on several occasions from 2011 to 2017. I find AG \u00b6 \n25(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. One potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant used marijuana on a limited basis and ceased using it in approximately \n2017. He has not been involved with any drug activity since 2019. His years of abstinence, \nhis understanding that marijuana use is illegal under federal law, and his willingness to \nabide by that is sufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s intent not to use marijuana in the \nfuture. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information.

Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national.  \nI did not find Applicant\u2019s explanations for why he failed to list his prior drug \ninvolvement on his 2020 SCA or his delinquent debts on either of his SCAs credible. \nReasonable inferences from the evidence support that he failed to list this information \nintentionally. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nApplicant did not make a prompt good-faith effort to correct his omissions. \nProviding false information on a SCA is not a minor offense, but rather goes to the heart \nof the security clearance review process. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F, H, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment. However, I also considered that \nhe did not attempt to pay his debts or take any other action to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. He has not established a meaningful track record of debt management, and his \nplan to let his debts fall off his credit report causes me to question his reliability and \nwillingness to resolve his debts in the future. While he mitigated his drug activity, his \nfailure to list his drug use on his first SCA and his delinquent debts on both SCAs also \nraises questions about his reliability and trustworthiness. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations or personal conduct security \nconcerns, but he mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.f, 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph: 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph: 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 3.a-3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On June 9, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn August 13, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have her \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 27, 2021, and she was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.

Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a passport support supervisor with her current employer since December 2016. She \nwas previously employed by other employers as a part-time supervisor (February 2014 \u2013 \nDecember 2016); a full-time driver coordinator (September 2010 \u2013 February 2014); and \na full-time administrative assistant (September 2009 \u2013 September 2010). She is a 2008 \nhigh school graduate. She received college credits during the periods 2009 - 2011, and \nin 2015, but no degree. In 2020, she reenrolled in college. She has never served with the \nU.S. military. She has never held a security clearance.  She has never been married.  \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated August 13, 2021); \nItem 3 (SF 86, dated July 7, 2016); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 5, 2021); \nItem 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated April 21, \n2020); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated February 7, 2020); and Item 7 (Enhanced \nSubject Interview, dated May 7, 2020). \nIn her SF 86, Applicant denied having any financial issues. (Item 3 at 28-29) \nHowever, a review of her credit reports from 2020 \u2013 2021 indicates that there are several \nsuch issues. On May 7, 2020, she was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, she acknowledged that she had \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseveral accounts, especially student-loan accounts, that had been delinquent, but that \nshe was now enrolled in a payment plan \u2013 originally calling for an $86 monthly payment, \nthat was subsequently reduced to a $60 monthly payment. (Item 7 at 3) The investigator \nasked her on several occasions to furnish supporting financial documentation, and she \npromised to do so, but eventually his requests were ignored by her. (Item 7 at 3-6) In her \nAnswer to the SOR, she acknowledged her delinquent student-loan accounts and stated \nthat they had been attached to her debit card for direct monthly payments, but she had \nlost the card during travel outside the country. (Item 2 at 1) She failed to offer any \nexplanations as to when she resolved the issues of the lost debit card. Furthermore, she \nfailed to submit any verifiable documentary evidence to support her comments regarding \npayment plans, payments, or the lost debit card. \nApplicant attributed her financial issues to four factors: (1) she was just getting out \non her own and was still learning how to manage her debts; (2) when the student loans \nwere opened, the process was done by her parents, and nobody ever informed her that \nshe would have to repay the loans; (3) she had a general lack of sufficient income; and \n(4) she was prioritizing other bills before making student-loan payments. She never \nidentified which other bills took priority over her student-loan accounts. Nevertheless, now \nthat she was made aware of the issues, she intends to pay all of her debts. (Item 7 at 5) \nDespite having insufficient funds to pay her delinquent debts, in December 2019, \nApplicant took a five-day vacation to France. (Item 7 at 3) \nThe SOR alleged nine still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $39,665, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f., and 1.h. are student-loan accounts with unpaid balances \nof $11,270; $7,779; $5,065; $4,943; $3,905; $2,309; and $1,794 that were placed for \ncollection and transferred between the lender, servicing agent, and eventually with the \nU.S. Department of Education. (Item 4 at 3-5; Item 5 at 9-13; Item 6 at 2; and Item 7 at 3-\n5) Despite Applicant\u2019s contentions that a repayment plan covering all of the accounts was \npreviously established, \u201cplaced on pause\u201d for non-payment, and modified, and that \npayments were now being made, she failed to submit any documents to support such \ncontentions. The account is not yet being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a charge account with a furniture store with an unpaid balance of \n$2,268 that was placed for collection. (Item 5 at 12; Item 6 at 2; and Item 7 at 4) During \nher OPM interview, Applicant claimed that she has been making periodic payments of \nbetween $80 and $100 without a formal repayment plan, and that she intended to enter \ninto a formal repayment plan. (Item 7 at 4). However, in her Answer to the SOR, she \nclaimed to be unaware of the collection, but indicated that she would investigate it in order \nto resolve it. (Item 2 at 1) The combination of Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements and the \nabsence of any documentation to support the contentions that payments were being \nmade leads to the conclusion that the account is not yet being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $332 that was placed \nfor collection and $475 was charged off in March 2020. (Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 12-13; Item \n6 at 2; and Item 7 at 4) Applicant claimed she paid off the bill, but while she failed to \n---\n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfurnish proof of such payment, one of the Government exhibits does, in fact, support her \ncontention, stating that the individual paid the charge off. (Item 5 at 13) Since that \nparticular credit report was issued in April 2020, I have concluded that the payment was \nmade over one year before the SOR was issued. The account has been resolved. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. She did not report her net monthly \nincome, her monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments. In May 2020, \nthe OPM investigator asked her to provide a financial statement detailing her income, \nassets, and expenses, but she failed to do so. In the absence of such information, I am \nunable to determine if she has any monthly remainder available for savings or spending. \nThere is a paucity of evidence to indicate that her financial problems are now under \ncontrol, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially \nthan she had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no \nevidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy her debts regardless of an ability to \ndo so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nIn the absence of documentary or otherwise evidence to verify that Applicant took \nany positive action to resolve her delinquent charge account or student-loan accounts, \nnone of the conditions apply. As noted above, Applicant identified four factors for the \nreasons she was not proactive or successful in addressing her accounts: (1) she was just \ngetting out on her own and was still learning how to manage her debts; (2) when the \nstudent loans were opened, the process was done by her parents, and nobody ever \ninformed her that she would have to repay the loans; (3) she had a general lack of \nsufficient income; and (4) she was prioritizing other bills before making student-loan \npayments. Although she was employed without interruption since 2009, and took college \nclasses from 2009 through 2011, and again in 2015 \u2013 supported by student loans \u2013 to \nthis day, she has not earned her degree. Instead, she has made claims of positive \nresolution action, but when repeatedly requested to furnish the documentation to support \nher claims, she avoided doing so. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Although Applicant claimed that she had been making a \nvariety of payments to her creditors, she offered no verifiable evidence of a good-faith \neffort to support any of those claims. It is noted that she paid off one charged-off account \n\u2013 the one for $475 (and alleged as only $332) \u2013 before she was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in early May 2020, but between that interview and the date her response to \nthe FORM was expected in December 2021, she made no verifiable efforts to address \nany other delinquent debts, including her student loans. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored her delinquent \naccounts for a substantial multi-year period. Because of her failure to confirm any student-\nloan payments and her failure to furnish documentation regarding any of the accounts, \nthe overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that her financial problems are not \nunder control. She has not acted responsibly by failing to address her delinquent accounts \nwhile employed and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with her creditors. \nThe Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.

(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has failed to offer any documentary evidence that she has even \nbegun making such efforts even after the SOR was issued in June 2021. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered no specifics \nregarding any repayment efforts; submitted no documentary evidence to reflect any \npayments made; and only made promises of proposed actions. Not one delinquent debt \nhas been resolved since the SOR was issued. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current financial \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s in-action under the circumstances casts doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \npassport support supervisor with her current employer since December 2016. She was \npreviously employed by other employers as a part-time supervisor; a full-time driver \ncoordinator; and a full-time administrative assistant. She is a 2008 high school graduate. \nShe received college credits during the periods 2009 - 2011, and in 2015, but no degree. \nIn 2020, she reenrolled in college. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant had nine still-delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $39,665. She identified four factors for the reasons she was not proactive \nor successful in addressing her accounts: (1) she was just getting out on her own and \nwas still learning how to manage her debts; (2) when the student loans were opened, the \nprocess was done by her parents, and nobody ever informed her that she would have to \nrepay the loans; (3) she had a general lack of sufficient income; and (4) she was \nprioritizing other bills before making student-loan payments. Although she was employed \nwithout interruption since 2009, and took college classes from 2009 through 2011, and \nagain in 2015 \u2013 supported by student loans \u2013 to this day, she has not earned her degree. \nInstead, she has made claims of positive resolution action, but when repeatedly \nrequested to furnish the documentation to support her claims, she avoided doing so. \nDespite having insufficient funds to pay her delinquent debts, in December 2019, \nApplicant took a five-day vacation to France. \nThere are lingering questions if Applicant is currently in a better position financially \nthan she had been. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Her repeated \nrefusal to furnish requested financial documentation merely adds to those questions and \ndoubts. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from her financial considerations.

His request for a clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 20, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not affirmatively determine that it \nis clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance.

The guideline cited in the SOR is among the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Applicant timely responded to \nthe SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nThe case was assigned to me on October 25, 2021. I scheduled a hearing to be \nheld on March 31, 2022, via online video teleconferencing. The parties appeared as \nscheduled, and Applicant testified in his own behalf. Department Counsel proffered \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 3. Additionally, a copy of a discovery letter dated \nSeptember 3, 2021, was included in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1. I received a \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 8, 2022. \nApplicant testified but did not produce any documents at hearing. At the end of the \nhearing, as discussed during the hearing, I held the record open to receive documentary \ninformation in support of his case. (Tr. 79) He timely submitted Applicant Exhibit (AX) A, \na two-page document pertaining to one of the debts alleged in the SOR. The record \nclosed on April 11, 2022, when I received Department Counsel\u2019s waiver of objection to \nthe admissibility of AX A. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $42,929 for 11 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.k). In his Answer, Applicant admitted with \nexplanations allegations at SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.i \u2013 1.k. He denied with explanations \nthe remaining SOR allegations. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old and is being sponsored for a security clearance by a \ndefense contractor, which has hired him contingent on his ability to obtain a security \nclearance. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force between July 1992 \nand September 2017, when he retired. His last assignment in the military was overseas, \nand he remained there as a civilian employee at a U.S. military base. While in the military, \nApplicant held a security clearance, which has since lapsed. (GX 1; Tr. 22) \nApplicant and his wife have been married since March 2013. He previously was \nmarried between 1992 and 2002, and between January 2003 and May 2011. Both prior \nmarriages ended by divorce. He has six children, ages 28, 25, 20, 18, 6, and 5, and a 21-\nyear-old stepchild. His two youngest children and the 21-year-old live with Applicant and \nhis wife, and he pays $850 in monthly court-ordered child support for the 18-year-old who \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlives with that child\u2019s mother; however, he testified that his child support obligation will \nend now that the child has reached the age of majority. He has not yet petitioned the court \nto terminate the child support order. Applicant has always been current on his child-\nsupport payments as it has always been deducted from his active duty pay or from his \nretired pay each month. (GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 29 \u2013 32) \nApplicant\u2019s current wife is a foreign national whom he met and married while \nstationed overseas. His stepchild, also a foreign national, is his wife\u2019s daughter from a \nprevious relationship. When Applicant retired from the military, he and his family had \nplanned to remain overseas where he was working on a U.S. military installation. \nHowever, during a 2017 visit to see Applicant\u2019s elderly parents, it became apparent that \nhe should move back to the United States to care for them. His mother died in 2021. His \nfather is in his late seventies and requires the level of care and attention one might expect \nfor someone that age. Fortunately, his father is financially self-sufficient and has medical \ninsurance that covers most of his needs. (GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 32 \u2013 33) \nApplicant and his family moved to the United States in June 2017. He did not yet \nhave a job and was unemployed until December 2017, when he was hired in a managerial \nposition for a national department store chain at an annual salary of $50,000. This salary \nwas sufficient to support his family; however, he was soon required to travel as part of his \nduties and found that he actually was losing income because of travel-related expenses. \nA subsequent reorganization caused Applicant to leave that job in late 2019 and take his \ncurrent managerial position with a nationally-known retail company. His net monthly \nincome is about $3,470. He also receives monthly military retired pay of about $580 after \nchild support is deducted (this should increase to about $1,430 when that obligation \nends), and he receives about $1,740 each month in disability benefits from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA). Additionally, Applicant\u2019s wife started working full \ntime in October 2021 and brings home an additional $1,000 each month. (GX 3; Tr. 22 \u2013 \n29, 66 \u2013 67) \nIn his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed the debts at SOR 1.a, 1.f, and 1.k. The February \n2021 credit report introduced by Department Counsel documents all of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. Those debts were discussed with and confirmed by Applicant during a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator on February 27, 2021. \nDuring the PSI, Applicant stated his intentions to contact his creditors and repay or \notherwise resolve his debts. Through AX A, he established that in November 2021, he \nresolved the debt at SOR 1.c through a monthly payment plan he initiated after he \nreceived the SOR. Although he also claims he also paid the debt at SOR 1.j, a delinquent \nutility bill from his residence overseas, he did not provide any information to document \nthat payment. The remaining debts alleged have not yet been satisfied and any efforts by \nApplicant to communicate with his creditors were initiated after he received the SOR six \nmonths after his PSI. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX A; Tr. 41 \u2013 44, 51 \u2013 52) \nApplicant disputed some of the debts alleged. Available information shows that the \ndebt at SOR 1.a is for the remainder after resale of a vehicle, purchased in 2018, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntwice repossessed in 2019. The first repossession occurred when he fell behind on his \npayments in February 2019. After bringing the loan current, he again fell behind; however, \nhe claimed that he stopped making full payments after the terms of the loan were changed \nunexpectedly, increasing his payment from $661 to $800. The dealer/lender increased \nthe monthly payment to cover mandatory car insurance after Applicant let his policy lapse. \nApplicant argued that he did not let the policy lapse and that he should have been told \nabout the change in the terms of the loan. He last contacted that creditor more than a \nyear before the hearing and he has not made any payments or other arrangements to \nresolve the debt. He also did not support his claims regarding the car insurance and \nchange of payment terms despite having additional time after the hearing. (Answer; GX \n1 \u2013 3; Tr. 34 \u2013 39) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant claimed he was making payments to satisfy the \ndelinquent cellphone account debt alleged at SOR 1.b. He did not corroborate that claim \nat or after his hearing. He testified that the debt is for equipment he did not return when \nhe changed service providers. The delinquent cable, phone, and internet provider debt at \nSOR 1.e also resulted from his failure to return equipment when he changed service \nproviders. Applicant has not paid either debt, and he did not show that he has returned \nany of the equipment or that he is communicating with either creditor to resolve these \ndebts. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 39 \u2013 41, 45 \u2013 46) \nApplicant has claimed that the delinquent credit card debt alleged at SOR 1.d is \nthe result of someone misusing his card. When asked about this account during his PSI, \nhe stated that he would not pay any charges with which he disagreed, which he estimates \ntotal about $1,100 of the $1,813 listed in the credit report obtained by investigators in \nFebruary 2021. Applicant did not present any information to support this dispute or that \nshows he has made any payments on this debt. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 44 \u2013 45) \nApplicant testified that he thinks the debt at SOR 1.f was resolved when he paid \nthe debt at SOR 1.c. The basis for his claim is that the creditor listed in SOR 1.f is the \nsame as SOR 1.c; however, the creditor listed is a collection agency that likely collects \nfor a variety of businesses. Applicant did not corroborate his claim that he has resolved \nthe SOR 1.f debt, which is for a past-due furniture rental account. He also disputes the \ndebt, claiming the furniture was defective and the creditor did not make required repairs. \nHe did not produce any information to corroborate this claim. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. \n47 \u2013 49) \nAs to the SOR 1.g and 1.h debts being collected by the same creditor, Applicant \ndoes not know who the creditor is or what the debts are for. The debts are documented \nin the February 2021 credit report, and he told the investigator during his PSI that he \nwould contact the creditor to determine the accuracy of those entries. Applicant has not \nprovided any further information about those efforts and the debts remain unresolved. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 49 \u2013 50) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant disputes the debt at SOR 1.i as a bill that should have been covered by \nhis medical insurance. However, it remains unpaid and he did not provide information in \nsupport of his dispute. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 51) \nThe debt at SOR 1.k is the remainder after resale of a car, purchased in 2017, that \nwas repossessed in April 2019. Not long after he bought the car, he let his niece use it \nwith the understanding that she would make the required monthly payments. In early \n2019, he became aware that the car loan, which was in his name only, was past due by \nas much as $1,200. Applicant paid that arrearage to retrieve the car, but his niece did not \nmake any more loan payments and the car was repossessed when the loan was another \n$6,000 in arrears. Applicant has not acted to resolve this debt. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 52 \n\u2013 55) \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to his brief period of unemployment in \n2017, to the reduction in income he experienced when he retired, to uneven income in \nthe United States, to unplanned legal expenses, and to having to pay for his mother\u2019s \nfuneral. His wife and stepdaughter entered the United States on tourist visas because \nthey did not initially plan to remain. Thereafter, they had to apply for permanent resident \nalien (PRA) status. Between 2017 and 2021, he paid almost $7,000 for legal services \nneeded to obtain their \u201cgreen cards.\u201d That process was successfully completed in late \n2021; however, he cited those expenses as factors that either have hindered his ability to \nresolve his past-due debts or caused him to fall behind on his various obligations after \n2017. When his mother died last year, he paid about $7,000 for her funeral. (GX 1; GX 3; \nTr. 22 \u2013 29, 33 \u2013 34, 78) \nApplicant lives paycheck to paycheck despite having about $400 remaining each \nmonth after regular expenses. He did not provide any detailed information, such as a \nmonthly budget, about the way he and his wife manage their finances. He has not sought \nany assistance from a financial professional or a credit counseling firm to help him resolve \nhis debts. (Tr. 59 \u2013 64) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n5 \n\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport all of the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past due or \ndelinquent debt that, with one exception, is still outstanding. This information reasonably \nraises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAfter a thorough review of this record, I conclude that none of these mitigating \nconditions can be applied. In response to the Government\u2019s prima facie case for \ndisqualification, Applicant showed that only the debt at SOR 1.c has been addressed. All \nof the remaining debts listed in the SOR are still unresolved. Accordingly, his financial \nproblems are recent and continuing. It may be that Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose \nthrough the unexpected circumstance of having to return to the United States to care for \nhis parents; however, the record does not support a conclusion that he acted responsibly \ngiven those circumstances. His debts remained unaddressed even after he was \ninterviewed by a government investigator in early 2021. It was not until he received the \nSOR that he took any action at all by repaying the SOR 1.c debt. Despite having additional \ntime after his hearing, he did not present information to support his claims that he is \nrepaying the debt at SOR 1.b or that he repaid the debt at SOR 1.j. Nor did he support \nhis disputes with various other creditors. As to his two largest debts, Applicant has not \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntaken any measureable action in the past year that would indicate he will be able to pay \nor otherwise resolve them. \nApplicant has not sought any professional financial assistance in addressing his \nfinancial problems. Further, he did not present any useful or encouraging information that \nshows he manages his personal finances in a way that would help him avoid such \nfinancial problems in the future. On balance, I conclude Applicant has not met his burden \nof persuasion and that he has not mitigated the security concerns established by the \nGovernment\u2019s information. I also have considered the potential application of AG \u00b6 20(e). \nThe record evidence as a whole presents significant remaining doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Because protection of the national interest \nis the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from a number of conditions that were \nbeyond his control: a costly nine-year custody battle; his wife\u2019s significant medical and \nmental health issues; his brother-in-law\u2019s unexpected passing; and the sexual and \nemotional abuse perpetrated upon his children. \nApplicant went through trying times. He did not seek a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to \navoid paying his debts. He filed a Chapter 13 wage earner\u2019s bankruptcy case that will \nenable him to pay his creditors an amount that the bankruptcy court deems appropriate \nfor his situation. He made 15 payments of about $1,750 between July 2021 and August \n2022, for a total amount paid during that period of $26,285.   \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances and made a good-faith \neffort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast doubt on his current judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), \nand 20(d) are applicable. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D, AE F) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), and 22(c). Applicant was involved \nin two domestic disputes in 2016 and 2020 after consuming alcohol. He admitted the \nNovember 2020 arrest occurred after he had consumed alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists three conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program. \nApplicant presented information supporting his positive work performance.

He has abstained from consuming \nalcohol for one year, and he is motivated not to engage in future illegal conduct. He has \ntaken responsible action by changing his lifestyle. Future alcohol-related problems are \nunlikely to occur and do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. Guideline G security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two potentially apply: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn June 2016, Applicant and his spouse were involved in a domestic dispute where \nhe simulated stabbing his wife with a kitchen knife to end the argument. Although he was \nnot charged with a criminal offense, Applicant acknowledged his behavior was extremely \noffensive and inappropriate. A protective order was issued and his firearms were \nconfiscated by police. \nIn November 2020, Applicant and his spouse were involved in a domestic dispute \nwhich escalated to physical abuse by Applicant. His wife suffered a fractured nose, and \nhe was charged with a felony and two misdemeanor assault offenses for his criminal \nconduct. This pattern of conduct raises concerns about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is disconcerting and recent. He was convicted and \nsentenced to 60 days in jail with 18 months of probation. He is required to complete a \ndomestic violence program and pay restitution of $3,650. Applicant did not submit any \nevidence of rehabilitation, such as proof that he has fulfilled all of the court-ordered \nconditions, or that he is no longer on probation. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s violent \nconduct will not recur. I find that more time is needed to ensure that he does not repeat \nhis violent behavior in the event he encounters a stressful situation. As such, his criminal \nbehavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation under the above mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J into my whole-person analysis. \nIn 2016 and 2020, Applicant was involved in two serious domestic disputes after \nconsuming alcohol. To his credit, he has abstained from drinking alcohol for the past year \nand has made positive lifestyle changes. About nine days after the security clearance \nhearing concluded, Applicant pled guilty to allegations related to domestic violence. Not \nenough time has passed to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s violent behavior will not recur, \nand there is insufficient evidence in the record to show that he successfully fulfilled all of \nthe sentence requirements set by the court. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Although he mitigated the alcohol consumption security \nconcerns, Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under criminal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility is denied. \nPamela Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528,\n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information shows that Applicant owes more than $100,000 for eight \ndelinquent debts that she has not yet addressed or resolved. Her debts arose, in part, \nbecause she was living beyond her means. This information reasonably raises the \nsecurity concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe Government\u2019s information presents a prima facie case for disqualification. \nAccordingly, it was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient reliable information on \nwhich application of available mitigating conditions could be based. She did not do so. \nThe record does not support any of the cited mitigating conditions. Applicant did not meet \nher burden of persuasion to overcome the Government\u2019s case for disqualification from \naccess to classified information. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d).

Applicant testified on his own behalf. He asked that the record remain \nopen for the receipt of additional documentation. No further information was provided, \nand the record closed on November 12, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 39 years old and single. He has a fianc\u00e9e; with whom he has two \nchildren.

(Government Exhibit 2 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17; Tr. 22-23, \n35-37.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant \nadmitted all the allegations under this guideline. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 29 debts that are charged-off, or in collection, \nin the total amount of approximately $44,588.

(Government Exhibits 1, 2, 3, and 4.) \nApplicant testified that all of these debts were related to consumer spending over \nthe past several years. The records show that many of these delinquent debts have been \ndue and owing for at least three or four years, if not longer. Applicant testified that he is \nable to maintain his payments on his current indebtedness, albeit occasionally late. \nHowever, Applicant has been unable to pay or otherwise resolve any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR due to other commitments on his funds, primarily student loans and other \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommercial accounts. Government Exhibit 3 shows that Applicant has over $100,000 in \nvarious kinds of debt. Applicant\u2019s ultimate aim is to pay all of his past-due indebtedness. \n(Government Exhibits 2 and 3; Tr. 23-25, 28-36.) \nApplicant testified that he went through a period of under-employment while he \nwas going to school between 2015 and 2019. During that period, he was employed in GI \nBill work-study programs that did not pay well. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Tr. \n29-30.) \nApplicant was in communication with a financial advisor connected to a veteran-\noriented, non-profit financial institution. The financial advisor set forth a roadmap for \nApplicant to follow in attempting to resolve some of his debts. Despite his best efforts, \nApplicant has been unable to take the financial advisor\u2019s advice. (Answer; Attachment; \nTr. 24-28.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant has incurred over $44,000 in past-due indebtedness over the past \nseveral years. He has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR, nor does he have \nany current plans to do so. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant. He failed to submit any evidence that would tend to support any of them. \nWhile there is some evidence that he was underemployed at some point, there is no \nevidence that the behavior was involuntary, or that he has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He has consulted with a financial advisor, but has been unable to follow \nthat person\u2019s advice in relation to paying his past-due indebtedness. There is no basis for \nme to find that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nsituation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns over his considerable past-due indebtedness. Overall, the record evidence \ncreates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.cc: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted the allegation in the SOR. I adopt his admission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Item 3) Applicant is 35 years old. He is single, never married. He has worked as a quality specialist for his current employer, a federal contractor, since 2020. He received a high school diploma in 2005. He honorably served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2007 to 2015. He held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps. (Items 4-6) The SOR alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his August 2020 SCA when he answered that he had used marijuana from June 2003 to December 2019 and that he intended to use marijuana in the future, when in actuality he had not used marijuana since 2007 and he had no intentions of using it in the future. (Item 1) Applicant listed his uses of marijuana as alleged above in his August 2020 SCA. He also stated that in the SCA that he intended to use marijuana in the future. In an earlier SCA from April 2012, that he completed while in the Marine Corps, he denied any uses of illegal drugs, including marijuana within the last seven years.

The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 13, 2021, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

(Items 1-3 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information.) The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on April \n29, 2022. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not file any objections or submit any \nadditional evidence. Items 4-6 are admitted into evidence without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on August 4, 2022. \nProcedural Ruling \nIn the body of the FORM, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add \na second allegation under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The allegation in substance would \nbe that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his use of marijuana from 2003 to 2007 \non his April 11, 2012 security clearance application (SCA). As noted above, the FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant on March 9, 2022. Applicant signed as receiving the package \non April 29, 2022. There is no evidence that Applicant read the FORM to make himself \naware of the proposed additional allegation. This contrasts from his receipt of the SOR \nwhere he clearly reviewed the original SOR allegation as signified by his written \nadmission to it (See Item 3). Therefore, because of procedural due process concerns \nover whether Applicant received actual notice of the added allegation, and out of an \nabundance of caution, I am denying Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend. However, \nwhile I will not consider the evidence applying to the proposed amended allegation for \ndisqualification purposes, I will consider it as it may relate to the application of any \nmitigating conditions and during my whole-person assessment. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted the allegation in the SOR. I adopt his \nadmission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Item 3) \nApplicant is 35 years old. He is single, never married. He has worked as a quality \nspecialist for his current employer, a federal contractor, since 2020. He received a high \nschool diploma in 2005. He honorably served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps \nfrom 2007 to 2015. He held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps. (Items 4-6) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his August 2020 SCA when \nhe answered that he had used marijuana from June 2003 to December 2019 and that \nhe intended to use marijuana in the future, when in actuality he had not used marijuana \nsince 2007 and he had no intentions of using it in the future. (Item 1) \nApplicant listed his uses of marijuana as alleged above in his August 2020 SCA. \nHe also stated that in the SCA that he intended to use marijuana in the future. In an \nearlier SCA from April 2012, that he completed while in the Marine Corps, he denied \nany uses of illegal drugs, including marijuana within the last seven years.

Applicant admitted that he \nlied on his 2020 SCA about his prior marijuana uses. He clarified that he had not used \nillegal drugs, including marijuana, since 2007 when he joined the Marine Corps. He \nfurther explained that he lied about using marijuana from 2008 to 2019 because he \ndecided he did not want to be considered for a security clearance. He believed that if he \ngave disqualifying information, such as recent illegal drug use, he would not be \nconsidered for a security clearance. He went on to tell the investigator that he regretted \nhis decision to lie about his drug use. He restated that he has not used any illegal drugs \nsince he was approximately 20 years old and before he was a Marine. (Item 6) \nIn June 2021, Applicant answered interrogatories as part of the adjudicative \nprocess for his clearance. He was again asked to explain his reason for lying on his \nAugust 2020 SCA about using marijuana beyond 2007. He stated that he was not \nhappy with his job and thought if he could get disqualified from having a clearnce he \nmight also be \u201clet go\u201d by his employer, thereby allowing him to collect unemployment \nuntil the Covid pandemic was over. His disqualifier would be his fictitious drug use after \n2007. (Item 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple admissions to deliberately providing false information on his \nAugust 2020 SCA about his marijuana use from 2007 to 2019 satisfy this disqualifying \ncondition. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and   \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.  \nApplicant\u2019s background \ninterview \nwas conducted in September 2020, \napproximately one month after he completed his 2020 SCA. The summarized interview \nprepared by the investigator is not dispositive on whether Applicant was confronted with \nhis false information on his SCA. The interview summary just states: \u201cDRUG \nINVOLVEMENT: Subject discussed Subject\u2019s drug involvement.\u201d Since an applicant has \nthe burden to establish mitigating conditions, Applicant did not meet that burden here. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nDeliberately providing false information on a SCA is not a minor offense and it \noccurred as recently as 2020. Additionally, the evidence established that this is not the \nfirst time Applicant provided false information on a SCA. He also did so on his 2012 \nSCA when he failed to disclose his 2005-2007 drug use. Multiple occasions of Applicant \nproviding deliberate false information on his SCAs casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant acknowledged his behavior by admitting his past falsification \nand expressing remorse, he failed to provide any information that shows he has taken \npositive steps to change that behavior. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that \nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. However, I also considered that he lied about using marijuana for his own \npersonal agenda. He previously lied about his marijuana use on an earlier SCA. He has \ndemonstrated he is willing to falsify documents if he believes it will benefit his own self-\ninterests. I note that because he chose to have his case decided on the written record, \nwithout a hearing, I was unable to observe his demeanor or make any findings on his \ncredibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph    1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, \n1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix \nA the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F and E.

(GE 3 at 21, 25; AE B) \nOn March 8, 2021, Applicant filed his federal income tax return for TY 2019. (GE \n3 at 15) His AGI was $69,200; his federal income tax was $8,400; and on April 12, 2021, \nthe IRS notified him that he owed about $800 for TY 2019. A note written on the IRS \nnotice indicates the debt was paid on June 9, 2021. (Id.; AE A at 23/) Applicant\u2019s monthly \ngross income is about $11,500. (Tr. 31; AE A at 19) His monthly net remainder is about \n$5,000. (Tr. 33-34) He has about $19,000 in his savings account. (Tr. 34) He is investing \nin real estate.

(AE B) He did not establish that he filed his federal or \nstate income tax returns or paid his federal and state taxes for TYs 2017 and 2018. (AE \nB) \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant was focused on his mother\u2019s health because she suffered from cancer \nfor about 30 months, and he was not thinking about taxes. (Tr. 29-30) Applicant returned \nfrom overseas in 2017, and his mother died in February 2018.

(GE 3 at 11, 14) \nApplicant said his failure to disclose that he had not filed his TYs 2017 and 2018 \nfederal and state tax returns on his SCA was due to being unaware that his tax returns \nwere not filed.

(AE A at 16) While in the \nAir Force, he completed four years and nine months of foreign service and numerous \ntraining courses. (AE A at 16) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal \nBoard explained: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Additional discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in \nthe mitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant paid or brought the two debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b to current status. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are mitigated. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for TYs 2017, 2018, \nand 2019. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as crimes. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nApplicant provided some important evidence of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g) \nbecause he filed his FY 2019 federal tax return, and he paid his overdue federal taxes for \nthat tax year in 2021. The death of his mother in 2018, his deployment overseas, and his \ndivorce in 2019 contributed to his failure to timely file his tax returns for TYs 2017 and \n2018. Applicant did not provide IRS tax transcripts or copies of his federal income tax \nreturns for TYs 2017 and 2018, and I conclude he has not proven that he filed his federal \nand state tax returns for those two years. He did not provide copies of any \ncorrespondence sent to the IRS or his employers seeking copies of IRS income \ntranscripts or W-2s. He did not prove that he was unable to make greater progress sooner \nfiling his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018. Applicant failed to \nestablish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a trustworthiness concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one condition that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.  \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). The Appeal Board indicated: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. Additionally, the Appeal Board gives \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019). \nApplicant admitted that he erred when he failed to disclose his failure to file his \nstate and federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018. His explanation for not \ndisclosing this information was his reliance on his spouse to file those tax returns. He \nmistakenly believed her when she said their tax returns were filed. I find Applicant\u2019s denial \nof intent to deceive the Government about filing his federal and state tax returns for TYs \n2017, 2018, and 2019 to be credible. Personal conduct security concerns are refuted. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old supervisor of structures technicians. He has about 100 \ncollege credits. He served in the Air Force from 1989 to 2015. His first nine years were \non active duty, and the remainder was in the National Guard and Reserve. He was a staff \nsergeant when he honorably retired from the Air Force. He received multiple awards and \ncitations while he was in the Air Force. He was married from 1999 to 2019, and his two \nchildren are ages 10 and 19. Applicant is currently working overseas. \nApplicant has sufficient financial resources to pay his debts, including his taxes. \nThe only area of financial irresponsibility is his history of failing to timely file his federal \nand state income tax returns for TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019. I have credited him with filing \nhis federal and state tax returns for TY 2019, and with paying his taxes for that tax year. \nI am confident that he will diligently work to timely file his future tax returns. However, this \nis insufficient to establish full mitigation at this time. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated\u201d). \nSee also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a \nsecurity clearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the \nFederal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d). \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a case where the applicant \nfiled his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and his 2012 tax return in \nAugust 2015 all before the SOR was issued. The applicant in that case owed less than \n$1,800 in federal income taxes for those four TYs at the time of the decision. Id. The \nAppeal Board found the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be an important factor \nstating: \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission \nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background \ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the \ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that \nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies.

Like the applicant in \nISCR Case No. 15-03481, he did not establish he was unable to make greater progress \nsooner in the resolution of his tax issues. His actions under the Appeal Board \njurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. He refuted personal conduct security concerns; however, \nunmitigated financial considerations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of \na security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. He is single, has never married, and has no children. He works as a project manager for a defense contractor where he began working in 2016. That contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. Applicant holds a master\u2019s degree and he is pursuing a second master\u2019s degree. He has held a security clearance since 2016. (Tr. 16-17, 27-28; GE 1, 4) The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana in about September 2018, while holding a security clearance. The SOR also alleged that he used marijuana in about November 2013 before he was granted a security clearance. The allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) admissions, his admissions to a defense investigator during his background investigation, and his admission in his SOR answer. (GE 1-3; SOR answer) Applicant described his 2013 marijuana use as occurring while he was in college. He was 25 years old at the time. He attended a football tailgate party and a pipe containing marijuana was being circulated at the party. Applicant smoked from the pipe on two occasions. He claims this was his first time he ever used marijuana and did so out of curiosity. H",

The DCSA CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 17, 2021, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 18, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 21, 2022, and the hearing \nwas scheduled for April 12, 2022. On March 24, 2022, DOHA issued an amended \nnotice of hearing and the hearing was held as rescheduled on April 11, 2022. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1-4, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I and its \ndiscovery letter was marked as HE II. Applicant testified and did not offer any exhibits at \nthe hearing. I kept the record open and post-hearing, Applicant submitted exhibit (AE) \nA, which was admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on April 19, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted both of the Guideline H \nallegations, with explanations. I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He is single, has never married, and has no children. \nHe works as a project manager for a defense contractor where he began working in \n2016. That contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 \net seq. Applicant holds a master\u2019s degree and he is pursuing a second master\u2019s degree. \nHe has held a security clearance since 2016. (Tr. 16-17, 27-28; GE 1, 4) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana in about September 2018, while \nholding a security clearance. The SOR also alleged that he used marijuana in about \nNovember 2013 before he was granted a security clearance. The allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) admissions, his \nadmissions to a defense investigator during his background investigation, and his \nadmission in his SOR answer. (GE 1-3; SOR answer) \nApplicant described his 2013 marijuana use as occurring while he was in college. \nHe was 25 years old at the time. He attended a football tailgate party and a pipe \ncontaining marijuana was being circulated at the party. Applicant smoked from the pipe \non two occasions. He claims this was his first time he ever used marijuana and did so \nout of curiosity. He felt euphoric after using it. He did not hold a security clearance at the \ntime. (Tr. 23; GE 2, 3) \nIn July 2016, in connection with his employment with a defense contractor, \nApplicant completed an SCA. When asked about previous drug use in Section 23 of the \nSCA, he admitted his 2013 marijuana use and stated the following: \u201cI tried the \nsubstance once in life and do not plan on using the substance again due to illegal \nnature of the substance and lack of enjoyment.\u201d Thereafter, Applicant was granted a \nsecurity clearance, in 2016.

In order for that to happen, he \nneeded to complete a new SCA, which he did in June 2020. On that SCA, he disclosed \nhis September 2018 marijuana use. It was at about this same time, two years after the \nfact, that Applicant first informed his employer about his marijuana use in 2018.

He believed that his friends were able to use marijuana legally because either \nthey held medical marijuana cards or use was legal under state law where they were \nlocated. One of the friends passed around a vape pen, which contained marijuana. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background investigation, he admitted to inhaling two to three puffs \nfrom the vape pen. During his hearing testimony, he claimed he only took one puff from \nthe vape pen containing marijuana. He knew immediately that doing so was a lapse in \ngood judgment. At the time of his use, he knew marijuana use was illegal and also \nagainst his employer\u2019s rules and drug policies. He held a security clearance at the time \nof this use. He did not report his use to his employer at the time. Applicant remains in \ncontact with this group of friends and he believes they still use marijuana. (Tr. 18, 27; \nGE 3, 4) \nApplicant explained that growing up he lived with his mother who had a \nsubstance-abuse addiction. That experience has made him sensitive to addictive \nqualities and why he is committed not to use illegal substances in the future. He plans to \ninform his friends that he will not use illegal substances in the future. (Tr. 19-20; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana in 2013 and in 2018. He held a security clearance \nwhen he used marijuana in 2018. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s marijuana uses were infrequent and somewhat remote in \ntime, his 2018 use occurred while holding a security clearance. Additionally, the 2018 \nuse was after he pledged not to use marijuana again when he disclosed his 2013 use in \nhis 2016 SCA. Applicant disclosed his 2018 use when he completed his 2020 SCA, but \nhe also waited two years to disclose this illegal marijuana use to his employer. A fair \nquestion to ask is, whether he would have ever disclosed the 2018 use, but for his \nemployer\u2019s decision to sponsor him for a top secret clearance, which necessitated him \ncompleting a new SCA. Applicant admitted that he was aware of his employer\u2019s drug-\nuse policy. Applicant provided a statement expressing that he had no future intent to \nuse marijuana. He remains in contact with the friends he used marijuana with in 2018. \nHe is committed to telling them he will not use any illegal substances in the future. \nGiven his 2018 marijuana use, after committing to not using marijuana again in his 2016 \nSCA, his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are called into question. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and AG 26(b) do not fully apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s five years of \nemployment, his mother\u2019s addictive history, and his written statement of his intentions \nnot to use marijuana in the future. However, I also considered that he used marijuana in \n2018 while holding a security clearance even though he previously expressed his \nintention to not use marijuana in his 2016 SCA. His recent marijuana use, while holding \na security clearance, demonstrates that he does not possess the reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment to hold a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 62 years old. He married his wife in 1986, and they have two adult sons. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1982 as a supply-chain analyst. He has held a DOD secret clearance since approximately 2004. (Item 3; Item 4) The record evidence shows that Applicant has significant outstanding financial obligations, to include: (1) approximately $43,729 in delinquent Federal income taxes for tax years 2008-2012, 2014-2015, and 2018-2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k.); (2) $3,247 in outstanding State A taxes for tax year 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.l.); and (3) various consumer and mortgage debts delinquent in the approximate amount of $16,534.

(Item 2) \nA copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated April 12, 2022, was provided \nto Applicant. Department Counsel attached as evidence to the FORM Items 1 through 6. \nApplicant received the FORM on April 28, 2022, and he was afforded a period of 30 days \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not \nrespond to the FORM. On August 4, 2022, the case was assigned to me. Without \nobjections, I admitted and considered all of the FORM\u2019s proffered evidence. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 62 years old. He married his wife in 1986, and they have two adult \nsons. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982. He has worked for a defense contractor \nsince 1982 as a supply-chain analyst. He has held a DOD secret clearance since \napproximately 2004. (Item 3; Item 4) \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant has significant outstanding financial \nobligations, to include: (1) approximately $43,729 in delinquent Federal income taxes for\ntax years 2008-2012, 2014-2015, and 2018-2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k.);\n(2) $3,247 in outstanding State A taxes for tax year 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.l.); and (3) various\nconsumer and mortgage debts delinquent in the approximate amount of $16,534. (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.m-1.p) The record evidence further demonstrates that, with the exception of tax\nyears 2011 and 2017, Applicant has failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns\nfor years 2008 through 2019.

He also claimed he had entered into a repayment plan with one of his \nconsumer creditors (SOR \u00b6 1.n), and that he had executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure \nfor his delinquent timeshare. (SOR \u00b6 1.p.) He did not provide any supporting \ndocumentation to corroborate his assertions regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, 1.n and 1.p. (Item \n2) \nIn his February 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed several delinquent accounts and \nhis unpaid Federal taxes for tax years 2008-2015. He claimed he was in a repayment \nplan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In his January 2021 response to \nInterrogatories, he provided Federal tax account transcripts for tax years 2008 through \n2019, except for tax years 2013 and 2016. Several of the transcripts showed that he had \nentered into multiple installment agreements with the IRS, but failed to adhere to the \npayment arrangements. (Item 3; Item 4) \nApplicant was placed on notice that he had 30 days after receipt of the FORM to \nsupply additional information to mitigate the Guideline F security concerns. His failure to \nsubmit any material would result in me making a determination based on documentation \nprovided solely by the Government. Applicant chose not to submit any documentation. \n(FORM cover letter; Government\u2019s FORM brief) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority\nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. He has \nfailed to provide supporting documentation to demonstrate his good-faith efforts to \nremedy his significant amount of outstanding taxes, as well as his other delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR. He failed to provide Federal transcripts for tax years 2013 \nand 2016 to verify that he had filed his Federal income tax returns, as claimed. There is \ninsufficient information to determine that he no longer owes delinquent Federal or state \ntaxes. He has a long pattern of filing Federal tax returns late, and entering into installment \nagreements with the IRS to pay his tax delinquencies. The documents in evidence show \nthat the IRS terminated several agreements because of his failure to pay as agreed. \nAccess to classified and protected information requires faithful adherence to the \nrules and regulations governing such activity. A person who fails to address concerns, \neven after having been placed on notice that his or her access or security clearance is in \njeopardy, may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are at stake. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy career as a Defense contractor and the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.

He was curious about the smell \nof cocaine, which he had never seen or smelled before. He understood from a \ndocumentary he had seen that cocaine smelled like kerosene. He was offered the \nopportunity to inhale some cocaine, but he declined. Out of curiosity, he tried to smell it \nand inadvertently inhaled a small amount. He felt no effect from this brief exposure to \ncocaine. He disclosed the exposure in his SCA. Applicant also disclosed in his SCA his \naccidental exposure to marijuana in August 2019.

He took a couple of puffs. \nHe later learned that the pen contained THC. (Answer at 2; SCA at 65-68.)  \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he used marijuana a few times in his \nsophomore and junior years in high school. He stopped using marijuana before his senior \nyear in high school. He was focused then on his academic work and his applications for \ncollege. He also changed the circle of friends with whom he spent time. He confirmed that \nhe has no intention to use illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. at 15-16, 24.) \nApplicant again denied the SOR allegation 1.b that he used cocaine in May 2019. \nHe testified that he has never used cocaine in his life. He explained that this incident \noccurred when he was attending a friend\u2019s graduation party at someone\u2019s house. He \nentered a bedroom to pick up his phone charger, which he had left in the room earlier in \nthe day. He found three individuals he did not know using cocaine in the room. The \ncocaine users offered Applicant the opportunity to inhale some of their cocaine, but he \ndeclined. He was curious, however, about the smell of cocaine because he had seen in \na documentary that cocaine was made using kerosene and had a heavy smell of \nkerosene. He testified: \nI inadvertently got an extremely small amount on me while inhaling to sniff to see \nif it smelled of kerosene. I never ingested any of it. I quickly got it off [me] and left \nthe room. \n(Tr. at 17.) He testified that a small amount of cocaine got on the tip of his nose and he \n\u201cinstantly got it off\u201d using his shirt sleeve. He insisted that no cocaine ever entered his \nnose or body. (Tr. at 15-30, 39.) \nApplicant also testified about the marijuana incident. He said that he mistakenly \nassumed that the vape pen he was offered in August 2019 was a \u201cnormal nicotine-\nflavored pen.\u201d He took two puffs. He learned later that the pen contained marijuana. \nBefore using the vape pen, he only sensed a fruity smell. He did not feel any effects of \nthe marijuana after using the pen. He does not smoke cigarettes, but he has tried vape \npens used by his friends. Applicant did not know the person who offered him the vape \npen. It was the first time he met her. Applicant was in Las Vegas to celebrate his friend\u2019s \nbirthday with a larger group and the woman with the vape pen was part of that group. \nNeither Applicant\u2019s friend nor his girlfriend use marijuana. He had no reason to suspect \nthat the vape pen contained illegal drugs. (Tr. at 15-20, 30-39.) \nApplicant formally self-reported both the cocaine and the marijuana incidents after \ntalking to his security officer. They had that discussion in May 2019 when Applicant was \npreparing the SCA to apply for a higher-level security clearance. He did not report the \nincidents earlier because he did not believe either one met the threshold requirements for \nself-reporting because both incidents were unintentional and he did not actually inhale \nany cocaine.

I found \nApplicant\u2019s testimony generally to be credible. I further found Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredibly supported his accounts regarding the two 2019 drug incidents as well as his \nstatement of his values. At the hearing, he impressed me as a young man with maturity \nand candor well beyond his years. (Tr. at 23.) \nMitigation \nApplicant\u2019s whole-person evidence describes him as a person of character. During \nhis college years, he volunteered to contribute his free time to a program called Great \nMinds in STEM. This program served middle school and high school students from lower \nincome neighborhoods. The volunteers taught engineering principles and encouraged the \nstudents\u2019 interests in engineering and careers in engineering. He is also actively involved \nin his church. He provided five character reference letters from friends and co-workers \nwho know him well. They all praise his intelligence, trustworthiness, honesty, and \noutstanding work ethic. One reference noted that he obtained scholarships and became \nthe first in his family to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. His work performance evaluations in the \nrecord also describe Applicant as a person who is passionate about his work and who \nhas high ethical standards. (AE J; AE K; AE O; AE Q; AE R.) \nApplicant also submitted a signed statement of his intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. His statement also contains an acknowledgment that \nany violation of his pledge not to use illegal drugs in the future would be grounds for the \nrevocation of national security eligibility. (AE D.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1, Guideline H \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription and \nnon-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or \nmental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 could apply to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted past involvement with illegal drugs establishes at least AG \u00b6 \n25(a). AG \u00b6 26 sets forth four mitigating conditions under Guideline H. The following two \nmitigating conditions have possible application to the facts in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance\nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; and \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) has been established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana in high school \nhappened long ago and is unlikely to recur. His unintentional exposure to cocaine and \nmarijuana after he had been granted a DoD security clearance occurred under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely that he would ever put himself in a position again \nwhere he might accidentally be exposed to illegal drugs. Both of the more recent incidents \nwere the result of questionable judgments, as Applicant has readily admitted, but this \nbehavior happened more than two years ago. Applicant expressed sincere regret for his \nactions and has learned from these experiences. His career as an engineer, which \nrequires holding a security clearance, is very important to him. He has provided \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nconvincing testimony that these past incidents will not be repeated. Significantly, he \nenhanced his credibility by reporting his recent experiences with illegal drugs to his \nsecurity officer and formally submitting his disclosure in writing. Applicant\u2019s behavior does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant has also established mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b). He has been \ncompletely transparent about the two incidents of unintended exposure to illegal drugs in \n2019. He has provided credible testimony that he will never put himself in the position \nagain in which he unintentionally or intentionally exposes himself to illegal drugs. He no \nlonger associates with his drug-using friends from high school. No similar instances have \noccurred in over two years. He has also provided a signed statement of his intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his past drug \ninvolvement. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each allegation (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g) each with brief comments. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old. He graduated from high school in 2003 and from college in 2007. He earned a Ph.D. in 2014. He then spent two years as a post-doctoral researcher. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since May 2016. He previously worked for the same company in 2007 and 2008. He and his wife have been married since 2015; they have no children. (Item 2) On his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had delinquent student loans, both federal and private. (Item 2 at 34-37). Applicant discussed these and other debts in his January 2019 background interview. (Item 3) In December 2020, he responded to interrogatories from DOHA about his finances. He provided a personal financial statement, an October 2020 paystub, and a May 2020 agreement with the U.S. Department of Education to rehabilitate his delinquent federal student loans (with a balance of about $43,000) by paying $1,025 per month.

Applicant \nreceived the FORM on December 6, 2021. He was afforded 30 days to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the \nFORM, and on March 31, 2022, the case was forwarded to the DOHA hearing office for \nassignment to an administrative judge for a decision on the written record. The case was \nassigned to me on May 4, 2022. The SOR and the answer (combined as Item 1) are the \npleadings in the case. Items 2 through 9 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nThe document Applicant attached to his answer is marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A \nand admitted without objection.  \nFindings of Fact \n In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each allegation (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.g) each with brief comments. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He graduated from high school in 2003 and from college \nin 2007. He earned a Ph.D. in 2014. He then spent two years as a post-doctoral \nresearcher. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since May \n2016. He previously worked for the same company in 2007 and 2008. He and his wife \nhave been married since 2015; they have no children. (Item 2) \nOn his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had delinquent student loans, both federal \nand private. (Item 2 at 34-37). Applicant discussed these and other debts in his January \n2019 background interview. (Item 3) In December 2020, he responded to interrogatories \nfrom DOHA about his finances. He provided a personal financial statement, an October \n2020 paystub, and a May 2020 agreement with the U.S. Department of Education to \nrehabilitate his delinquent federal student loans (with a balance of about $43,000) by \npaying $1,025 per month. (Item 4) \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by the credit reports \nin the record, from September 2017, July 2019, April 2020, February 2021, and November \n2021. (Items 5-9) The SOR debts total $36,477 in federal student loans, $14,470 in debts \nto a bank, and a $936 tax lien. They are detailed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($16,927), 1.b ($10,589), 1.d ($5,922), and 1.f ($3,039) are all federal \nstudent loans to the U.S. Department of Education. With his answer to the SOR, Applicant \nprovided a copy of the same rehabilitation agreement he submitted with his Interrogatory \nResponse. According to that agreement, signed in May 2020, Applicant had four \ndelinquent federal student loans, on which he owed about $43,000. He was to pay $1,025 \nper month.

As a result, he began receiving payment notices. For a time, he was on a \nrepayment plan, but stopped making payments after he consulted legal counsel. Instead, \nhe fell behind. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans are likely in forbearance under the Coronavirus \nAir, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020. President Biden recently \nextended this forbearance period through August 2022. It allows for a suspension of loan \npayments, a zero percent interest rate, and collections on student loans are halted. (See \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19). He provided no documentation \nof any payments made on his federal student loans, either before he entered into the \nrehabilitation plan, or since, and he does not set forth a plan to address his federal student \nloans when the CARES Act forbearance period ends. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($8,736) and 1.e ($5,734) are debts to a bank. Applicant indicated in \nhis background interview that he believes the accounts are private student loans that he \nmay have co-signed for his wife, but he was unsure of any details. (Item 3 at 5) His credit \nreports list the accounts as being deferred, in collection, and most recently, charged off. \n(Items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) In his Answer, Applicant admitted the debts and suggested, without \ncorroborating evidence, that they were under the same rehabilitation agreement as the \nfederal student loans. These debts are unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($956) is an unresolved state tax lien entered against Applicant in 2009. \n(Item 5 at 2) It is not listed on subsequent credit reports. The tax lien was issued by State \n1, where Applicant earned his Ph.D., between 2007 and 2014. (He now lives and works \nin another state, State 2). In his background interview, he indicates that he erroneously \nclaimed State 1 as his residence one year and was therefore assessed tax on his income. \n(Item 3 at 4) In his answer, he said that, while he admitted the debt, it is \u201cin adjudication\u201d \nand that his \u201cincome\u201d was actually an educational stipend. (Item 1) He provides no \ndocumentation to support either the fact of the dispute or the validity of his assertion. \nHowever, the tax lien appears to be an isolated circumstance. \nWith his interrogatory response, Applicant provided an October 2020 pay stub from \nhis employer. At that time, he earned $56.39 per hour and worked full time. With a 40-\nhour work week, he would earn $2,255.60 per week, and $117,291.20 per year (52 \nweeks). (Item 5) It is presumed that he earns a similar income now, a year and a half\nlater, working for the same employer, his clearance sponsor, though this is not \ndocumented.  \n \nWith his answer, Applicant provided no documentation about any efforts to pay or \nresolve any of his debts, either through the debt relief program or otherwise. He provided \nno updated information about his current financial stability. He also did not respond to the \nFORM, so the only information about his financial situation is taken from prior information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \nApplicant has significant past-due federal student loan debts, private debts, and \nan unresolved state tax lien. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nMost of Applicant\u2019s debts are federal student loans. They are likely in forbearance \nunder the CARES Act. However, the record shows that they became delinquent long \nbefore the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Applicant entered into a rehabilitation \nplan in May 2020, but provided no documentation of any efforts to address his federal \nstudent loans either before then or afterwards, nor has he set forth a plan or intention to \ndo so. He asserts, incorrectly and without support, that his two delinquent private loans \n(which may be student loans or something else) are covered by the rehabilitation plan. \nThose debts remain charged-off and unresolved. Even Applicant\u2019s 2009 tax lien, likely an \nexplainable and isolated circumstance, is unresolved, and he provided no updated \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumentation to address its status. Applicant has a Ph.D. and seems to make a good \nliving. It appears he has the means to address his student loans and other debts in a \nresponsible way. But he did not provide documentary evidence of payments towards his \ndebts, or efforts to resolve them. Accordingly, he did not provide sufficient evidence that \nany mitigating conditions should apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concern shown by his history of delinquent debts. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient information \nto mitigate the security concerns about his finances under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Applicant applied for and successfully obtained security clearances during his time in the military. (Item 3) Applicant is an employee of defense contractor X for whom he has worked since March 2017. Applicant worked for defense contractor Y from January 2010 until November 2016. From January 2016 until March 2017, Applicant owned and operated a restaurant. His ownership and work at his restaurant overlapped with his work at defense contractor Y from January 2016 until November 2016. In February 2016, defense contractor Y issued a written reprimand to Applicant for violating its timekeeping policy by failing to report for work as required from January 5, 2016 until February 2, 2016. In March 2016, as Applicant continued to violate its timekeeping policy, defense contractor Y issued a final written reprimand to Applicant.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008. Applicant applied for and \nsuccessfully obtained security clearances during his time in the military. (Item 3) \nApplicant is an employee of defense contractor X for whom he has worked since \nMarch 2017. Applicant worked for defense contractor Y from January 2010 until \nNovember 2016. From January 2016 until March 2017, Applicant owned and operated a \nrestaurant. His ownership and work at his restaurant overlapped with his work at \ndefense contractor Y from January 2016 until November 2016. In February 2016, \ndefense contractor Y issued a written reprimand to Applicant for violating its \ntimekeeping policy by failing to report for work as required from January 5, 2016 until \nFebruary 2, 2016. In March 2016, as Applicant continued to violate its timekeeping \npolicy, defense contractor Y issued a final written reprimand to Applicant. (Items 3, 6-9) \nIn October 2016, defense contractor Y undertook an investigation into Applicant\u2019s \ntimekeeping. After comparing Applicant\u2019s badge readings with his timecards, it found \nthat Applicant had overcharged 500.5 hours, costing it $88,673. Applicant admitted to \novercharging his time. He stated that he had \u201clost focus\u201d on his work with defense \ncontractor Y because of an outside business activity. On at least one occasion, \nApplicant\u2019s manager at defense contractor Y found Applicant at his restaurant when he \nwas supposed to be working for defense contractor Y. As a result of these findings, \ndefense contractor Y terminated Applicant\u2019s employment. (Items 3, 6-9) \nThe SOR alleges this termination and Applicant\u2019s overcharging of his hours \nworked. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his \nemployment, but denied that he had overcharged his time. Despite admitting to his \nemployer that he overcharged it, he averred in his response to the SOR that it was \u201chis \nunderstanding\u201d that he complied with all of his employer\u2019s timekeeping requirements \nbecause he was on a flex work schedule. (Items 1, 2) \nThe SOR also alleges Applicant\u2019s 2017 Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing and 2018 \ndismissal, and his six delinquent debts totaling about $380,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.g). The \ndebts include, among other things, an unpaid commercial lease, an unpaid small \nbusiness loan, unpaid credit cards, and an unpaid state tax lien. In his response to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted the SOR debts with the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.g, \nwhich he denied. Each of the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6 2 are established through a \ncredit report, the Government\u2019s exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s admissions. (Items 1-5) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a failed business venture, whose \ndebts he personally guaranteed, and his unsuccessful attempts to salvage the business \nby incurring additional individual debt. In 2017, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nto resolve his indebtedness by negotiating lower payments. He then attempted to \ndischarge his debts without payments by converting his bankruptcy to a Chapter 7. \nHowever, facing his trustee\u2019s claim of abuse, he converted the bankruptcy back to a \nChapter 13. In 2018, the court dismissed Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy for his failure to confirm \na Chapter 13 plan. After his bankruptcy was dismissed, Applicant claimed to have \nenlisted the assistance of his former bankruptcy attorney to help him resolve his \ndelinquent debts.

He did not provide evidence of why it was cancelled. \nHe did not address the tax consequences, if any, of this cancellation. (Items 1, 2, 4, 5) \nThe $4,894 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e has not been resolved.

In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted this debt and claimed that his \nattorney advised him to prioritize paying the state tax debt listed in SOR \u00b6 2.g. over this \ndebt. He claimed that he will discuss a plan to resolve the debt with this attorney. (Items \n1, 2, 3, 4) \nThe $16,197 state tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g has been resolved. Applicant \nprovided corroborating documentation to show this lien had been paid. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant stated that he intends to pay some of the debts in the SOR. He did not \nrespond to the FORM, so more recent information about his finances is not available. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. This includes, but is not limited to, \nconsideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources. \n \nApplicant consistently and repeatedly committed time-card fraud with his former \nemployer. He charged approximately 500 hours to his former employer for time he \nspent working at his own restaurant. He continued engaging in this egregious breach of \ntrust despite being warned to stop. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nhange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \nircumstances or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \nnappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nc\nc\ni\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nDespite the significant evidence of Applicant\u2019s time-card fraud and his admission \nof it to his employer, Applicant takes the position that he did nothing wrong. There is \ninsufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s misleading and untrustworthy behavior is \ninfrequent or an outlier. His consistent and repeated fraudulent behavior with no \nadmission of culpability leaves me with questions about his reliability and good \njudgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including an unpaid commercial \nlease, unpaid credit card debts, an unpaid small business loan, and delinquent state \ntaxes. He also filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was dismissed for failure to comply \nwith the rules of the bankruptcy court. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his failed restaurant business that \nhe opened in January 2016 and closed in March 2017. \nWhile there is insufficient evidence to determine the cause of the failure of \nApplicant\u2019s restaurant business, I will give him the benefit of the doubt and consider it a \nbusiness downturn. Therefore, for purposes of mitigation, I find that the conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. \nApplicant provided documentary corroboration that the $16,196 state tax lien \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g was paid prior to the issuance of the SOR. SOR \u00b6 2.g is concluded \nfor Applicant. \nApplicant has received an IRS Form 1099-C for the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 2.d. \nHowever, he did not provide evidence of why the debt was cancelled. He also did not \naddress the tax consequences, if any, of this cancellation. Therefore, Applicant has \nfailed to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to this \ndebt. \nWhile Applicant claimed to have hired an attorney to help him resolve his \nfinancial issues, he has not provided evidence of what the attorney has done to help. \nTherefore, I cannot determine that the financial issues are being resolved. \nApplicant reasonably attempted to resolve his debts by filing a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in 2017. However, he then attempted to inappropriately have those debts \ndischarged without payments under a Chapter 7. Ultimately, when he was forced to \nrevert his bankruptcy back to a Chapter 13, he was unable to meet the bankruptcy \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncourt\u2019s requirements to continue his case and it was dismissed. Thus, I find Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy efforts to be of little mitigating value and emblematic of his inability to meet \nhis financial obligations. \nThere is no documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution of the \nother SOR debts listed in paragraph 2. Applicant stated that he intends to pay the \nremaining SOR debts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute \nfor a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case \nNo. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. His delinquent debts are \nsubstantial and dated, and he has not provided evidence of his plan to resolve them. I \nam unable to conclude that he acted responsibly under the circumstances, that he \nmade a good-faith effort to pay his debts, or that there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control. His financial issues are ongoing. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nFinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 63 years old. He was born in a foreign country and immigrated to the United States as a political refugee in 1981 at the age of 22. He became a U.S. citizen in June 1989. He married in 2002 and divorced in March 2016. He and his former wife have two children, ages 18 and 15. He graduated from high school in 1979 in the country of his birth. He has taken college classes in the United States and earned a certificate. In 2015 he applied for a security clearance, which was granted in May 2016 (or possibly in 2018, Tr. at 42), so that he could work for a U.S. Government contractor as a linguist in the country of his birth. He is seeking to retain his clearance in relation to his employment as a linguist with a different Government contractor. He has worked for that contractor since November 2019.

Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on April 27, 2022. The case was initially assigned to another judge and then \nwas reassigned to me on May 18, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) initially scheduled the hearing for June 28, 2022. Due to a scheduling conflict, I \nrescheduled the hearing for July 11, 2022. DOHA issued an Amended Notice of Video \nTeleconference Hearing on May 16, 2022. The case was heard as rescheduled. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. GE 1 was \nadmitted without objection. Applicant objected to the admission of GE 3-7, but I overruled \nhis objection and admitted the exhibits. Applicant objected to the admission of GE 2, and \nI sustained his objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented 11 \ndocuments, which I marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through K (AE K consists of \ndocuments provided by Applicant to the Government investigator and are attached to GE \n2) and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on July \n18, 2022. (Tr. at 17-38, 62.)  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 63 years old.

Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $10,202. Applicant opened this \ncredit-card account in 2012 and defaulted on the account in January 2016. The credit \ncard was used for business and personal expenses. Applicant has made no subsequent \npayments on this account. He believes that the statute of limitations has expired on this \ndebt. He testified that he contacted the creditor when he became employed by his current \nemployer in 2019, but he was unable to pay the amount demanded by the creditor. He \ndid not contact the creditor earlier when he first began working in as a linguist in June \n2018. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 48-54; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 7 at 3; \nAE A at 10-11.) \n1.b. Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $1,859. Applicant opened this \ncredit-card account in 2013 and defaulted on the account in March 2016. The account \nwas charged off. Applicant has made no payments on this account to resolve this debt. \nThis debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 52; GE 3 at 3-4; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 3; GE 7 at 4.) \n1.c. Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $2,448. Applicant opened this \ncredit card account in 2012 and defaulted on the account in February 2016. The account \nwas charged off. Applicant has made no subsequent payments on this account. This debt \nis not resolved. (Tr. at 52; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 3.) \n1.d. Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $4,998. Applicant defaulted on \nthis account, and the creditor placed it for collection. Applicant has made no further \npayments on this account. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 55-58; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 2.) \n1.e. Credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $3,790. Applicant defaulted on \nthis account, and the creditor placed it for collection. Applicant has made no payments to \nresolve this account. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 57-58; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 2-3.) \n1.f. Retail store credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $654. Applicant \nopened this credit card account in 2011 and defaulted on the account in February 2016. \nThe account was charged off. Applicant claimed that this debt was paid off through a \npayment to a collection agency. The names of the original creditors and the amounts of \nthe debt do not match to support his claim. See discussion in the Mitigation section below. \nAlthough Applicant believes he paid the collection agency for this debt, he has not \ndocumented that payment. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 58-66; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 5; \nGE 5 at 4.) \n1.g Loan account charged off in the amount of $6,342. Applicant opened this \naccount in 2012 for his business in the original amount of $21,000 and after repaying \nmuch of the loan, he defaulted on the account in February 2015. The account was \ncharged off, and the creditor placed it for collection.

(Tr. at 66; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 5; GE 5 at 4.) \n1.h Collection account on a credit-card debt charged off in the amount of $5,973. \nApplicant defaulted on this account, and the creditor placed it for collection. In his Answer \nApplicant wrote that he entered into a payment plan with the collection agency in 2019. \nIn support of that statement, he provided to a Government investigator a letter from the \ncollection agency, dated July 31, 2020, confirming Applicant\u2019s payment arrangement to \npay this debt with a balance of $5,973.16. Under the terms of his plan, he was obligated \nto pay $5.00 per month for 12 months beginning August 30, 2020. He provided no \ndocumentation evidencing his payments. The terms of the plan make no mention of any \nfuture payments beyond the $60 paid over the first year. Applicant claimed that he made \nadditional payments totaling about $2,800, but he provided no documentation to support \nthat claim and no evidence from the creditor that the debt had been resolved. In light of \nthe available record evidence, this debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 74-75; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at \n2; AE K at 2-3.)  \nMitigation \nIn 2001, Applicant started his own retail business and subsequently expanded the \nbusiness into wholesale and import/export. His business faced new regulations and \ntaxation in 2014 and his business ultimately failed in 2015 or 2016, causing the numerous \ndefaults on the credit cards and a loan discussed above. His marriage also failed that \nyear and he filed for divorce. His children were eight and 11 years old at that time, and \ntheir mother declined to have custody of the children, leaving them with Applicant. He \nwas 56 years old at that time, and he felt he had limited job opportunities. He experienced \na period of underemployment or unemployment before beginning work in July 2018 as a \nlinguist. (Tr. at 12-16.) \nApplicant discussed his credit problems with a non-profit organization. He was \ncounseled to consolidate all of his debts and pay a monthly payment or to file for \nbankruptcy. He had insufficient income to pay a consolidation loan, and he did not want \nto file for bankruptcy. He explained his situation with his creditors and none of them \npursued legal actions. Two creditors transferred their debts to collection agencies. \nApplicant has worked with the collection agencies, as discussed above and below. (Tr. at \n14-15, 16, 73-74.) \nApplicant was hired as a linguist by a U.S. Government contractor in late 2014. He \ndisclosed his financial problems in his first security clearance application in 2015. In July \n2018 he was deployed to a war zone. His ex-wife took custody of their children and \nApplicant paid her child support. He worked for that employer until October 2019. In \nNovember 2019 he began working for a new employer as a linguist supporting a different \nU.S. agency.

He wrote \nthat the cause of the delinquencies was a \u201cbad economy.\u201d In his 2019 e-E-QIP he \nprovided some additional information about his delinquent debts. In another exhibit and \nat the hearing, Applicant argued that he was granted a clearance in 2016 or 2018 after \nfully disclosing his history of delinquent debts in his 2015 e-QIP and during his \nbackground interviews. (Tr. at 15, 42; GE 1 at 39-43; AE D at 109-110; AE I at 2.) \nApplicant submitted two reference letters. One is from Applicant\u2019s supervisor who \nstrongly supports Applicant in his effort to establish mitigation of the security concerns \nraised by his financial delinquencies. He describes Applicant as \u201cthorough, conscientious, \nand kind\u201d The reference provider\u2019s command handles sensitive matters in a U.S. \nembassy in a foreign country. He values Applicant\u2019s discretion and dedication. The \nsecond reference is from a U.S. military officer who has worked with Applicant for several \nmonths. He praised Applicant\u2019s skills as a linguist. \nApplicant also provided a Certificate of Appreciation he received in 2020 from the \nmilitary command he supported as a linguist. The Certificate refers to Applicant\u2019s \nperformance as a linguist as \u201cexceptional.\u201d \nAt the time of Applicant\u2019s background interview in 2020, he provided a document, \ndated July 30, 2020, evidencing a payment plan with a creditor that is not listed in the \nSOR. The amount of the delinquent debt is stated to be $813, and the agreement provides \nfor a single payment of $244. This debt is only listed in the Government\u2019s credit reports \ndated July 6, 2020 and November 3, 2020 (GE 5 and GE 4, respectively), which reflect a \ndefault, charge off, and referral to collection. The account was last active in 2016. It is not \nclear why this debt was not listed in the SOR. Applicant sought to explain that this debt \nwas alleged in 1.f of the SOR. The names of the original creditor listed in the SOR and \nthe payment plan document do not match and therefore, do not support that argument. \nThe record evidence is incomplete regarding the history of this delinquency and payment \nplan. (Tr. at 60-64; GE 4 at 5; GE 5 at 3.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed approximately $30,000 for the \neight alleged delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and the credit \nreports in the record establish the existence of these debts and the application of the \nabove potentially disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nmitigate those security concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control; and \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe record shows that Applicant has not responsibly managed his substantial \ndebts resulting from his business failure and subsequent unemployment. None of the \ndebts alleged in the SOR have been resolved. His financial problems began with his \nbusiness failure in 2015 or 2016, and his divorce in 2016. He also had a period of \nunderemployment or unemployment in the following year or two. However, his lack of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naction to resolve the SOR debts since then does not show responsible conduct on his \npart. He began earning an income in 2018 as a linguist and has been working oversees \nfor most of the past four years without taking responsibility for his debts. None of the \nmitigating conditions wholly apply to the facts of this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nFinancial Considerations concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have given significant weight to Applicant\u2019s service \nto the U.S. Government as a linguist, and the sacrifices and dangers that his work \nrequires. His evidence in mitigation, however, does not outweigh the security-significant \nfailure by Applicant to address and resolve his debts from a number of years ago. He let \nhis debts become unenforceable due to their age without making payment arrangements \nto resolve them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

On April 4, 2022, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing \nfor April 19, 2022. The hearing proceeded as scheduled using the DOD Microsoft Teams \nvideo teleconference system. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4. \nApplicant testified, and her counsel offered 21 documents labeled Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA through U. I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence without objection. I held the \nrecord open for two weeks after the hearing in the event either party wanted to \nsupplement the record with additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted two \nadditional documents, AE V and AE W, which I admitted into evidence without objection. \nOn April 26, 2022, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.). \nFindings of Fact \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of \na DOD contractor who has worked for this employer since December 2020. Her job title \nis procurement manager. She married her husband in 1985 and they have two adult \nchildren. This is her first application for a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 24-29, 55; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009. She \nstated that she and her spouse experienced financial difficulties after her family\u2019s \nbusiness closed in 2005 due to a recession in the economy. In addition, her husband lost \nhis job in 2005 and started his own business that same year, which did not create \nsufficient revenue for the next three years. All of these factors prompted them to file for \nbankruptcy protection. They participated in the mandatory financial counseling course. \nShe and her spouse made systematic payments to the trustee for five years, and their \ncase was discharged in May 2013. (Tr. 23, 25-29; GE 1; AE B) \nApplicant stated that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was a duplicate of the \ndelinquent debt alleged in \u00b6 1.d. During the hearing, Department Counsel stipulated that \nthese accounts were duplicates. This delinquent account had been referred to LVNV for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $28,857. In about 2020, Applicant hired a credit \ncounseling law service to resolve this debt, but after a lengthy period of inaction, she \ncontacted another attorney. This attorney, who also represented her during her security \nclearance hearing, had her open an escrow account of $32,000 so he could negotiate a \nsettlement with the creditor. He provided all of the settlement negotiation emails and \nstated that he anticipated this account would be fully settled within the next 60 days. Ten \ndays following the hearing, Applicant provided documentation of a full settlement of this \naccount in the amount of $14,000. This account is resolved.

In 2018, Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter moved to another city and needed her mother to co-sign the apartment\u2019s two-\nyear lease agreement. Applicant co-signed the lease agreement, but her daughter \neventually needed to move out of the apartment before completion of the two-year period. \nHer daughter tried to work with the leasing manager, but her attempts to resolve this \nsituation were unsuccessful. Applicant also tried for over a year to work with the leasing \nmanager, who would not return her phone calls or emails. She turned this account over \nto her attorney, who successfully negotiated a settlement on this account for $3,485.04. \nReceipt of the settlement was provided, and this debt is fully resolved. (Tr. 31-32; AE M, \nAE N, AE O) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant is indebted to a lender in the approximate amount \nof $21,611. Applicant stated that she had no knowledge of this creditor, and when her \nattorney investigated the account, they discovered that her daughter had taken out a loan \nand forged her signature as a co-signor without her knowledge or consent. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel stated that the creditor is apparently aware of the forgery, because they filed a \nlawsuit against the daughter only, and Applicant was not listed as a co-defendant in the \ncomplaint. Documentation of the complaint was submitted. Although Applicant did not co-\nsign the loan for her daughter and is not legally responsible for this debt, it was her \nintention to assist her daughter in the resolution of the account with anticipated escrow \nmoney available after settlement of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. 33-34) \nApplicant\u2019s husband and their son are co-owners of a business. When the \nbusiness first opened, it was not producing much profit, but they made enough money to \npay the company\u2019s monthly expenses. Over time, the business grew and became \nestablished in the community. Last year the company had over one million in sales. \nApplicant submitted her monthly budget into the record. The personal monthly budget \nshowed monthly income of $13,500.00 and monthly expenses of $8,081.06. Applicant \nand her husband are financially secure and have not developed any new debts. They \nhave timely filed all income tax returns and do not owe any delinquent tax debt. (26-27, \n34; AE W) \nCharacter Reference \nApplicant submitted a character reference letter from her current boss, the director \nof global procurement. He lauded Applicant\u2019s high moral standards and her outstanding \nwork ethic for the mission she supports. He has worked with her since 2006, and places \na great deal of trust in her abilities. He readily endorsed Applicant for DOD security \nclearance eligibility. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The SOR alleges delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $62,000, and a previous Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 2009. The record \nestablishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties after her family-owned business closed \nin 2005, followed by her husband\u2019s loss of employment that same year. Although he did \nstart up his own company, the business did not provide adequate revenue for the first few \nyears of operation. These are circumstances that were beyond her control. In 2009, she \nand her spouse filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy and made regular payments to the trustee \nfor five years. Their case was fully discharged by the bankruptcy court in 2013. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMore recently, Applicant acted responsibly in dealing with her creditors by \ncontacting a law firm specializing in the settlement of delinquent consumer debt. \nUnfortunately, the law firm delayed taking action, and she turned to another attorney for \nlegal assistance. This attorney, who was also her counsel during the security clearance \nhearing, initiated an investigation into each delinquent account. He discovered that there \nwere duplicate accounts, and also learned that Applicant\u2019s adult daughter had forged \nApplicant\u2019s signature as a co-signor for a loan taken out without her mother\u2019s knowledge \nor consent. Two of the four debts alleged in the SOR were invalid debts attributed to \nApplicant. \nOf the two remaining debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant provided documentation \nthat both accounts are resolved. Currently Applicant and her spouse earn sufficient \nincome to pay all of their monthly expenses. They have not developed any new delinquent \ndebt. She participated in financial counseling and is current on filing and paying her \nFederal and state income taxes. She provided sufficient documentation to show her \nresponsible efforts in resolving her debts. Under the current circumstances, there are \nclear indications that her financial problems are fully resolved, and her finances are under \ncontrol. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis. \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his [her] off-duty conduct or \ncircumstances can have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the \napplicant's national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond her control, \nand she took responsible action in addressing them. Her supervisor praised her strong \nwork ethic and he finds her to be trustworthy. She is committed to keeping her financial \naffairs in order, and I find that future financial problems are unlikely to recur. After \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(TR at page 57 line 18 to page 58 line \n1.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Five conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has five alcohol-related work incidents between 2013 and 2019. She \nhas also been diagnosed as suffering from a severe Alcohol Use Disorder. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                 \n \n                               \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nNone of these apply. Applicant, still consumes alcohol, despite being diagnosed \nwith a severe Alcohol Use Disorder. \nGuideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nforth at AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability,\nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and\nthat may indicate an emotional, mental or personality condition, including,\nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid,\nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre\nbehaviors;                                                                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and                                                                                        \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including but not limited to failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions.           \nAppellant is suffering from Alcohol Use Disorder; i.e., her alcoholism is affecting \nApplicant psychologically. Therefore, AG \u00b6 28 is established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controlled with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or program for a \ncondition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified metal health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, or acceptable to and approved by \nthe U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s previous condition is under \ncontrol or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or \nexacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the\nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows\nindications of emotional instability; and \n \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nNone of these apply. Despite her \u201csevere\u201d Alcohol Use Disorder diagnosis, \nApplicant still consumes alcohol. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and H in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Alcohol \nConsumption and Psychological Conditions security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",
