Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On July 27, 2006,\nDOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant under Guideline F.  That finding is not at issue on appeal.\n1\n2\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 28,\n2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndetermination under Guidelines J and E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination should be reversed\nbecause her prior criminal conduct and falsifications have no bearing upon her current\ntrustworthiness and ability to do her job.  She also argues that the Judge gave insufficient weight\nunder the whole-person factors to the favorable evidence in the record, particularly her 10 years of\noutstanding job performance and the fact that she has acknowledged her prior mistakes.  Applicant\u2019s\narguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under\nany of its Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility.  Cf., ISCR Case No. 02-28935\nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually\nmishandles or fails to properly handle sensitive information before it can deny or revoke access to\nsuch information.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2007).  Trustworthiness\ndeterminations are not limited to consideration of an applicant's job performance or conduct during\nduty hours, and off-duty conduct can be relevant in assessing an applicant's trustworthiness\neligibility. ADP Case No. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).  An applicant with good or\nexemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative trustworthiness implications.\nSee, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2007).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth\na variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of trustworthiness concern\nto the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine an applicant's trustworthiness\neligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace. Id.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\n\n3\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nrecord evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007). \nGiven the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness\ndetermination under Guidelines J and E is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe determination of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems\nin ADP I/II/II sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Dillon L. Ross IV, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on January 7, \n2003.  On January 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) \nand B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 23, 2007; answered it on \nJanuary 31, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on February 5, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on December 31, 2007, and the case was assigned to me on January 2, 2008. \nScheduling of the hearing was delayed at the request of Applicant\u2019s counsel based on \nthe counsel\u2019s overseas Navy Reserve duty and the availability of a key witness for \nJune 9, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 29, 2008, scheduling the \nhearing for April 2, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf, presented the testimony of 11 witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A through I, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on April 17, 2008. The record closed on April 28, 2008. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI directed Department Counsel and Applicant\u2019s counsel to provide information \nconcerning the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, the Provisional Irish Republican \nArmy (PIRA), Sinn Fein, and the Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID, also known as \nINAC), all of which were referred to in evidence submitted by both sides. I set a \ndeadline of April 16, 2008. Both sides requested additional time, and I extended the \ndeadline until April 28, 2008. The requests for extension and my rulings are attached to \nthe record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.  \n \nDepartment Counsel responded to my order with a request for administrative \nnotice, which is attached to the record as HX II. Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted seven \nState Department documents, marked as Exhibits A-1 through A-7, which I have \nattached to the record as the basis for administrative notice. Applicant\u2019s counsel also \nsubmitted Exhibits A-8 through A-13, which I did not consider appropriate for \nadministrative notice, but they have been admitted without objection as AX J through O. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in the SOR. He \nadmitted some of the factual allegations in the SOR at the hearing. His admissions at \nthe hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old information technology systems administrator for a \nfederal contractor. He graduated from college in 1995. He has worked for his current \nemployer since April 2000.  \n \nIt is unclear from the record whether Applicant is applying for an initial clearance \nor continued eligibility for access to classified information. In a letter postmarked June \n20, 2002, he told the recipient he was moving to a new job that would require a \nclearance (GX 4 at 1). At the hearing, he testified he applied for a \u201csecret local \nclearance\u201d in late 2002 (Tr. 28). His counsel stated he held a clearance for \u201cseveral \nyears\u201d and the reinvestigation was triggered by an application for a higher level of \nclearance (Tr. 5). In January 2003, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question on his \nsecurity clearance application asking if the government had ever investigated his \nbackground and/or granted him a clearance (GX 1 at 9). I conclude he probably was \n\n \n3 \n \n \ngranted an interim clearance at some time after January 2003, but he has never \nreceived a final clearance. \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance assessments have rated him \u201cproficient\u201d in all \u201cshared \ncompetencies.\u201d His demonstrated strengths are in \u201crelationship building,\u201d \u201cteamwork,\u201d \nand \u201ccustomer focus,\u201d as reflected in his performance assessments for 2004 (AX C) and \n2005 (AX D). His supervisor for the past four or five years described him as \u201csolid\u201d and \nconsistent (Tr. 128). Another supervisor described his performance as \u201cgood\u201d and \ntestified he has no reason to question his integrity or ability to hold a clearance (Tr. 139-\n40). \n \n \nApplicant was married in June 1995 and divorced about two years ago. Two \nsons, ages six and nine, were born during the marriage (Tr. 27). His ex-wife, who has \ncustody of the children, testified on his behalf at the hearing and described him as a \ngood father (Tr. 117).  \n \n \nApplicant is politically active in his community and holds membership is several \nenvironmental and humanitarian organizations (Tr. 69-70). A party chairman in the state \nassembly who has known him for about five years described him as personable, \ndependable, a conscientious father, and a man of high character, integrity, and \nimpeccable honesty (AX I). \n \n \nAround 1998, Applicant became interested in Irish history. He joined the Ancient \nOrder of Hibernians (AOH) in 1999 because of his Irish ancestry and interest in Irish \nhistory. At the hearing, a local AOH official described the organization as a charitable \nIrish Catholic fraternal group (Tr. 147). He described AOH as a non-political \norganization whose mission is to promote Irish history and culture and perform \ncharitable works (Tr. 153). Another official described AOH as a fraternal Catholic \norganization based on friendship, unity, and Christian charity (Tr. 171). Its only political \ngoal is to see Ireland united peacefully (Tr. 171). To be eligible for membership, a \nperson must be a practicing Catholic of Irish descent.  \n \nEvery AOH chapter is required to have a \u201cFreedom for All Ireland\u201d chairman, \nresponsible for educating the membership on history and current events regarding \nefforts to achieve a united Ireland. The position was vacant in Applicant\u2019s chapter until \nhe volunteered to fill it (Tr. 33-34). An AOH officer who has known Applicant since \nFebruary 2001 described Applicant as one of the best officers they have ever had (Tr. \n167). He testified he regards Applicant as a person of outstanding character and an \noutstanding citizen (Tr. 168-69). \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts about Ireland. Ireland is a \nparliamentary republic. Nationalism is a potent force in Irish politics. The conflict in \nNorthern Ireland stems from a history of British rule, historical animosity between \nCatholics and Protestants, and various attempts to create a united Ireland. Nationalist \nand Republican groups seek an united Ireland, but Unionists and Loyalists want \nNorthern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. After decades of violence by both \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfactions, the British and Irish governments negotiated a ceasefire in 1994, followed by \nthe U.S.-brokered Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Ireland has remained largely free of \nterrorist incidents since 1998. U.S.-Irish relations have long been based on common \nancestral ties and shared values. Relations have broadened to economic and trade \npolicies as a result of Ireland\u2019s membership in the European Union and economic \nsuccess.  \n \nApplicant testified his father was involved in local politics for more than 30 years, \nand that learning Irish history \u201cpoliticized\u201d him (Tr. 34). In August 2000, he wrote a \nnewspaper article about British involvement in Ireland (AX G), identifying himself as an \nAOH member and \u201can Irish Republican activist.\u201d The article was entitled, \u201cAmericans \ncan help bring peace to Ireland.\u201d In the article, he commented favorably on the apparent \ninfluence of the U.S. on Great Britain to further the peace process in Ireland, but he \nexpressed displeasure about the lack of U.S. support for a united and independent \nIreland. He wrote:  \n \nIt is time for England to use a firm hand by refusing to pander to unionist \ndemands. American opinion matters to England. If the proper amount of \npressure is applied to her majesty\u2019s government, the crisis in the north of \nIreland would be over tomorrow. British troops could withdraw and United \nNations peacekeeping forces or perhaps a joint force of American. \nCanadian and Australian troops could help to keep the two sides from \nkilling one another as an uneasy peace matured into acceptance of a new \nstatus quo. \n \nUnfortunately, our government will not pressure England unless we \npressure our government first. It is important to remember how our country \ncame to be.  It is time to use our freedom to help end almost a millennium \nof mismanagement of one of our mother countries. Help Ireland. Help \nEngland help Ireland. It\u2019s time for us to do the right thing. \n \nHis article was met with displeasure by the president of the local AOH chapter, \nbecause he thought it inappropriate for AOH to appear \u201cpolitical.\u201d Applicant testified that \nwhen he wrote the article he considered himself a supporter of a free, united, Irish \nRepublic, but he was not a PIRA supporter (Tr. 100). When he answered the SOR, he \nstated he is no longer sure a united Ireland would be desirable because it could plunge \nNorthern Ireland back into war. \n \n \nIn carrying out his duties in AOH as the \u201cFreedom for All Ireland\u201d chairman, \nApplicant often searched the internet and email groups. He found an email group for the \nIrish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID), but it was closed to non-members. He was \ncurious about the \u201cnews he wasn\u2019t getting,\u201d checked the NORAID web site, found it \n\u201cvery benign,\u201d and joined NORAID sometime in 2000 to have access to the email list \n(Tr. 35-37). He did not attend any meetings but marched in one St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade \nas a NORAID member. Expecting NORAID to be more politically active than AOH, he \nbecame disenchanted with NORAID after about a year and did not renew his \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmembership. At the hearing, he testified he removed his name from the NORAID email \nlist \u201cyears and years ago.\u201d (Tr. 83.) However, he told a security investigator in \nNovember 2006 that he was still on the NORAID email list (GX 2 at 3). \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts about the Irish Northern \nAid Committee (NORAID, also known as INAC). In 1982, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit held that INAC was required to register as an \u201cagent of a foreign \nprincipal\u201d under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, because of its extensive \nconnections with the PIRA. In August 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice listed INAC \nas a \u201cpro-PIRA American group.\u201d \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts about the Provisional Irish \nRepublican Army (PIRA). The PIRA was formed in 1969 as the clandestine armed wing \nof Sinn Fein. In Northern Ireland, it targeted senior British officials, British troops, police, \nand Loyalist paramilitary groups. In mainland Britain, it conducted bombing campaigns \nagainst train and subway stations and shopping areas. The PIRA has not been linked \nwith terrorist attacks in the U.S., but it has been involved with the acquisition and \ntransportation of weapons and bomb-making materials from the U.S. to Ireland. The \nPIRA decreased its terrorist activities after the Good Friday Accord in 1998, but it \nrefused to \u201cdecommission\u201d its bomb and weaponry until 2005, and it continued its \nconnections with global terrorist organizations, including the Revolutionary Armed \nForces of Columbia. \n \n \nApplicant learned from a NORAID email that a PIRA member was sentenced to \n56 months in prison for attempting to ship firearms from the U.S. to Ireland on behalf of \nthe PIRA between April and July 1999. During his trial, the prisoner admitted he was an \nintelligence officer for the PIRA (GX 3; GX 4). The email encouraged NORAID members \nto write letters to several PIRA members imprisoned throughout the U.S.  Applicant \ndecided to contact the prisoner, who was in a low security prison, because he was the \nprisoner nearest his home. At the time, the prisoner was about 28 years old (GX 8 at 2) \nand Applicant was about 31.  \n \nApplicant exchanged letters with the prisoner, at first biweekly and then declining \nto monthly. In the letters, they talked about their families, Irish and U.S. history, politics, \nand the prisoner\u2019s involvement in the PIRA. In a letter postmarked November 20, 2002, \nApplicant told the prisoner he had a new assignment working with the Navy that \nrequired a secret clearance. He told the prisoner: \u201cGuess what I am worried about? \nThat\u2019s right . . .\u2019So, you\u2019ve been visiting an IRA man in [prison]?\u2019\u201d (GX 4 at 1). Applicant \nand the prisoner concluded all their letters with the PIRA slogan (\u201cOur day will come.\u201d) \nwritten in Gaelic (Tr. 94-95; GX 8).  \n \nIn one letter, the prisoner described the process for obtaining permission from \nprison authorities to visit him (Tr. 45). Applicant obtained approval to visit the prisoner \nand visited him several times, driving about three hours each way, with each visit lasting \nabout three hours. He had his picture taken with the prisoner on one visit (Tr. 97). He \noccasionally brought the prisoner food (Tr. 97). He testified that his only motivation for \n\n \n6 \n \n \nvisiting the prisoner was his religious upbringing, which considers visiting the \nimprisoned as a work of mercy (Tr. 46). According to Applicant, the prisoner did not \nattempt to recruit him or ask him to pass on any messages (Tr. 69, 77). Applicant had \nno contact with the prisoner after January 2003. After completing his sentence, the \nprisoner was released and deported to Ireland, where he now resides. \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant received an email advertising a lecture by a Sinn Fein officer \nat a local Irish pub. He attended the lecture and paid a $20 fee.  In 2003, he received \nanother email advertising a lecture by the president of Sinn Fein, at the same Irish pub. \nHe attended this lecture and paid a $50 fee (GX 2 at 3). He testified he believed the \nfees went to the Sinn Fein treasury (Tr. 90).  \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts about Sinn Fein. It began \nas a political movement dedicated to removing British forces from Northern Ireland and \nunifying Ireland. It is a recognized political party in Ireland, but it has been barred from \nparticipating in Irish government at times because of its links to the PIRA. It currently is \nan active participant in Irish government.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend for more than 20 years, a college history professor, described \nhim as a good man, a good father, and a good friend (Tr. 108) He testified he regards \nApplicant as a competent, reliable member of the community (Tr. 109). About two years \nago, at his friend\u2019s invitation, Applicant presented a lecture on Irish history (Tr. 106, \n110). \n \n \nA friend of Applicant\u2019s parents, who has known Applicant since his birth, \ndescribed Applicant as very honest, candid, upright, hard-working, trustworthy, and a \nperson who loves his country (Tr. 160-62). Another family friend testified that Applicant \nsaw politics as an opportunity to make a difference in the community. He testified \nApplicant has great respect for democracy, our political system, and our government, \nand would never be involved in a subversive or violent organization (Tr. 179). \nApplicant\u2019s ex-father-in-law, who has held a clearance for most of his adult life, testified \nthat Applicant was a \u201cgood candidate\u201d for a clearance and a good upstanding citizen \n(Tr. 190). Another friend of the family testified Applicant was \u201cvery wholesome,\u201d \nextremely inquisitive, and a very deep thinker (Tr. 195). An uncle who has known \nApplicant all his life described him as a good man with \u201cdedicated allegiance\u201d to the \nU.S. (Tr. 201). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant maintained a relationship from 2000 to \u201cat least 2002\u201d \nwith a citizen of Ireland who was a member of the PIRA and incarcerated in a U.S. \nprison for involvement in an illegal weapons procurement operation on behalf of the \nPIRA (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges Applicant told the citizen of Ireland he was being \ninvestigated for a security clearance required by his job (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Finally, it alleges \nApplicant identified himself as an \u201cIrish Republican activist\u201d on at least one occasion in \nAugust 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline E is set out in AG & 15 as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccredible adverse \ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be \nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(d). A disqualifying condition also may be \nraised by \u201c(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in \nactivities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community \nstanding.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(e). Finally, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cassociation \nwith persons involved in criminal activity.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(g).  \nApplicant\u2019s identification of himself as an \u201cIrish Republican activist\u201d does not itself \nraise a security concern, because lobbying for a united Ireland is a legitimate political \nactivity. In his newspaper article, Applicant did not espouse violence. Instead, he \nespoused pressuring England to withdraw its troops and replace them with an \ninternational peacekeeping force. However, when his \u201cIrish Republican activist\u201d views \nled him to befriend a convicted PIRA gun-runner and to tell his PIRA friend he was \nmoving into a sensitive position with the Navy, the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(d) and (e) were raised. His friendship with a convicted felon also raised AG \u00b6 16(g). \nHe expressed his concern in his letter to the prisoner that their friendship might prevent \nhim from obtaining a clearance. His friendship with the prisoner made him and his family \nknown to the PIRA as a potential ally, thereby making him vulnerable to pressure, \nmanipulation, or exploitation by the PIRA. \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d), (e), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \n\n \n9 \n \n \nit is never shifted to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). The \nfirst prong (\u201coffense is so minor\u201d) is not limited to criminal offenses but pertains to any \npersonal conduct raising security concerns. Writing a letter to a prisoner as an act of \nChristian charity would fall under this prong, but an extended relationship, including \nseveral three-hour visits and a three-hour drive each way, goes beyond \u201cminor.\u201d \nDisclosing to a convicted terrorist that he was moving to a sensitive position with the \nNavy was not \u201cminor.\u201d  \n \n \nThe second prong (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) is established, because five and \na half years have elapsed since Applicant\u2019s last contact with the prisoner. The third \nprong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established, because Applicant exchanged multiple letters \nand made multiple visits to the prisoner. \n \n \nThe fourth prong (\u201cunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d) is \nestablished. The relationship with the prisoner began about eight years ago, when \nApplicant was passionate about the cause of Irish Republicans. He was presented with \na unique opportunity to meet a real PIRA soldier who was close to him in age, and he \napparently found the experience fascinating. The relationship ended in January 2003. \nApplicant now realizes how foolish he was. The testimony of his supervisors and friends \nestablishes that he has matured into a responsible adult. He is regarded as a \u201csolid\u201d \nemployee, a good father, and a good citizen. \n \n \nThe political landscape in Ireland has changed. Sinn Fein is actively participating \nin Irish government. The PIRA decreased its violent activities after the Good Friday \nAgreement in 1998 and \u201cdecommissioned\u201d its arsenal in 2005. Applicant is not likely to \nhave a similar relationship with a member of the PIRA or other terrorist group again. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his inappropriate behavior. \nHe did not take any positive steps to alleviate the causes of his behavior; however, the \nPIRA prisoner was deported and they have had no contact since January 2003. The \nPIRA disarmed in 2005. It is unlikely that Applicant will find himself in a similar position \nagain. This mitigating condition is partially applicable. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cassociation with persons involved \nin criminal activity has ceased.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(g). This mitigating condition is established. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that the personal conduct discussed above also raises security \nconcerns under this guideline. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as \nfollows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.   \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under Guideline B may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). A \ndisqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n7(b). Applicant\u2019s relationship with and connections to the prisoner, which included \ndisclosure of his transfer to a sensitive job with the Navy, created a heightened risk of \n\n \n11 \n \n \nexploitation and manipulation, and it placed Applicant in a potential conflict-of-interest \nsituation. \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cunauthorized association with a \nsuspected or known agent, associate, or employee of a foreign intelligence service.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 7(g). Applicant apparently did not know the prisoner was an intelligence officer for \nPIRA. He did know, however, that the prisoner was a member of PIRA, a foreign \nterrorist organization. Although the facts of this case do not squarely fit into AG \u00b6 7(g), a \nsecurity concern arising from his association with a member of a foreign terrorist \norganization is raised. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by showing \u201cthe nature \nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant\u2019s relationship with the prisoner ended more than five \nyears ago. The countries involved, Ireland and the United Kingdom, are friendly \ncountries who share the values of the U.S. The PIRA is a terrorist organization but it has \nnot conducted terrorist activities against the U.S., it has generally complied with the \nGood Friday Agreement of 1998, and it \u201cdecommissioned\u201d its arsenal in 2005. Under \nthe current political environment, it is unlikely Applicant will be required to choose \nbetween the interests of Ireland, Northern Ireland, or the PIRA and the interests of the \nU.S. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict of \ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign \nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant never felt any loyalty or obligation to PIRA. At one time, he probably felt some \nloyalty to the prisoner, but that relationship ended more than five years ago. He still is \npassionate about the peace process in Ireland, but he has approached it as an \nacademic, historical, and philosophical issue. Notwithstanding his intense interest in \nIrish history and culture, he has never visited Ireland, and he has no relationships with \ncitizens of Ireland or Northern Ireland now that his relationship with the PIRA prisoner \nhas ended.  \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant has strong family, political, and social connections \nin the U.S. He believes deeply in democracy and the U.S. form of government. He is \npolitically active and involved in his community. I am satisfied he would resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \n\n \n12 \n \n \nApplicant has had no contact with the prisoner since January 2003. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n8(c) is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant has a reputation for becoming passionately involved in everything he \nfinds interesting and worthwhile. While educating himself on his Irish heritage, he \nbecame outraged at what he perceived were the injustices inflicted on the Irish people. \nIn spite of his strong beliefs, he is committed to nonviolence. His membership in AOH is \na reflection of his interest in Irish history and culture. It was not asserted as a security \nconcern by Department Counsel, and no security concerns based on AOH membership \nare raised by the evidence. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s membership in NORAID was not alleged in the SOR. The evidence \nreflects that Applicant joined this organization to gain access to emailed information, \nafter reviewing the organization\u2019s benign website. He was unaware of NORAID\u2019s \nconnections to the PIRA. He became disillusioned after a year and did not renew his \nmembership. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with Sinn Fein also were not alleged in the SOR. Sinn Fein \nwas a political pariah for years because of its association with the PIRA. It is now \naccepted as a legitimate political party and is actively involved in Irish government. \nApplicant\u2019s only contacts with Sinn Fein were two lectures by Sinn Fein leaders. He \ncontributed a total of $70 to Sinn Fein by paying fees for the lectures. \n \n \nThe gravamen of the security concern is Applicant\u2019s relationship with the \nprisoner. Applicant is an idealist and is attracted to political causes. Both he and the \n\n \n13 \n \n \nprisoner were relatively young when they met. The evidence suggests Applicant was \nattracted by the prospect of actually meeting a veteran of the struggle in Ireland, and the \ninitial attraction blossomed into feelings of friendship, at least on Applicant\u2019s part. He \nrealized his bad judgment in becoming involved with a convicted terrorist when he \napplied for a clearance. He did not provide any sensitive information to the prisoner and \nthe prisoner apparently did not attempt to gain any information from him or use him in \nany way. Since June 2003, no PIRA agent has contacted Applicant or attempted to \nexploit or manipulate him. Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. I \nam satisfied his bad judgment is mitigated. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E and \nB, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on personal conduct and foreign \ninfluence. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

He then attended college, receiving an Associate of Arts degree in accounting and data processing at the of age 23. He obtained his first job in the aerospace industry in June 1978. Over the next 30 years, he worked in private and public sector positions as a programmer and program analyst. In 1996, his government employer fired him because of a drinking problem.

When drinking, he failed to file federal and state income taxes for a\nnumber of years in the 1990s. He also failed to pay other expenses. Although he has paid his overdue\nstate income taxes, he has not paid his overdue federal income taxes. He recently filed for Chapter\n13 bankruptcy protection and has just started this process. Because his federal income tax issues\nremain unresolved, Applicant has not mitigated the financial concerns under Guideline F. Eligibility\nis denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 24, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On February 1, 2007\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29,\n2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA\nrecommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a\nposition of trust should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On March 5, 2007, Applicant\nsubmitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on April 4, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on May 17,\n2007. At the hearing on June 4, 2007, Applicant waived his right to receive the notice of the hearing\n15 days prior to the hearing. I conducted the hearing as scheduled.  The Government submitted seven\n2\nexhibits (GX) which were marked and admitted into the record as GX 1-7, without objection.\nApplicant submitted six exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and admitted as App Ex A-F without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was held open until June 25, 2007, to\nallow Applicant to submit further documentation. On that date, Applicant requested additional time\nto obtain his documentation, indicating that he had encountered difficulties getting some of the\ninformation requested.

He\ndenies the remaining allegations under Guideline F. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein.\nIn addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant, a 52-year-old senior application system analyst for a Department of Defense\ncontractor, seeks a position of public trust. He started working for the contractor in June 2002.3\nUpon his high school graduation in 1973, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army. Three years\nlater, he received an honorable discharge. He then attended college, receiving an Associate of Arts\ndegree in accounting and data processing at the of age 23. He obtained his first job in the aerospace\nindustry in June 1978. Over the next 30 years, he worked in private and public sector positions as a\nprogrammer and program analyst. In 1996, his government employer fired him because of a drinking\nproblem. In 2001, his employer terminated his position in a reduction-in-force action. When he\naccepted his current position in 2002, he moved across the country. During his work career, he twice\nheld a top secret security clearance.4\nApplicant married his first wife in 1978. They separated 13 years later and subsequently\ndivorced. He married his second wife in the 1990s and they later divorced. He married his current\nwife in December 2001. He has two children, ages 27 and 23, and two stepchildren, ages 17 and 14.\nHis son and two stepchildren live with him. His son and stepson will leave for college or further\neducational training at the end of the summer.5\nApplicant is a recovering alcoholic. In 1988 or 1989, his alcohol consumption increased\nsignificantly. For the next 10 years, he drank to excess on a daily basis. His drinking caused him to\nlose his family, home, and job of 10 years. His good financial rating plummeted. Between 1996 and\nMarch 1999, family or friends referred him for alcohol treatment. After each treatment program, he\nresumed his drinking. In March 1999, he admitted himself to an alcohol treatment center. He stopped\ndrinking on March 7, 1999. He participated in outpatient treatment, and continues to attend alcoholic\nanonymous programs twice a week. In March 2007, he received a pin for 8 years of sobriety. He states\nthat his life has improved greatly since he stopped drinking.6\nDuring his period of heavy drinking, Applicant failed to pay his bills, He did not file his\nfederal income tax returns for the years 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 (allegations 1.i through 1.m\nin the SOR). His estimated tax liability is over $70,000, more than 50% of which is for fees, penalties\nand interest. He has not yet filed these tax returns, upon the advice of his tax attorney. He has not\ncontacted the IRS about payment of these taxes, although his tax attorney has spoken with the IRS.\nHe did attempt to secure money to pay the taxes through the equity in his house. The credit company\ndenied his request, based on his credit history. He has not otherwise taken any action to resolve his\n\nGX 2 (Applicant\u2019s attachments to government interrogatories) at 3-9; App Ex A (Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13\n7\nBankruptcy Petition); App Ex K (Denial of equity loan, dated March 16, 2007); App Ex L (Additional documents related\nto amnesty program); Tr. at 21-22, 29-31, 32-34, 68-69.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated March 5, 2007; App Ex M ( Form 1040 for the years 1999, 2000, 2002,\n8\n2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006); Tr. at 27-29, 32.\nApp Ex A, supra note 7; App Ex I (Payments to Trustee); Tr. at 25-29, 38-39.\n9\nApp Ex G (Budget); App Ex H (Earnings statements for May and June 2007).\n10\nApp Ex C (Letter, dated June 1, 2007); App Ex E (Letter, dated May 31, 2007); App Ex F (Letter, dated May\n11\n21, 2007); App Ex J (Performance evaluations for 2004, 2005, and 2006 and confidentiality agreement).\n4\ntax debts. During the 1990s, he also failed to file his state income taxes, which resulted in state tax\nliens against him. He participated in a state tax amnesty program, and paid his outstanding state taxes.\nThe state released the liens it had filed.7\nIn addition to his failure to file his tax returns, Applicant\u2019s credit reports indicate several\nunpaid debts. He denies the debt in allegations 1.c ($303 placed for collection in 2000), 1.d. ($2,747,\nwhich was reported to the collection agency in 1999), and 1.e ($330, which was reported to the\ncollection agency in 1999). He admitted owing a telephone bill of $180 from 1998, and two medical\nbills totaling $2,371 from 1999 (allegations 1.f through 1.h). He has not paid these debts. He has filed\nhis taxes with the IRS since 1999, and has provided proof of his filings for all years, except 2001. His\nrecent tax returns indicate that he owed additional taxes on his federal taxes. The record does not\ncontain any evidence which reflects that these taxes were paid.8\nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in 1996 to stop the foreclosure on his house.\nHe did not follow through with the actions required of him, and the court dismissed his bankruptcy\npetition. He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on May 14, 2007. He listed all the debts identified\nin the SOR, including his federal tax liability. His largest debt is his federal tax debt, which comprises\n95% of his bankruptcy debt. On the advice of his tax attorney, he waited to file for bankruptcy until\nhis tax liability aged sufficiently to allow him to include his tax debt in his bankruptcy filing. His first\nbankruptcy creditor\u2019s meeting was held on May 31, 2007. In May 2007, he made his first interim\nmonthly payment of $100 to the bankruptcy trustee and he made his second payment on June 22,\n2007. He will make these interim payments until his full monthly payment is determined.9\nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly income is approximately $5,726 and his net monthly income\naverages approximately $3,000. His wife works, providing an additional net monthly income of\n$1,355 for a total household net income of approximately $4,355. His household expenses total\napproximately $4,350, leaving no additional income for the payment of debt.10\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for the last three years indicate that he consistently met\nhis employer\u2019s performance expectations and that his overall work performance steadily improved.\nHis supervisor describes him as a respected and valued member of his work team, and as trustworthy\nand honest. His pastor and a co-worker describe him as trustworthy, reliable, friendly and honest. On\nJune 15, 2007, Applicant signed a confidentiality agreement required by his employer. Should he\nreveal any information protected by privacy rights, he could be terminated immediately.11\n\nTr. at 75-82.\n12\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b62(a)(1)-(9).\n13\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n14\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., December 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\nDepartment of the Navy v.

She has not seen him\ndrink and she manages the household bills. His 23-year-old son also testified on his behalf. He\ndescribed his childhood memory of his father as always being drunk. Since his father stopped\ndrinking, they have developed a good relationship.12\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against a trustworthiness determination is not outcome determinative, the\nrevised AG should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In\naddition, each security clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these\nare: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.13\nThe sole purpose of a trustworthiness determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties to an applicant.  The\n14\ngovernment has the burden of proving controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify\nthe applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The burden of proof is\n15\nsomething less than a preponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the\n16\nburden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome\nthe case against him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n17\nfavorable clearance decision.  Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be\n18\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative\nguidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n19\nId.\n20\nId.; Directive, revised AG \u00b6 2(b).\n21\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n22\n Directive, revised AG \u00b6 2(b).\n23\n6\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n19\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n20\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n21\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n22\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. Any\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n23\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit reports reflect liens filed\nby the state government for unpaid taxes and unpaid debts, which applicant acknowledged. He also\nadmitted that he did not file his federal income taxes for five years in the 1990s. Although he paid his\nstate taxes, he has not paid his federal taxes or his old debts listed in his credit reports. Because of the\nage of these debts, their delinquent status, and the amount of the debt, Applicant showed an inability\nor unwillingness to pay his debts. Based on the evidence of record, the government established the\napplicability of DC \u00b6 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\nMC \u00b6 26 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment may have some application in this case. He filed his first\nbankruptcy petition to stop the foreclosure sale of his house more than 11 years ago, in 1996. Since\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n24\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\nthis action is old and was done for the sole purpose of stopping the foreclosure sale of his house, it has\nlittle relevance to his current financial issues. Since the failure to file income taxes last occurred in\n1998, it was long ago, although not infrequent. His tax liability issues arose because he is an alcoholic\nwho drank to excess on a daily basis in the 1990s, and who placed his drinking ahead of his financial\nobligations. He stopped drinking on March 7, 1999. Since this time, he has slowly worked to repair\nhis finances and other personal issues caused by his drinking. \nMC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances has\nsome applicability. His alcoholism was not a condition beyond his control or an unexpected medical\nproblem. He knew that his drinking was creating many problems, including financial and employment,\nbut he refused to accept he had a problem for a long time. In 2001, however, his employer\u2019s decision\nto lay him off in a reduction-in-force action, which had no relationship to his past drinking problems,\nimpacted his ability to improve his finances for awhile.\nApplicant never met with a financial counselor and significant back taxes are due. Thus, MC\n\u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control has no applicability.\nMC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts applies in part. Applicant\u2019s tax issues are significant. Recently, he filed for Chapter 13\nBankruptcy, which allows him to repay his debts under the protection of the bankruptcy court. He\nwaited until now to file for bankruptcy because his tax attorney recommended that he allow his unfiled\ntaxes to age. By so doing, he could include the taxes in his bankruptcy if he was current in his taxes.\nHe also attempted to obtain an equity loan on his house to help pay his tax debt, but could not get\napproval because of his past credit history.\nThe creditors for the unpaid bills in allegations 1.b through 1.h of the SOR are barred from\ncollecting these debts under the state in which he resides 3-year statute of limitations. See State Code.\nAnn. \u00a7 15-3-530.  Thus, he receives partial credit for debt resolution because these debts are no longer\n24\ncollectible. The State Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of\napplication of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\n\n8\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\nElimination of these delinquent debts, which equal only 5% of his unpaid debt, through the\nstatute of limitations has not ended his potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements\nbecause his unpaid federal taxes make him still \u201cfinancially overextended\u201d. In recent years, he has not\nincurred excessive unpaid debt. \nAlthough Applicant disputes three debts alleged in the SOR, he has not provided any evidence\nthat he has formally disputed these debts with his creditors. Thus, MC \u00b6 20 (e) the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute he legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to\nresolve the issue does not apply. Likewise, MC \u00b6 20 (f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of\nincome does not apply as there is no evidence of unusual income in this case.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of his acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nApplicant performs his duties well and is respected by his co-workers and supervisors for his\nwork ethic and integrity. He is to be praised for accepting that he is an alcoholic, for stopping his\ndrinking, and for taking steps to improve his life, especially his personal relationships. Since doing so,\nhe has slowly improved the quality of his life, including his financial management. Old debt has been\nresolved by operation of law. However, the failure to file his federal tax returns for five years and his\nfailure to correct this conduct after he stopped drinking continues to raise serious concerns under the\nAG. While recognizing he followed legal advice on how to manage his tax problems, the fact remains\nthat his federal income tax issues remain unresolved. He filed for bankruptcy protection as a means\nto resolve this issue. He is just beginning the bankruptcy process. Thus, he has not yet established a\npermanent payment plan and a track record for consistently complying with the terms of the payment\nplan. I have weighed the mitigating factors, his sobriety and accompanying change in behavior and\nattitude towards his responsibilities, including his finances, his recommendations against the\nseriousness of his failure to file his income tax returns for five years and the lack of any efforts to\nresolve this issue until recently. The seriousness of his conduct in regards to his tax issues outweighs\nthe favorable evidence and mitigating factors. Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n9\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\nmemorandum directing application of revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the Directive in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n  On June 4, 2007, Applicant submitted supplemental response to the SOR.\n3\n  GE 4 (Office of Personnel Management Security Clearance Application (SF86), dated October 19, 2004),\n4\nunless indicated otherwise, is the source for the facts in this paragraph.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  The SOR informed Applicant that, based on available information, DOHA\n1\nadjudicators could not make a preliminary, affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him access to classified information.2\nOn May 22, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, denied all the allegations, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing.  On July 9, 2007, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\n3\nMaterial (FORM), which was mailed on July 24, 2007. Applicant received it on July 30, 2007. He\nanswered the FORM on August 28, 2007, and submitted additional information for consideration\nwithin the 30-day period provided to him.

They were\nseparated from March 2002 to December 2003, and again in February 2005 to the hearing date. \n\n  GE 10, 9, 8, and 7, respectively.\n5\n  GEs 5 and 11.\n6\n  See creditor\u2019s letter of May 22, 2007, included with Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR.\n7\n  GE 11, unless otherwise stated, is the source of the facts in this paragraph.\n8\n4\nApplicant\u2019s employment history reflects that in addition to his Naval duties, he also worked\nas a pizza delivery driver from February 1998 to January 2000, and from May 2001 to March 2003.\nHe also worked as a computer technician from February 1999 to June 2000. He has been working\nfor his current employer, a government contractor, since July 2004. There is no evidence he has ever\nmishandled or compromised classified information while in the Navy or at his current job. \nIn his October 2004 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that during the last\nseven years he had six debts over 180 days delinquent, and that he was currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on two debts. The subsequent background investigation addressed Applicant\u2019s financial\nsituation and included the review of his November 2004 credit bureau report (CBR), January and\nSeptember 2006 CBRs, and his February 2007 CBR . It also included the review of Applicant\u2019s 2006\n5\nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, and his January 2006 statement to a government investigator.6\nThe SOR alleged three delinquent/charged off accounts. Applicant\u2019s evidence established,\nand the government conceded, that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s debts. She opened\nthe accounts on her own, and included him as an authorized user, however, he never used the\naccounts. Applicant disputed both debts through the credit bureaus. He was cleared of financial\nresponsibility on both accounts, and his name was removed from the accounts. Concerning SOR \u00b6\n1.c, Applicant admitted this delinquent debt. On May 22, 2007, Applicant made a loan to consolidate\nhis debts, settled the debt for $16,495, and paid it off.7\nIn late 2000, Applicant developed financial problems because of relocation expenses related\nto his permanent change of station from the west coast to the east coast of the United States, his\nwife\u2019s inability to find or keep employment at their new residence, and the expense of having to\nreplace his car.  Additionally, his spouse, who handled the household finances, developed an\n8\nalcohol/drug problem. She became financially irresponsible spending without control and\novercharged their credit card accounts. From March 2002 to December 2003, although separated\nfrom his wife, Applicant was the sole provider for his family. Additionally, he lived in a separate\napartment, which created additional expenses he was not able to afford. Applicant and his spouse\nlived together from December 2003 to February 2005. They separated again because of her continued\nabuse of alcohol and drugs. As of January 2006, she has living in a west coast halfway house,\nreceiving treatment for her alcohol and drug addiction. \nApplicant did not file for bankruptcy protection because he believes it is his responsibility\nto satisfy his debts. He considers himself an honest, hardworking, and responsible individual. He\nbelieves that his ability to protect classified information cannot be affected by his financial\ndelinquencies or his wife\u2019s alcohol and drug abuse problems. As of May 2007, Applicant was living\nseparate from his wife, and was taking care of his three daughters. He also sought financial\n\n  Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR.\n9\n  AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . .

Dec. 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n12\nthan a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199, at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\n5\ncounseling from a consumer credit counseling agency in an effort to improve his finances and learn\nto avoid future financial problems.  \n9\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant included an August 2007 personal financial\nstatement (PFS), which is consistent with the PFS he submitted in October 2006. It shows\nApplicant\u2019s net income is $6,123; his monthly expenses (including debt payments) total $5,269; and\nthat he has a monthly net remainder of approximately $854.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) which must be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. The administrative judge must take\ninto account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each AG applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an Applicant. Each decision must reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept.10\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) is the applicable relevant AG.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n11\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling\ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness\nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it\n12\n\nevidence in the record); Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, supra n.11, at 528, 531.\n13\n  See Id.; AG \u00b6 2(b).\n14\n6\nis not clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels\n13\nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information\nin favor of protecting national security.14\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the government\u2019s concern is that an\nApplicant\u2019s failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18.\nThe government established its case by showing Applicant became delinquent on the debt\nalleged in \u00b6 1.c around May 2003. He failed to resolve this debt until May 2007, when he used a debt\nconsolidation loan to pay the debt. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 19(a):\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial\nobligations, apply in this case.\nApplicant\u2019s evidence established facts that I considered as circumstances beyond his control\ncontributing to his financial problems, i.e., his family relocation, his periods of separation from his\nwife and the ultimate loss of his marriage, his retirement from the military, having a new job, and\nthe financial problems caused by his wife\u2019s spending habits because of her alcohol/drug related\nproblems. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, applies. \nApplicant provided a reasonable explanation concerning the cause of his debts and why it\ntook him so long to resolve his delinquent debt. He paid off his delinquent debt in May 2007, after\nreceipt of the SOR, but before receipt of the FORM. Arguably, he could have shown more\nresponsibility by resolving his debt sooner. Notwithstanding those factors militating against approval\nof his clearance, and considering the evidence as a whole, his favorable information is sufficient to\nestablish that he is a responsible person, that he is not financially overextended, and that his financial\nproblems are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c):  . . . there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control, applies.\n\n7\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I\nspecifically considered Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR and the FORM, his 23 years of\nmilitary service to his country, and that there is no evidence that he ever mishandled or\ncaused the compromise of classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s DD 214 shows he did well in the Navy. He earned awards and\ndecorations and held positions of leadership and responsibility reserved for those who\ndistinguish themselves for their dedication, trustworthiness, judgment, and good\nperformance of duty. His financial problems seem to be the result of those\ncircumstances beyond his control previously discussed. His income adequately covers\nhis monthly expenses, leaving him with a net remainder of approximately $850 a month.\nHe is by no means debt free, but his financial problems appear to be under control. In\nlight of his strong, past good behavior and dedicated duty performance in the Navy, I\nbelieve Applicant will continue his financial recovery and the likelihood of recurrence\nis remote. Considering all available information, and the whole person concept, I find\nApplicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive\nSection E3.1.25 are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

Prior to his current position, he was unemployed for a period of time after being\ninjured in an automobile accident. While unemployed, he accumulated debts that he was unable to\npay. He mitigated the security concerns raised by financial considerations. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 4, 2004, Applicant electronically submitted a security clearance application (SCA).\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2. (Jan. 2,\n1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 23, 2007, detailing the\nbasis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines (Guidelines) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May\n18, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was initially\nassigned to another administrative judge on June 21, 2007, and reassigned to me on August 2, 2007.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 24, 2007, setting the case for September 11, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 into\nevidence without objections. Applicant testified in his case and introduced 17 documents that I\nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through Q. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record\nopen until September 21, 2007, to give him an opportunity to submit additional information. I\nextended that deadline to September 25, 2007. On that day I received three exhibits that I marked\nas AX S through T, and admitted into evidence without objections from Department Counsel.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 21, 2007. \nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel withdrew the allegation contained\nin SOR \u00b6 1.b without an objection from Applicant.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 35 years old. He is unmarried and has one child who lives with him. He was\nborn in Iraq, but fled it along with his family in the 1990\u2019s and lived in Saudi Arabia for a period\nof time.

From December 2000 until February or March 2002, he was unemployed, as a result of an\nautomobile accident that occurred while driving a truck for a former employer. During his recovery,\nhe lived with his family. (Tr. 69). After returning to work, he drove for another trucking firm until\nhe found a job with his present employer. (Tr. 45).\nIn June 2004, Applicant started a position as a linguist with a federal contractor and\nsubmitted a SCA in July 2004. He subsequently received an interim clearance. As part of his duties\nfor his employer, Applicant trained U.S. forces in the Iraqi language and culture. He later served as\nan interpreter for the armed forces during two separate deployments to Iraq: from November 2004\nthrough March 2005, and from November 2005 until December 2006. (Tr. 70). \nAfter submitting his SCA, Applicant met with a government investigator in early 2005 and\ndiscussed his financial problems. On March 29, 2005, Applicant began meeting with a credit\ncounselor to address his financial problems with whom he continues to work. (AX S).\nBased on an August 2004 and April 2007 credit report, DOHA filed an SOR alleging that\nApplicant is indebted to four creditors for delinquent debts, totaling $24,815. The debts arose during\nthe period of time that Applicant was unemployed. The status of the debts is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6 1.a.  Applicant acknowledged the underlying debt for furniture, but denied owing\n$1,196. After he returned to work in February or March of 2002, he attempted to negotiate a\nsettlement for the balance owed of about $700, but was unsuccessful because the company insisted\nthat he pay all of the interest charges. (Tr. 46-47; 52). In April 2005, he disputed the matter through\na credit reporting agency. (Answer; Tr. 46; AX A). According to his credit counselor, the debt is\nresolved. (AX S). At this time, Applicant asserts that it was illegally re-aged by the creditor. (Tr.\n72).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c.  Applicant admitted that he owed money to this creditor, an automobile loan\ncompany, but disputed the amount. When he realized that he could not manage this debt during his\nunemployment, he requested the creditor repossess the vehicle by which time he had paid\napproximately $4,000 on a $22,000 loan. (Tr.52). The loan company sold the car for $11,000, but\ninsisted that Applicant repay the entire loan without crediting him for his payments or the proceeds\nof the sale of the car. (Tr. 34; 52-53; Answer). In April 2005, he disputed the debt with the assistance\nof his credit counselor. (AX A). According to recent information, in 2001 the amount owed was\n$15,439, the amount was $23,128 when the SOR was filed, and was $32,0000 as of September 19,\n2007.  (AX R). The credit counselor considers the matter resolved from a credit standpoint. (AX S).\n1\nIt does not appear on the August 29, 2007 credit report. (GX 2). He was previously willing to pay\nabout $7,000 to the creditor (the amount he believes he owed), but was unable to negotiate a\nresolution with the creditor. (Tr. 52-53; 72). \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.  Applicant paid the $408 telephone bill on January 1, 2006. (AX D; AX P at 19).\n\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.d.  Applicant paid the cell phone bill for $110 on November 5, 2005. (Id.; Tr. 37).\nDuring his meetings with the credit counselor, Applicant learned that the creditors in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c could no longer legally enforce the outstanding debts and that it was his option to pay\nthe debts. (Tr. 64). Up to the time of the hearing, he did not want to repay the loans because of the\nfees and charges attached to the underlying debt, however, while testifying he acknowledged that\nhe is willing to repay a fair amount. (Tr. 50).\nApplicant earns approximately $65,000 annually. (Tr. 38). His monthly expenses are about\n$3,600, leaving sufficient monies to cover his taxes and other incidentals. (AX T). A September 7,\n2007 credit report notes that Applicant\u2019s last missed payment occurred four years ago and related\nto one account. (AX O at 3). The report indicates that he has kept his non-mortgage installment loans\nlow, or below the recommended $5,000 average. (Id.). \u201cAccording to his most recent credit report,\n[Applicant] has no account that reflects an outstanding balance.\u201d (AX S)\nThroughout his deployment with the Armed Forces through his employer, Applicant received\nnumerous awards and strong recommendations. After training troops for the U.S. Army from\nDecember 2003 to February 2004, he received a Certificate of Appreciation from the Director of\nOperations. (AX F.) According to an evaluation written by a Colonel, Applicant is a dedicated\ninterpreter, who \u201cled several high level meetings and received praise from all participants\u201d during\na deployment. (AX M). On August 5, 2005, a Special Agent for the Department of Air Force wrote\na letter of recommendation that referenced his deployment from November 2004 through March\n2005. In it, he referred to Applicant as \u201creliable, loyal and a leader. I cannot say enough about\n[Applicant] and his contribution to my better understanding the Muslim culture and surviving 6\nmonths in a combat zone.\u201d (AX J). A gunnery sergeant with the Army wrote that from April 2006\nuntil October 2006, Applicant \u201cdistinguished himself both personally and professionally in all\nmatters.\u201d (AX I). One of the team leaders of another operation\u2019s group praised Applicant\u2019s\noutstanding support as an interpreter from December 2006 to March 2007. (AX K).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . .  that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at\n527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a clearance. \n\n5\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an administrative judge\nmust consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation\u201d (Guidelines). These revised Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information.\nIn addition to evaluating those disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires a thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case is known as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. Guideline \u00b6 2(c). Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the\nSOR:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems. \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d\nTwo Financial Considerations\u2019 Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a security\nconcern and be disqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201ca history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Guidelines 19(a) and (c). Based on credit reports and\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgment of the underlying debts listed in the SOR, he was unable to manage\nhis debts from approximately 2001 until recently. After the Government produced substantial\nevidence of those two disqualifying conditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate or rebut\nthe allegations. \nFour Financial Considerations\u2019 Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) under Guideline \u00b6 20 are\npotentially applicable:\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\n\n6\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to\nresolve the issue.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence, I conclude Guideline \u00b6 20(b) applies. The\ntwo large delinquent debts arose while Applicant was unemployed for 15 months, a factor beyond\nhis control. He relinquished his automobile during that time because he could not meet the payments\nand attempted to resolve that debt along with the furniture debt after he became employed in\nFebruary 2002. Those actions provide evidence of responsible behavior under the circumstances.\nGuideline \u00b6 20(c) applies because Applicant obtained credit counseling in late March 2005, which\ncontinues to the present. According to the credit counselor, all of the debts are resolved and his latest\ncredit report does not reflect outstanding balances. There is also evidence to support the\nestablishment of Guideline \u00b6 20(d) because he paid the two small debts in 2005-2006, and disputed\nthe larger two immediately after meeting with his credit counselor. Both actions demonstrate a good-\nfaith effort to pay or resolve his debts and support the application of Guidelines \u00b6 20(d) and (e).\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I considered the\ntotality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including Applicant\u2019s age, the fact\nthat he has held an interim security clearance for almost three years, while working in Iraq for the\nU.S. Armed Forces where he received very high recommendations for his work. I took into account\nthe fact that he exhibited good judgment when he sought credit counseling after an interview with\na government investigator about his financial problems, as well as his candid explanations for not\npaying two debts because of the high interest charges and inability to negotiate a settlement. I also\nconsidered the law which does not require one to have paid-off every debt in full nor contemplates\nthat this Department should become a collection agency for two disputed claims. Given his current\nawareness of the impact that his financial situation has on his employment, and his current income\nand budget, along with his credit counselor\u2019s assistance, I believe he will continue to monitor and\nresolve his obligations. At this time I find that he does not pose a security risk and the allegations\nunder Paragraph 1 of the SOR are concluded for him. Accordingly, Guideline F is found in his favor.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n7\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a , 1.c, 1.d and 1.e: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

In support of that contention, he points to his lengthy and significant ties to the United\nStates and argues that his family located in Morocco present no trustworthiness concern.  The Board\nremands the case for further processing.\nIn this case, the Judge\u2019s decision contains no findings or conclusions about the nature of the\nMoroccan government or the nature of potential threats posed by any groups operating within that\ncountry.  The Judge\u2019s failure to make findings and conclusions concerning the geopolitical situation\nwithin Morocco, including the security/intelligence profile of the country vis-a-vis the United States,\nimpairs his analysis, both of the Guideline B concerns and the whole-person.

Finding no error, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s remand decision.\nIn his second appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination\nshould be reversed because he does not have access to sensitive information and his position should\nnot require a trustworthiness designation.  He also argues that because of his lengthy and significant\nties to the United States, his family located in Morocco present no trustworthiness concerns.  As part\nof his brief, Applicant attaches new evidence, a character reference letter, signed by 14 colleagues,\nwhich attests to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, honesty and loyalty.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge had to evaluate the facts and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s situation in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide whether Applicant\nhad met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The fact that Applicant\u2019s explanations\nand his mitigating evidence did not lead the Judge to the decision desired by Applicant does not\nestablish error.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make\na favorable trustworthiness determination.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written administrative record.  As a result,\nthe Judge did not have an opportunity to question him about his family ties and evaluate his\ncredibility in the context of a hearing.  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge\nweighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying\ncircumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.\nHe adequately explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns and why Applicant's\ncircumstances could potentially make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.  That\nconcern is based on close family ties in Morocco, considered in the context of the overall\npolitical/security profile of that country vis-a-vis the United States.  Applicant offers an alternative\ninterpretation of the record evidence.  However, that alternative interpretation of the record evidence\nis insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s interpretation arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-04371 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007).

His mother and seven siblings\nreside in Morocco; one sibling resides in a third country and another resides in the United States.\nOne of applicant\u2019s siblings is a high-ranking Moroccan government official, and as such, is  an agent\nof Morocco.\nApplicant traveled to Morocco in at least 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002 to visit his family.

In addition to being subject to all Moroccan laws, U.S. citizens who also\npossess the nationality of Morocco may be subject to other laws that impose special obligations\non citizens of that country.\u201d Consular Information Sheet, page 4. \n3\ncommunicates with his mother every three to four weeks by telephone, and with his siblings once\na month by telephone.\nIn a written statement he gave to the OPM in October 2004, applicant stated he owned a \u201cplot\nof farm land\u201d in Morocco. In his response to the SOR, he stated he no longer owns any property in\nMorocco. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant\u2019s mother and nine siblings are citizens of Morocco,\nand that his mother and seven of his siblings reside in Morocco. The evidence further establishes that\none of applicant\u2019s siblings is a high-ranking government official and thus an agent of Morocco.\nThese facts require application of Disqualifying Conditions E2.A2.1.2.1 (an immediate family\nmember . . . is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country) and E2.A2.1.2.3 (relatives\n. . . who are connected with any foreign government).\nOnce the Government established that Disqualifying Condition E2.A2.1.2.1 applied, the\nburden shifted to applicant to provide facts that support the application of  Mitigating Condition\nE2.A2.1.3.1 (a determination that the immediate family member(s) . . . in question are not agents\nof a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the\nindividual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States). Applicant did\nnot meet his burden for two reasons: First, one of his siblings is an agent of Morocco. Second, the\nlimited evidence he presented does not establish his immediate family members are not in a position\nto be exploited in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to those family members and\nloyalty to the United States.\nIn reaching my decision in this case, I have considered the factors set forth in Section E2.2\nof the Directive. On balance, they do not help applicant. Applicant has lived in the United States for\nmany years, married a native-born American, and has worked and raised his two children here. These\nare factors in his favor. However, he is still a Moroccan citizen,  which leaves him connected to, and\n1\nis some respects obligated to, Morocco.  He voluntarily maintains close and regular contact with his\n2\nimmediate family members in Morocco, one of whom is a high-ranking Moroccan official. This\nclose contact includes trips to Morocco every two to three years. These trips significantly increase\nhis vulnerability to foreign influence, particularly since he is a citizen of Morocco.   In view of the\n3\nforegoing, Guideline B is found against applicant.\n\n4\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nGUIDELINE B: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Edmonds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s mother and nine siblings are citizens of Morocco. One sibling is a high-ranking\nMoroccan government official. Applicant has strong ties of affection to these immediate family\nmembers. He maintains regular, close contact with them. Determination of Trustworthiness is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care System Program Office (CHCSPO), the\n\nIdentifying the position the brother occupies could lead to applicant\u2019s identification.\n1\n2\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I), entered into a Memorandum of\nAgreement which gave DOHA the responsibility to provide trustworthiness determinations for\ncontractor personnel employed in Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation\n5200.2R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987.\nOn August 31, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness,\nsuitability, and eligibility for applicant to hold a sensitive Information Systems Position (ADP-\nI/II/III).\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 25, 2006, and elected to have his\ncase determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment's written case (FORM) on or about February 16, 2007. Applicant filed a response to the\nFORM on or about March 29, 2007. The case was assigned to me on April 16, 2007, and a decision\nwas issued on May 9, 2007. On October 1, 2007, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case to me\nfor issuance of a new decision.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s Motion to amend SOR Paragraph 1.b., set forth on page 4 of the\nFORM, is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 56 years of age. He was born in Morocco. He became a United States citizen in\n1992. His spouse, to whom he has been married since 1984, was born in the United States. Their two\nchildren were born in the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and nine siblings are citizens of Morocco. His mother and seven siblings\nreside in Morocco; one sibling resides in a third country and another resides in the United States.\nOne of applicant\u2019s siblings is a very high-ranking Moroccan government official,  and as such, is\n1\nan agent of Morocco.\nApplicant traveled to Morocco in at least 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002 to visit his family. He\ncommunicates with his mother every three to four weeks by telephone, and with his siblings once\na month by telephone.\nIn a written statement he gave to the OPM in October 2004, applicant stated he owned a \u201cplot\nof farm land\u201d in Morocco. In his response to the SOR, he stated he no longer owns any property in\nMorocco.\n \n\n3\nI take administrative notice of the following:\n1. Morocco, located in North Africa, is a constitutional monarchy, wherein ultimate power\nresides with the King, who may, at his discretion, terminate the tenure of any minister, dissolve the\nParliament, call for new elections, or rule by decree. The King is the head of the military and the\nreligious leader of the majority Sunni Moslem population. Morocco is recognized as a moderate\nArab state. United States-Moroccan relations, characterized by mutual respect and friendship, have\nremained strong through cooperation and sustained high-level dialogue.(Background Note Morocco,\nU.S. Department of State, July 2006; Government Document for Administrative Notice I.)\n2. Morocco considers all persons born to Moroccan fathers to be Moroccan citizens. In\naddition to being subject to all Moroccan laws, United States citizens who possess the nationality\nof Morocco may be subject to other laws that impose special obligations on citizens of that country.\n(Government Document for Administrative Notice II.)\n3. In May 2003, Moroccan suicide bombers affiliated with the Salafiya Jihadiya movement\nattacked sites in Casablanca, killing 45 people. Subsequently, Moroccan authorities arrested seven\nindividuals from a Salafiya Jihadiya cell suspected of planning further attacks in that country.\nAuthorities linked these seven individuals to six Moroccans whom Algerian authorities had returned\nto Morocco after their arrest while training with militants from the Algerian terrorist group GSPC.\nLater that year, Moroccan authorities dismantled a 17 member incipient terrorist network that was\nlinked to small terrorist groups in Iraq. Moroccan-born extremists were implicated in the March 2004\ntrain blasts in Madrid. The potential for violence against American interests and citizens remains\nhigh in Morocco. (Consular Information Sheet, Morocco, U.S. Department of State, January 2007;\nGovernment Document for Administrative Notice II.) (Country Reports on Terrorism 2005, U.S.\nDepartment of State, April 2006; Government Document for Administrative Notice III.)\n \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant\u2019s mother and nine siblings are citizens of Morocco,\nand that his mother and seven of his siblings reside in Morocco. The evidence further establishes that\none of applicant\u2019s siblings is a very high-ranking government official, and thus an agent of Morocco.\n \nA Guideline B concern exists when an individual seeking a favorable trustworthiness\ndetermination is bound by ties of affection, influence, or obligation to immediate family in a foreign\ncountry. A person who places a high value on family obligations or fidelity to relationships in\nanother country may be vulnerable to duress by the intelligence service of the foreign country or by\nagents or residents from that country engaged in industrial espionage, terrorism or other criminal\nactivity. The more faithful an individual is to family ties and obligations, the more likely the chance\nthat the ties might be exploited to the detriment of the United States. Having an immediate family\nmember occupy a high-ranking position in another country only heightens the risk.\nThe application of disqualifying conditions under Guideline B is not limited to countries\nhostile to the United States. ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004.) The United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding sensitive information from persons,\norganizations, or countries not authorized to have access to it, even if their interests are not opposed\nto those of the United States. Moreover, history has demonstrated that individuals have wrongfully\n\n In his 2004 written statement to the OPM, applicant claimed he remains a Moroccan\n2\ncitizen because Moroccan government policy prohibits the renunciation of Moroccan citizenship\nin situations like his.\nIn his 2004 written statement to the OPM, he stated, \u201cI do understand my rights,\n3\nprivileges and obligations to both the United States and Morocco.\u201d\n As noted in the Findings of Fact, Morocco considers all persons born to Moroccan\n4\nfathers to be Moroccan citizens. Accordingly, the Moroccan government still considers applicant\nto be a Moroccan citizen. This means that while in Morocco, applicant may be subject to other\n4\npassed sensitive information to countries not hostile to the United States, and terrorist acts against\nthe United States and its allies have been carried out by individuals residing in or citizens of\ncountries not hostile to the United States. Applicant's case requires the recognition that international\nterrorist groups are operating in Morocco and the surrounding region. American citizens with\nimmediate family members who are citizens and residents of Morocco could be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nThe facts of this case require application of Disqualifying Conditions E2.A2.1.2.1 (an\nimmediate family member . . . is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country),\nE2.A2.1.2.3 (relatives . . . who are connected with any foreign government), and E2.A2.1.2.6.\n(conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a\nforeign government).\nAn applicant may mitigate foreign influence security concerns by demonstrating that foreign\nfamily members are not agents of a foreign power and are not in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force an applicant to choose between loyalty to the foreign family\nmembers and loyalty to the United States. (Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.1.)  Since applicant\u2019s\nbrother is a high-ranking agent of the Moroccan government, this mitigating condition is not\napplicable.\nAn applicant may also mitigate foreign influence security concerns if he shows his contacts\nand correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent. (Mitigating Condition\nE2.A2.1.3.3.)  In view of applicant\u2019s regular and frequent contact with his mother and siblings, this\nmitigating condition is not applicable.\nIn reaching my decision in this case, I have also considered the factors set forth in Section\nE2.2 of the Directive. On balance, they do not help applicant. Applicant has lived in the United\nStates for many years, married a native-born American, and has worked and raised his two children\nhere. These are factors in his favor. However, he is still a Moroccan citizen,  which leaves him\n2\nconnected to, and is some respects obligated to, Morocco.  He voluntarily maintains close and\n3\nregular contact with his immediate family members in Morocco, one of whom is a very high-ranking\nMoroccan official. This close contact includes trips to Morocco every two to three years. These trips\nsignificantly increase his vulnerability to foreign influence, particularly since he is a citizen of\nMorocco.   In view of the foregoing, Guideline B is found against applicant.\n4\n\nlaws that impose special obligations on citizens of that country.\n5\nThere is nothing in the evidence that suggests applicant is not a loyal American citizen and\na credit to his adopted country. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Therefore, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this\ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to applicant's allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism. He simply was unable to put forward evidence that could mitigate the security\nconcerns discussed herein and demonstrate that he would not be vulnerable to foreign influence that\nwould result in the compromise of sensitive information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nGUIDELINE B: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability and\neligibility for applicant to hold a sensitive Information Systems Position.\n____________________________\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact3 Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant was born in 1948 in the Philippines (GE 5). She was married in 1984 and divorced in 1986 (GE 5). She married again in 1989 and divorced in 1992 (GE 5). Applicant attended medical school from 1969 to 1972 in the Philippines, graduating magna cum laude (Tr. 63; GE 5; AE A). She completed her residency in New York State (AE A). She received a medical license in three states (Tr. 63).

Applicant\u2019s court-martial and dismissal from \nmilitary service were more than 13 years ago. Her subsequent conduct establishes that \nshe is rehabilitated. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 22, 2003, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 5). On April 22, 2007, Applicant submitted another SF 86 (GE \n5). On July 2, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to her (GE 11), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \nDecember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position, which permits access to sensitive \ninformation, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nsuch access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 20, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to \nhave her case decided by a hearing before an administrative judge (GE 12). On \nOctober 16, 2008, the case was assigned to me. On October 20, 2008, notice was \nissued and on October 27, 2008, amended notice was issued for the hearing, which \nwas held on November 25, 2008. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight \nexhibits (GEs 1-8) (Transcript (Tr.) 25), and Applicant offered 13 exhibits (Tr. 27-29, \n107; AE A-M). There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-8 (Tr. 26-27), and AEs \nA-M (Tr. 28-29, 107). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and two \nHearing Notices (GEs 9-12). I received the transcript on December 4, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Issues2 \n \nThe SOR cited facts that would have brought Applicant\u2019s case under the \nprohibitions of the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986), because she was convicted \nand sentenced to punishments including dismissal from the Air Force for offenses under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). However, this section of the United States \nCode, which applied only to clearances granted by DoD, was repealed on January 28, \n2008, when the President signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2008 into law. It was replaced by adding Sec. 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435b (the Bond \nAmendment), which applies throughout the Federal Government. Sec. 3002(c) of this \nnew provision continues the requirement for disqualification, absent a meritorious \nwaiver, for persons who were sentenced to and served imprisonment for more than a \nyear. However, this disqualification only applies to prevent clearances that would \nprovide access to special access programs (SAP), Restricted Data (RD), or any other \ninformation commonly referred to as \u201cspecial compartmented information\u201d (SCI). \n \nThis statutory modification ends the former Smith Amendment requirement for a \nmeritorious Secretarial waiver to grant or continue a regular, or \u201ccollateral,\u201d security \nclearance to a person who has received a dismissal from the Air Force. On June 20, \n2008, prior to the issuance of the SOR and the hearing in this case, the Under \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n2Administrative Judge White cogently explained the interplay between the Smith Act, the Bond \nAmendment and revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) J in ISCR Case No. 07-11963 (A.J. Aug. 20, 2008). \nI have borrowed freely and extensively without further citation from his explanation in this section.   \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nSecretary of Defense (Intelligence) issued a memorandum providing interim guidance \nfor implementation of the Bond Amendment. This memorandum set forth guidance for \nadjudicators to assess the potential application of the Bond Amendment to security \nclearance determinations and requirements for \u201cException\u201d identification of persons \nsubject to its limitations in the Joint Adjudication Management System (JAMS) if a \ncollateral clearance is granted. The granting of access to SAP, RD or SCI to such \nindividuals requires a meritorious waiver under the terms of that memorandum. Such \naccess is not at issue in this case, and accordingly the Bond Amendment was not \naddressed in either the SOR or at the hearing. \n \nThe repeal of the Smith Amendment also nullified the legal authority by which the \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Intelligence modified the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) that were approved by the President on December 29, 2005. When the \nUnder Secretary promulgated the AG for use within DoD, on August 30, 2006, he added \nprovisions reflecting the Smith Amendment. AG H (Drug Involvement), AG I \n(Psychological Conditions), and AG J (Criminal Conduct) were each modified, but only \nthe latter guideline is involved in this case. It was modified by adding AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(f), 32(e), \nand footnotes 1 and 2. Because the President, in Executive Order 12968, intended to \nestablish \u201ca uniform Federal personnel security program\u201d (Intro.), and required a \n\u201ccommon set of adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified \ninformation\u201d (Sec. 3.1(f).), the authority for these DoD modifications to the guidelines \nended with the repeal of the Smith Amendment. The new statutory requirements are in \neffect and must be followed pending formal revision of the AG, but only the prohibition \nagainst granting clearances to unlawful drug users and addicts under AG H applies to \n\u201ccollateral\u201d security clearances. Accordingly, the Smith Amendment-related provisions \nadded to AG J have been repealed, and do not apply to the remaining proceedings in \nthis case.     \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant was born in 1948 in the Philippines (GE 5). She was married in 1984 \nand divorced in 1986 (GE 5). She married again in 1989 and divorced in 1992 (GE 5). \nApplicant attended medical school from 1969 to 1972 in the Philippines, graduating \nmagna cum laude (Tr. 63; GE 5; AE A). She completed her residency in New York State \n(AE A). She received a medical license in three states (Tr. 63). Applicant joined the \nmilitary as a general surgeon in July 1981 (Tr. 64; GE 5).  \n \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nCriminal Conduct4 \n \n \nIn June 1995, Applicant was convicted contrary to her pleas by a general court-\nmartial with members of dereliction of duty, signing a false official document and larceny \nof government funds, in violation of Articles 92, 107, and 121, UCMJ; 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 892, \n907 and 921. She was sentenced to total forfeitures, confinement for six months and \ndismissal from the Air Force. She was released early from confinement at Fort \nLeavenworth because of good behavior (Tr. 74).  \n  \n \nPrior to her court-martial, Applicant completed 14 years of outstanding service as \na board certified surgeon and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. The day she was \nscheduled to be promoted to Colonel she learned she would not be promoted because \nshe was under investigation for larceny of housing allowances (Tr. 74). At the time of \nher offenses and court-martial, she was assigned to an overseas command in the Far \nEast. Applicant\u2019s mother died on December 19, 1991, and Applicant was divorced on \nJanuary 18, 1992 (Tr. 68, 91). She learned her divorce was final in October 1992, and \nthe members modified the findings to reflect when she learned of her change of status \n(Tr. 69; GE 1 at 442). Her entitlement to receive dependent allowances terminated \nwhen she was divorced. She notified the personnel office of her divorce; however, she \nfailed to notify the finance office of her divorce (Tr. 70, 97, 102). Her notification to \npersonnel was apparently not documented in her personnel records at the time she \nmade this disclosure. Applicant continued to receive more allowances than she was \nentitled to receive.  \n \n \nIn December 1993, Applicant signed a document certifying her entitlement to \ndependent allowances (Tr. 91). She listed her deceased mother as her dependent (Tr. \n91). She also listed her deceased mother as a dependent on her 1992 and 1993 income \ntax returns (Tr. 92). Her tax returns indicate her mother lived with her for 12 months of \nthe 1992 and 1993 tax years (Tr. 93-94). When she was about to change duty stations, \na personnel specialist, who was preparing her orders, asked about the status of her \nhusband. At first, she said she was separated from her husband and he need not be \nlisted on her orders. The personnel specialist replied that until there was a divorce, he \ncould be listed on her orders. Applicant then informed the personnel specialist that she \nwas divorced.  However she falsely reiterated that her mother was her dependent. After \ncourt-martial charges were preferred, Applicant reimbursed the government about \n$23,000 for the overpayment of her housing allowance (Tr. 73). She subsequently \namended her tax returns to correct the false information submitted in her 1992 and 1993 \ntax returns (Tr. 115-116). \n \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s court-martial she claimed she was unaware that she was receiving \nthe extra pay by virtue of the false dependent information that she provided to finance \n \n4 Applicant admitted the appellate court decision, dated November 27, 1996, which affirmed her \nfindings and sentence, accurately described her background, her criminal conduct and the processing of \nher court-martial conviction and sentence (Tr. 68, 100; GE 3). Unless stated otherwise, this appellate \ncourt decision is the source for the information in this section.   \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(Tr. 95-96). She said she did not remember signing the false certification in December \n1993 concerning her mother\u2019s continuing status as a dependent (Tr. 98).    \n \nPost-trial Actions \n \n \nAfter her court-martial, Applicant lost her license to practice medicine (Tr. 72-74). \nShe practiced medicine in the Philippines from 1996 to 2000 (Tr. 75). She provided \nmedical services in a poor village and was usually paid with food such as rice or \nchickens (Tr. 77-79). She often provided surgery in the Philippines without charging for \nher services (AE A). In 2000, her debts were discharged using bankruptcy; however, \nher credit is good now (Tr. 76, 80).  Her September 17, 2008, credit report showed four \nopen accounts and no delinquent information (AE H). From 2000 to 2002, she typed \nsome transcripts and babysat children (Tr. 79). In 2002, she began her work for \ngovernment contractors (Tr. 79). She told Mr. C, her employer, about the court-martial \nthe first day she met him (Tr. 83). Since 2004, Applicant has worked with sensitive \npatient and provider information (Tr. 84-85). She carefully safeguards the privacy \ninformation entrusted to her (Tr. 85-90). Applicant was remorseful about her misconduct \n(Tr. 76). None of the offenses have recurred (Tr. 90).  After her conviction she is extra \ncareful about signing things and avoiding doing anything that might be construed as \nfalse (Tr. 100-101). \n \n     \n \nRecommendations and Achievements \n \n \n \nThe President and CEO of the government contractor employing Applicant (Mr. \nC) has known Applicant about six years (Tr. 15). Mr. C retired from the Navy after 24 \nyears service with the rank of Commander (Tr. 16-17). Applicant disclosed her court-\nmartial before she was hired (Tr. 18, 22-23). Applicant began working for the contractor \nin August 2002 (Tr. 17). In 2003, the contractor initially submitted Applicant\u2019s clearance \nrequest, and she was awarded an interim ADP clearance (Tr. 17). She currently has \naccess to sensitive information (Tr. 23). Applicant works in the area of medical \ncredentialing and quality assurance (Tr. 20). She works side-by-side with active duty \nmedical personnel (Tr. 20-21). Mr. C described Applicant as a valued employee with \nexcellent to outstanding work performance (Tr. 19-20). Applicant is very trustworthy (Tr. \n21).  \n \n \nColonel (Ret.) (COL) S has known Applicant for 27 years (Tr. 31).  COL S and \nApplicant worked together for two years before Applicant\u2019s court-martial, and they \nstayed in touch over the years thereafter (Tr. 32). When she was on active duty, \nApplicant distinguished herself for her positive relationships with patients and staff at the \nhospital (Tr. 33). COL S drove from New Mexico to Arlington, Virginia to speak on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf (Tr. 34). Applicant has demonstrated through hard work and initiative \nthat she has been rehabilitated (Tr. 35-38, 42-43). Applicant is very honest and \ntrustworthy (Tr. 34-35, 37-37).     \n \n \nCommander (Ret.) (CMDR) L served on active duty for 25 years and retired as a \nCommander in 1998 (Tr. 46). CMDR L was previously a director for the contractor who \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhired Applicant (Tr. 46, 50). He came to Applicant\u2019s hearing from Colorado (Tr. 45). \nApplicant was responsible for developing and improving verification and documentation \nof health care providers\u2019 credentials (Tr. 47-48). She worked with the highest levels of \nthe Services\u2019 medical departments including their Surgeon Generals (Tr. 56). Applicant \ndid an excellent job and her contributions to the Department of Defense are \n\u201ctremendous\u201d (Tr. 54, 57). CMDR L would trust Applicant with his life (Tr. 56). Despite \nher court-martial, CMDR L recommended her for a position with access to sensitive \ngovernment information and believes she is highly trustworthy (Tr. 51-55, 58-59). \n \nAn August 2006 letter of appreciation from a Major General in the Office of the \nSurgeon General described a critically important topic Applicant presented at a \nsymposium as an outstanding success (AE B). A December 2006 letter of appreciation \nfrom a Colonel at the Department of Defense level warmly thanked Applicant and other \ncontractor employees for her guidance, tireless efforts and superb work product (AE C).  \nShe received several certificates and a memorandum of appreciation for her work on \nbehalf of the contractor (AE D, E, F). The contractor\u2019s 2007 annual evaluation for her \nperformance rated her outstanding in ten categories, exceeds expectations in seven \ncategories and meets expectations in one category (AE G). The contractor\u2019s comments \non the 2007 annual rating emphasized her strong leadership, solid reliability and \noutstanding judgment (AE G).   \n \nOther character witnesses who have known Applicant for many years and some \nfor decades lauded her contributions to her employer, hard work, diligence, dedication, \nfriendliness, positive attitude, honesty and trustworthiness (AE A, J, K, L). Senior \npersonnel, such as a medical doctor (AE A), a retired Colonel (AE J) and a retired Navy \nCaptain (AE L) provided written character references. \n \nApplicant has contributed her services to charity and family for many years. She \nhas always supported her sister, who is mentally handicapped (Tr. 65). Every two years \nApplicant tried to return to the Philippines to provide pro bono surgical services at a \nclinic (Tr. 66). She tutors illiterate people twice a week in the United States (Tr. 67; AE \nI). She also volunteers in other worthy endeavors such as collecting food for the poor \n(Tr. 67).     \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government\u2019s authority to restrict access to \nclassified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access \nto information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or \nhis designee to grant Applicants eligibility for access to classified or sensitive \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ninformation \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ndo so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. \n20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance or a public trust position is predicated upon the \nApplicant meeting the criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information and sensitive information. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by \nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance or \npublic trust determination. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified or sensitive information. The government has the \nburden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at \n531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. \nSee ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance \n[or access to sensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, \n2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant trustworthiness concern is under Guidelines J (Criminal \nConduct) and E (Personal Conduct).  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes six conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and \nmay be disqualifying: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable \nconditions;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program; and \n \n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year.  \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b) and 31(c) apply. Applicant was convicted of two felony-level \noffenses and one misdemeanor at her general court-martial in 1995. Specifically, the \ncourt-martial found her guilty of dereliction of duty, signing a false official document and \nlarceny of government funds. She admitted that she committed the three criminal \noffenses. She was sentenced to total forfeitures, confinement for six months and \ndismissal from the Air Force.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns: \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply to mitigate the criminal conduct. Applicant's last \noffense resulting in a conviction occurred prior to her June 1995 court-martial, more \nthan 13 years ago. She served her sentence to confinement and paid full restitution to \nthe government. She frequently volunteers in her community. She worked for three \nyears in the Philippines after her trial providing surgical services to villagers for almost \nno remuneration, which provided a lengthy period to contemplate her poor judgment \nand theft of government funds. She has changed her lifestyle and her environment. She \nis no longer a practicing physician or Air Force officer. Her criminal offenses are unlikely \nto recur because they had a devastating impact on her lifestyle and medical career. Her \ndemonstrated intent not to commit future crimes is encompassed in these two mitigating \nconditions. She has demonstrated remorse and been reformed. She has worked with \ninformation technology for six years and has a good employment record. There is a \nstrong evidentiary record in this case showing her full rehabilitation for the particular \noffenses resulting in her charges and convictions. At her hearing she demonstrated her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment through her candor at her hearing \nabout the offenses. She was very remorseful and sincere in her acceptance of \nresponsibility and her declaration of culpability.   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is explicitly and most specifically covered under the criminal \nconduct guideline. Aside from her criminal conduct and behavior directly related to the \ncriminal offenses, there is no other adverse information. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(d) do not apply.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nHowever, there is an issue in any personal conduct case when criminal conduct \ninvolving false documents and larceny are established. Such conduct shows \n\u201cquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations.\u201d Such misconduct raises questions about Applicant\u2019s \u201creliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified [or sensitive] information.\u201d See AG \u00b6 15. \nApplicant engaged in personal conduct \u201cthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d Clearly her criminal \nconduct and dismissal from the Air Force are activities that adversely affect her \npersonal, professional and community standing.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \nin this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d) and 17(e) apply. Applicant disclosed her court-martial \nconviction to her employer before she was hired and listed it on her security clearance \napplications. At her hearing, she fully and frankly described her criminal conduct. She \nhas taken the positive step of disclosure to her employer and security officials, ending \nany vulnerability to exploitation or duress. The offenses occurred more than 13 years \nago, and have not recurred. She was held accountable, paid her restitution and served \nher confinement. She has served the poor and illiterate in the Philippines and United \nStates. She has performed very well for her employer for six years and has \ndemonstrated her reliability and trustworthiness. For all the reasons indicated in the \nprevious section, and this section, I conclude she has been rehabilitated and \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or public trust position by considering the \ntotality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance or public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nWhole Person Concept. Applicant committed serious offenses in 1992 and 1993. She \nfailed to inform the finance office about her divorce and her mother\u2019s death. She falsely \ncertified she had a dependent to the finance section. She received about $23,000 in \nhousing allowance to which she was not entitled. She falsified her federal tax returns in \n1992 and 1993 when she claimed her deceased mother as a dependent and illegally \nfailed to pay some of her income taxes. Applicant\u2019s deliberate misconduct is serious and \nshe received a significant punishment. The court-martial sentence included a dismissal, \na punishment reserved for situations involving serious misconduct by an officer. She \nlost her licenses to practice medicine in the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mitigating information is more compelling. A court-martial held \nApplicant accountable for her misconduct in 1995. She paid restitution, served her \nconfinement, amended her tax returns and paid her income taxes. In the 13 years that \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfollowed her court-martial, she has not committed any new offenses. At her hearing, she \nwas candid about her misconduct and very remorseful. She provided full and complete \ninformation on her security clearance applications and at her hearing. I do not have any \nquestions or concerns about her current ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. \n \nApplicant also receives substantial credit for her strong support from credible \nwitnesses concerning her efforts to reform and rehabilitate herself after 1995. Her work \nfor a defense contractor is excellent to outstanding, and aside from the SOR allegations \nno other disciplinary or trustworthiness-related problems surfaced. Her record of good \nemployment weighs in her favor. There is very compelling evidence of her responsibility, \nrehabilitation and mitigation. I am convinced that she is loyal to her family, her company \nand her country.   \n \n  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has mitigated \ntrustworthiness concerns pertaining to criminal conduct and personal conduct. I take \nthis position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and supporting evidence, \nmy application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my \ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or \novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible to \noccupy an ADP I/II/III position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an \nADP I/II/III position. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant mitigated financial security concerns relating to delinquent debts arising from\nfamily debts incurred in 2002 and 2003 by completion of bankruptcy proceedings in 2006. He has\nre-financed a motorcycle debt on which he is making regular payment. All other debts have been\nsatisfied. Applicant has held a security clearance for nearly 30 years both as a civilian and during 18\nyears of active duty in the Navy without incident. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn October 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn November 3, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another judge on December 21, 2006, and re-assigned to me on January\n5, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on January 24, 2007, for a hearing on February 27, 2007, and\nheld that day. The government offered in evidence six exhibits and Applicant offered seven. All were\nadmitted. The transcript was received on March 5, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the specifics of all of the SOR allegations relating to bankruptcy but\ndenied the three allegations about specific debts. After a complete review of the record, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor where he has been employed for\nten years as an electronic security systems technician. On May 14, 2004, he filed for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy for debts of approximately $20,000 incurred in 2002 and 2003. After making payments\nof $1,100 per month for nearly two years his bankruptcy was converted to Chapter 7 on July 25,\n2006, and the balance of his debts were discharged on October 24, 2006 (Exh. A). He took several\npart time jobs during this period to be able to make the bankruptcy payments. He was advised by a\nbankruptcy attorney during all these steps. He believed at the time he engaged those services that he\nwas to receive credit counseling but instead was advised to file bankruptcy which he now thinks was\nunnecessary in view of his assets and income and regrets having done so. His initial filing under\nChapter 13 was because his income did not qualify for Chapter 7. Two years later after making\npayments, his expenses rose because of payments he was making on a home his wife had purchased\nand counsel advised him that, as a result, he was qualified to convert to a Chapter 7 to eliminate the\n\n3\nbalance of what was then owed. He did so. \nApplicant has been divorced twice and re-married in 2003. He has two daughters from former\nmarriages. One is a minor for whom he pays child support. In 2002 he was behind on those payments\nbut is now current. The second divorce was a principal reason for his debt problems arising from loss\nof a joint income, division of property, and obligations he assumed for his former wife. His monthly\nsalary is $5,000 from his employer and an additional $1,000 from his military retirement. His assets\nare nearly $450,000 (Exh. C).\nThe following is an analysis of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR and their current\nstatus:\n1. Par. 1.a.: Credit card debt of $2,753 taken out with former wife and included in the\nbankruptcy. Payments were made during Chapter 13 proceedings and balance discharged in\nChapter 7. \n2. Par. 1.b: Debt to Navy Federal Credit Union for $5,970 for motorcycle. This debt was not\nin bankruptcy and was re-financed in September 2006 (Exh. B) with payments required of\n$169 per month but actual payments of $300 to $500 per month have been made (Exh. E).\n3. Par. 1.c.:Debt of $4,064 for a motor home that was re-possessed after his second divorce.\nThis amount was the difference in the balance owed on the home and amount recovered by\nthe creditor in repossession. This was included in bankruptcy and balance discharged. \nThe last two allegations (d) and (e) in the SOR concern the facts related to the filing of the\nChapter 13 and conversion to Chapter 7. \nOne other repossession was acknowledged at Question 35 and 38 of his SF 86. This was for\na truck on which Applicant was co-signer on a note with his son who used the vehicle and had been\nmaking payments. The son defaulted on payments and the truck was re-possessed without\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge. The son died and Applicant included this debt of $7,000 in his bankruptcy.\nApplicant is well regarded by his employer for his work as a well-motivated, competent, and\nreliable performer (Exh. D). He has held a security clearance since 1977 when he was first on active\nduty with the Navy. He took early retirement after 18 years as an E5, with an honorable discharge\nand retirement pay. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\n\n4\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence,\nthat conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may\ndisqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information See Egan, 484 U.S.\nat 531. \nThe applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concerns under Guideline\nF since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. (AG \u00b6 18) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude a history of not meeting financial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c), and evidence of inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts. (AG \u00b6 19 a ) Mitigating Conditions (MC) might include the fact that\nthe person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG\n\u00b6 20 d).\nWhile Applicant a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged only in 2006, he paid on those\ndebts while the debts were part of a Chapter 13. His present income indicates that he has sufficient\nassets and income to avoid future financial problems. \nMitigating conditions apply since the problems have now been resolved to the satisfaction\nof all the creditors with the ability to resolve the one debt that remain through a payment program\nin effect. An applicant is not required to prove that all delinquent debts are resolved to be granted\na security clearance, but only that efforts be made to resolve the debts and to show that the matters\nare being diligently pursued with an ability to resolve them. From the documentation submitted by\nApplicant, I have no difficulty in making that determination. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\n\n5\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant\nestablished that he is a hard-working professional. His debts accumulated but he has resolved all of\nthem satisfactorily and has the financial means to remain out of debt.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Applicant\nhas held a security clearance for 30 years with no problems. He holds a responsible position and is\na respected employee of his company. He has had some financial problems but the amounts in\nquestion were not extensive compared to his annual income and his assets. Also, they are not now\nand have not been so great as to create any significant potential for pressure that would give rise to\nsecurity concerns. He made some errors of judgment based on professional advice he received but\nmight have resolved the financial problems without the need for bankruptcy. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, I conclude that a security clearance should\nbe granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant.

She has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about\nher finances under the whole person concept as her unpaid debt belongs to her estranged husband.\nThe government did not establish that she intentionally falsified her answers on her SF-85P.\nEligibility for a position of trust is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 18, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On August 17, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nIn a sworn statement dated September 11, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.\nShe requested a hearing on February 5, 2007. On February 7, 2007, the government filed a Motion\nto Amend the SOR. DOHA assigned this case to me on February 8, 2007, and issued a notice of\nhearing on March 2, 2007. At the hearing on March 21, 2007, Applicant indicated that she received\nthe notice of the hearing 15 days prior to the hearing. I conducted the hearing as scheduled.  After\n2\nargument, I granted the government\u2019s Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons with Applicant\u2019s\nagreement. The language \u201cparagraph 3-614, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R and\u201d in the first paragraph of\nthe SOR is deleted.3\nThe government submitted five exhibits (GE) which were marked and admitted into the record\nas GE 1-5, without objection. Applicant submitted 7 exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and\nadmitted as App Ex A-G, without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits to all the SOR allegations under Guideline F.

In addition, after a thorough and careful review of\nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant, a 54-year-old woman and high school graduate, works as a records clerk for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor, and seeks a position of public trust. She has worked for her\nemployer for almost 10 years.  \n5\nApplicant married 27 years ago. At that time, she worked in the banking industry. In 1989,\nshe, her husband and her son moved from their home in the north to the south. After this, she started\nworking two jobs, one job full-time and the other job part-time, in the retail industry, earning a\nmodest income.

She worked part-time at a grocery store for awhile, and for the last\nseveral years during the summer months, she also works part-time at a local marina and restaurant.6\nSince moving in 1989, Applicant provided the primary financial support to the family. Her\nhusband is an alcoholic, who has worked on and off for the last 18 years.  For the last one and half\n7\nyears, her husband has resided in a nursing home, but she does not know where. She has not had any\ncontact with him for awhile and prefers not to have any contact with him. Her son is 25 years old and\nrecently moved back into her home for moral support. She has an 18-month-old grandson.8\nApplicant purchased a trailer home, where she lives. She depends on her son for transportation\nbecause she cannot afford a car. She used his car to drive to the hearing. She has high blood pressure,\nbut cannot afford to pay for her prescriptions nor can she afford to pay for a divorce.9\nApplicant\u2019s employment provided her with medical insurance. She could not afford to\npurchase the additional coverage for her husband. In the last ten years, her husband\u2019s alcoholism\nrequired more visits to the emergency room and admissions to the hospital for medical treatment.\nSince he had never had medical insurance when he got sick, they charged his bills on joint credit\ncards. They also charged a $3,500 car purchase on one of their credit cards about 12 years ago. Five\nyears ago, she and her husband contacted a counseling service to consolidate their credit debt.\nBecause the debt was her husband\u2019s, the debt consolidation company deducted the monthly payment\nfrom her husband\u2019s pay check. When he again lost his job, the payments ended. She lacked the\nresources to continue with the monthly payment on his debt.10\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is approximately $1,100 a month. She receives no\nsupport from her husband. Her monthly expenses total $996, and include a mortgage of $200, lot rent\n\nApp Ex G (Applicant\u2019s budget); Tr. at 32.\n11\nTr. at 28-29.\n12\nResponse to SOR, supra note 4; Tr. at 32, 33, 41-45.\n13\nApp. Ex B, supra note 6; App Ex C (Letter, dated March 15, 2007); App Ex D (Undated letter); App Ex E\n14\n(Undated letter); App Ex F (Letter, dated March 14, 2007); Tr. at 45-46.\n Department of the Navy v.

She estimates her blood pressure medicine would cost about $80 a\nmonth. She has only one credit card at this time. She lives modestly.11\nThe SOR lists four unpaid and delinquent credit card debts, totaling $25,226. These credit card\ndebts paid her husband\u2019s medical expenses over a number of years. The credit card debts listed in\nallegations 1.a, 1.b and 1.c are more than three years old. The debt listed in allegation 1.d is less than\nthree years old. She has not paid any of this debt, nor has she contacted the creditors to make\narrangements to pay her debts since she and her husband consolidated some of their debts.12\nApplicant completed a SF-85P on August 18, 2004 at the office with a group of co-workers.\nShe did not have her personal financial records with her when she did. She answered \u201cno\u201d to question\n22b, which asked if she \u201cwas now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?\u201d She\nhad no intent to falsify her answer, but simply forgot to list her old debts, which are identified in the\nSOR. At that time, her home situation had deteriorated. Because of his alcoholism and attendant\nillnesses, her husband created problems at home both financially and emotionally. She found herself\noverwhelmed with the problems.13\nApplicant\u2019s team director describes her as hardworking, efficient, extremely competent with\nexcellent team rapport, and a good communicator. Her co-workers and a friend describe her as\ndedicated, dependable, reliable, honest, and caring. Her supervisor at her summer job also describes\nher as reliable, trustworthy, and dedicated. In this job, she has responsibility for preparing bank\ndeposits and counting the money at the end of the business day. She knows that she works with\nsensitive information as a records clerk, but does not understand how someone could access it and\nuse it. The record contains no evidence, reflecting Applicant\u2019s misuse of sensitive information or a\nfailure to follow the rules.14\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n15\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n16\n Id.\n17\n Id.\n18\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n5\nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline. The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation\nto protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly\nin one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other\naspects of life.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information. \nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\n16\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the\n17\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n18\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.19\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n20\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n21\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n22\n6\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n21\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n22\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nFinancial Considerations\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) apply to Applicant's case. Applicant has four unpaid, delinquent debts\nfrom her estranged husband\u2019s medical treatment, which are significant. For most of these debts, she\ndid not make an effort to resolve them as she lacks the financial resources to pay these debts.\nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). I cannot apply FC\nMC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (The behavior was isolated)\nbecause her four delinquent debts remain outstanding. She incurred these debts over several years. The\ndebts remained unpaid, therefore they are recent.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation)) applies in part. Applicant\u2019s husband suffers from alcoholism. He\ncould not hold a job for any length of time because of his drinking nor could he obtain medical\ninsurance. As a result, when he needed medical treatment for the effects of his drinking, he and his\nwife paid the bills with credit cards. Her husband is now in a nursing home and has been for at least\n18 months. He does not provide any financial support to her and does not provide any funds to pay\nthese credit card debts, which are for his medical expenses. His failure to provide financial support and\nto obtain medical insurance contributed significantly to her current financial situation, which is the\nresult of financial expenses incurred because of his medical treatment for alcoholism.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) has some applicability.\nApplicant and her husband contacted a credit counseling agency about five years ago. With the\nagency\u2019s help, they consolidated their debts. The repayment money came out of her husband\u2019s pay\ncheck until he lost his job. Because of her limited income, she had no ability to continue with these\nmonthly payments. As a result, the debts remain unpaid.\n\nThe Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or\n23\notherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). In ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999), the Appeal Board\nspecifically addressed application of the statute of limitations, stating a \u201cperson who decides not to honor his or her debts\nmay be able to avoid paying those debts until they are legally uncollectible because the statute of limitations has run.\nReliance on the running of a statute of limitations would be a legally permissible course of action. However, it would\nnot demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve one\u2019s debts that would fall under the meaning of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 03-10880 (App. Bd. June 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 (App. Bd.\nMar. 27, 2003) (stating an applicant must do more than merely cite the statute of limitations to obtain the full benefit of\nFC MC 6). See also ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003) (\u201c[E]ven if a delinquent debt is legally\nunenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding\nan applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 98-0349 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 3, 1999) (even though an applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were not legally collectible because of the statute\nof limitations, that fact did not preclude the Administrative Judge from considering the applicant\u2019s failure to resolve the\ndelinquent debts before the statute of limitations ran). Cf. ISCR Case No. 01-04425 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 17, 2002)\n(adverse Guideline F conclusions possible where applicant chose not to pay her delinquent debts, waited until her\ncreditors ceased trying to collect those delinquent debts, and they were eventually dropped from her credit report.).\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n24\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\nFC MC E2.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) does not apply. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the\nfinancial considerations concern or evidence of a good faith effort to repay debt. Although Applicant\nhas indicted that she will pay these debts when she is financially able, she is unlikely to be able to pay\nher debts anytime in the future. She has not contacted any of the creditors to resolve her debts.23\nShe does, however, receive some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the application\nof the 3-year State statute of limitations, which applies to allegations 1.a, 1.b and 1.c of the SOR debts.\nSee State Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530.  The Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial\n24\nvalue of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n25\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\nElimination of 75% of her delinquent debt load through the statute of limitations has ended her\npotential vulnerability to improper financial inducements to pay these debts because she is no longer\n\u201cfinancially overextended,\u201d but it does not negate her past conduct in not paying her outstanding debts.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the\ncentral question does a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified and/or sensitive information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a\nsecurity clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern. It is deliberate if it is done\nknowingly and willfully.\nUnder Guideline E, the government established that Applicant omitted material facts from her\nSF-85P when she answered question 22b. She denies, however, that she deliberately falsified her\nanswer to this question, stating that she forgot about her debts when she completed the form. When\na falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an\nomission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the\nomission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at\nthe time the omission occurred.  For Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC)\n25\nE2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire . . . .) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s\nomission, concealment or falsification in her answer was deliberate. Applicant credibly testified that\nshe forgot about the unpaid debts because of her emotional stress from her problems at home and her\nhusband\u2019s drinking. In addition, her testimony that she did not have her personal records with her when\nshe completed her SF-85P is reasonable, given that her employer required her to complete the form\nin an afternoon at the workplace. Thus, Applicant did not deliberately falsify her trustworthiness\napplication. The government has not established its case under Guideline E.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\n\n9\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant's\ntrustworthiness. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial\nobligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raises serious trustworthiness concerns.\nHowever, her debts arose not because she did not work or over spent her income on frivolous items,\nbut because her income is relatively modest, even with two jobs, and insufficient to meet unexpected\nbills. Her estranged husband is an alcoholic who, as his disease progressed, could not hold steady\nemployment. He had no medical insurance because he did not work, and she could not afford to carry\nhim as a dependant on her insurance. His drinking lead to more medical treatment and bills. They paid\nthese bills with credit cards because they did not have ready cash to pay the bills. Although they are\nstill legally married, her husband no longer lives with her and does not provide her with any financial\nsupport. She lives modestly and not beyond her monthly income. She has no car and must rely on her\nson for transportation. She has forgone her blood pressure medicine, because she cannot afford to pay\nfor it. She has only one credit card, which she regularly pays.\nBecause much of her debt has been eliminated through the statute of limitations, her potential\nvulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is \u201cfinancially overextended\u201d no longer\nexists. She did not ignore her debts and wait for them to expire under a statute of limitations. Rather,\nshe could not pay the debts created by her estranged husband\u2019s conduct because she had no money.\nHer present income does not provide her with extra money to pay her estranged husband\u2019s medical\nbills, which are the basis of her old debts. She does have enough money to meet her current basic\nliving expenses. In recent years, she has not incurred excessive unpaid debt and does not spend her\nmoney unwisely. \nApplicant performs her duties well and is respected by her co-workers and supervisors for her\nwork ethic and integrity. I have weighed the mitigating factors, her current spending habits and\nincome, and her failure to list her debts in her trustworthiness application against the likelihood that\nshe would compromise sensitive information. I find that the overwhelming weight of the evidence\nindicates that she is a person of integrity, who is trustworthy. Despite her constant financial struggle,\nshe has not and would not act in a manner which would harm her employer or the government. There\nis little likelihood she would violate these privacy rights because of her existing debt problems. I\nconclude she has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations. The\npersonal conduct concern is not substantiated. I conclude that she is eligible for a trustworthiness\ndetermination.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-d:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nOn December 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 14, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on March 3, \n2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 14, 2008, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on April 9, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, \nMay 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf but did not \nsubmit any documentary evidence. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record \nopen until April 23, 2008, to submit additional matters. Applicant submitted a fax cover \nsheet and two letters, which were marked AE A through C, and received without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is Hearing Exhibit (HE) XVII. The record closed \non April 23, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 18, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Taiwan and Hong Kong. Applicant did not object. The request \nand the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the \nrecord as HE I through XVI. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He was born in \nChina. When he was very young, his parents and older siblings escaped to Taiwan. \nApplicant and his younger sibling remained in China with other relatives. He and his \nsibling went to live in Taiwan with his parents some years later. After he graduated \ncollege and completed his mandatory military service, he left Taiwan and came to the \nUnited States to attend graduate school. He obtained a Master of Science degree in \ncomputer engineering and a Ph.D. in computer science from an American university. He \nremained and became a U.S. citizen in 1981.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Taiwan. They have been married for more than 30 \nyears. She also became a U.S. citizen in 1981. They have two adult children, both born \nin the U.S. His wife\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. He works in production \nin the media. His wife (Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law) does not work. His daughter \n(Applicant\u2019s niece) is a Taiwanese citizen currently living with Applicant and his wife \nwhile she attends college.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother lives in the United States and is a U.S. citizen. His father was \na U.S. citizen. He is deceased. Applicant has five siblings. Four are U.S. citizens and \nresidents. He has a sister that is a citizen of the United Kingdom and a resident of Hong \nKong. She moved to Hong Kong years before it reverted to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) in 1997. Because she was born in China, the PRC considers her a citizen \nof the PRC. Her husband is also a Hong Kong resident. Applicant believes his brother-\nin-law has the same citizenship status as his sister, but he is not certain. They used to \nown and operate a small company that did business on the Chinese mainland. They no \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 47-50, 83; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 50, 61-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nlonger own the business and she does not currently work. He teaches at a college. \nApplicant would occasionally see his sister during his trips to the PRC, but he has not \nseen her in several years.3  \n \n \nApplicant worked from 1996 to 2003, for a company that did business in Taiwan \nand the PRC. He made numerous business trips to both Taiwan and the PRC between \n1997 and 2002, as part of his employment. His last trip to the PRC was a pleasure trip \nin 2002. He has not visited Taiwan since a pleasure trip in 2005. Applicant became \nfriendly with and maintained sporadic contact with two employees from his former \ncompany that live in Taiwan. He saw one during a business trip to Taiwan in 2001. He \nvisited the other acquaintance while he was in Taiwan in 2005. He has not had contact \nwith either individual in more than a year.4  \n \n \nThe previous company he worked for was going out of business and Applicant \nwas in need of employment. A friend of his mentioned an opportunity in the PRC. He \nintroduced Applicant over the phone to the owner of a start-up company in China. The \nowner paid for Applicant\u2019s flight to China, his hotel, and expenses to meet with Applicant \nand possibly hire him as a consultant. The company was looking to get into a technical \nfield. The owner of the company told Applicant that the Chinese Army was very \ninterested in their work. Applicant told the owner that there was a company in Taiwan \nthat already was doing what they were looking at. He looked at their design and told \nthem that he thought they had the right approach. Applicant decided not to seek \nemployment or consulting work with the company. He did not want to work for a \ncompany that provided goods or services to the Chinese Army. Applicant did not report \nthe reimbursement for expenses on the trip as income on the federal tax return he filed \nthe next year. He did not believe that he was required to report the money because it \njust covered his expenses.5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on June 2, 2004. In \nhis SF 86, Applicant listed all his trips to Taiwan and China. He was interviewed for his \nbackground investigation in about March or April 2006. A written statement was \napparently not taken by the investigator. The investigator did not testify as a witness. If \na Report of Investigation (ROI) containing a summarization of the interview was \ncompleted, it was not offered into evidence. Applicant admitted he told the investigator \nabout his trips to China but he did not go into details about the trip wherein he \ndiscussed working as a consultant. Applicant was interviewed again on October 25, \n2007, and a written statement was provided. The consulting trip to the PRC was fully \ndiscussed in the statement.6 He admitted in the statement: \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 50-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 65-68, 83-84; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 27-32; 64-73; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 73-83; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n\n \n4 \n \nI acknowledged that I deliberately did not mention this information during \nmy earlier interview because I was afraid or concerned that by me \nmentioning it, it would cause additional questions to be asked or scrutiny.7 \n \n \nApplicant testified that the second interview and statement took all day, but the first \ninterview was much shorter, only about two hours. He stated he did not go into detail \nabout the trip because the interview was very short. Applicant admitted that he \ndiscussed specifics about other trips. He further admitted that he told the investigator in \n2006, that during the business trip in question he met other potential customers, \nattended training at their office, and did not recall the names of the customers. I \nspecifically asked Applicant twice to ensure he understood, the question, \u201cWas it your \nintention to let the agent believe that this was just another business trip for your \ncompany?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cYes.\u201d8 I find that Applicant intentionally provided false, \nmisleading, and incomplete answers to the background investigator in March or April \n2006, when asked about the trip in question to the PRC. \n \n \nApplicant has no foreign assets. He has well over $1,000,000 in real estate and \nother assets in the U.S. Character letters from Applicant\u2019s supervisor and program \nmanager attest that he is a trusted and highly regarded engineer. They state he is a \ngenuinely nice person; a person of ability, integrity, persistence, and dedication; \nsomeone who is consistently honest, straight forward, professional, and trustworthy.9 \n \nTaiwan  \n \n \nIn 1949, Taiwan was populated by refugees fleeing a civil war in China. That \nsame year, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nand a separate, independent government was established in Taiwan. The PRC does \nnot recognize Taiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s large military \nestablishment\u2019s primary mission is the defense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is \nseen as the predominant threat and which has not renounced the use of force against \nTaiwan. The PRC maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan. Taiwan is known to be \nan active collector of U.S. economic intelligence. \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy. Through nearly five decades of hard work \nand sound economic management, Taiwan has transformed itself from an \nunderdeveloped, agricultural island to an economic power that is a leading producer of \nhigh-technology goods. On January 1, 1979, the United States formally recognized the \nPRC as the sole legal government of China. The U.S. also announced that it would \nmaintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. \nThe Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) signed into law on April 10, 1979, created the legal \n                                                          \n \n7 GE 2 at 9. \n \n8 Tr. at 73-83; GE 1, 2. \n \n9 Tr. at 85-86; GE 1, 2; AE A-C. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nauthority for the conduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan. The American Institute in \nTaiwan, a private nonprofit corporation with offices in Taiwan, is authorized to issue \nvisas, accept passport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in Taiwan. A \ncounterpart organization was established by Taiwan. It has multiple offices in the U.S. \n \n \nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. \ndoes not support Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s membership in \nappropriate international organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nwhich it joined in 2002, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the \nAsian Development Bank. In addition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for \nTaiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in organizations where its membership is not possible. \n \n \nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its defensive \ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell appropriate defensive military equipment to \nTaiwan, in accordance with the TRA. President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the \nUnited States would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help Taiwan\u2019s defense and approved a \nsubstantial sale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, including destroyers, anti-submarine \naircraft, and diesel submarines. The White House also was more accommodating to \nvisits from Taiwan\u2019s officials than previous U.S. Administrations, and permitted visits \nfrom Taiwan\u2019s president in 2001 and 2003, and Taiwan\u2019s vice president and defense \nminister in 2002. \n \n \nSince then, there have been changes in U.S.-Taiwan relations. Taiwan\u2019s new \npresident disavowed key concepts long embraced by the opposing party - the \u201cstatus \nquo\u201d that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it - and instead has adopted the \nmore provocative position that Taiwan already \u201cis an independent, sovereign country,\u201d a \n\u201cstatus quo\u201d he promises to maintain. There was also a series of recent corruption \nscandals. \n \n \nIn response to Taiwan\u2019s political developments, the Administration appears to \nhave dialed back its earlier enthusiasm for supporting Taiwan\u2019s initiatives. While still \npursuing a close relationship with Taiwan, U.S. officials now appear to be balancing \ncriticisms of the PRC military buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and \nwarnings to the effect that U.S. support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.  \n \nHong Kong \n \nHong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region of the PRC since July 1, \n1997, ending more than 150 years of British colonial rule. Hong Kong has a high degree \nof autonomy, except in the areas of defense and foreign policy, which are the \nresponsibility of the PRC. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is headed by a \nChief Executive voted on by an Election Committee made up of approximately 800 \nHong Kong residents from four constituency groups, including the PRC\u2019s National \nPeople\u2019s Congress. Under Chinese nationality law, persons of Chinese descent who \nwere born on the Chinese mainland or Hong Kong are considered citizens of the PRC. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over \na billion people and an economy growing at about 10% per year. The PRC has an \nauthoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The PRC has a \npoor record with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and its practices \ninclude arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of \nprisoners. The PRC is one of the most aggressive countries in targeting sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology, and economic intelligence. It has targeted the U.S. with \nactive intelligence gathering programs, both legal and illegal. The PRC also maintains \nintelligence operations in Hong Kong. \n \nWhile Hong Kong remains a free and open society where human rights are \nrespected, courts are independent, and there is a well-established respect for the rule of \nlaw, concerns include limitations on residents\u2019 ability to change their government, the \nlegislature\u2019s limited power to affect government policies, self-censorship, violence and \ndiscrimination against women, and restrictions on worker\u2019s rights to organize and \nbargain collectively. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister and brother-in-law are residents of Hong Kong. She is a citizen \nof the United Kingdom. Her husband may also be a U.K. citizen. They are also \nconsidered to be Chinese citizens. The PRC has an authoritarian government, \ndominated by the Communist Party, with a poor human rights record, and targets the \nU.S. for espionage. His wife\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Taiwan, a country \nknown to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence. Applicant\u2019s niece is a \nTaiwanese citizen and lives with him in the United States while she attends college. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign connections create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. They also create a potential conflict of \ninterest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b) and (d) have been raised by the evidence. \n \nI do not find that Applicant\u2019s limited contact with two acquaintances in Taiwan is \nsufficient to raise a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are concluded for \nApplicant.  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s routine business trips \nand personal trips to PRC and Taiwan made him vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or \ncoercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country. The consulting trip he \nmade to the PRC in which he discussed employment by a company that could do \nbusiness with the Chinese Army may have made him vulnerable. Clearly Applicant was \nconcerned enough about what happened on the trip that he chose to mislead the \nbackground investigator about the trip. That specific trip raises security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7(i). His other trips, while relevant evidence, do not raise a disqualifying condition. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is concluded for Applicant.   \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n\n \n9 \n \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant has been in this country for more than 30 years and has been a U.S. \ncitizen for almost three decades. His wife is a U.S. citizen and his two adult children \nwere both born in the U.S. His mother and four of his five siblings are U.S. citizens and \nresidents. He has no foreign assets and substantial U.S. assets. If Applicant had been \ncompletely forthcoming about his consulting trip to the PRC, I would have found that he \nhad such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States that he \ncould be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest, and I \nwould have therefore found AG \u00b6 8(b) applicable. However, without his complete and \ntotal candor to investigators about foreign events, I am unable to make that affirmative \nfinding. No mitigating condition is fully applicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n\n \n10 \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false, misleading, and incomplete answers to a \nbackground investigator. AG 16(b) and (e) have been established.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant did not declare on his income tax return the \nmoney he received in payment during the business trip he took to the PRC. The \nGovernment has not established: (1) that Applicant received money in excess of his \nexpenses; (2) that he was required to report the money received on the trip; (3) that \nApplicant intentionally failed to list the money on the return to avoid paying taxes. There \nis insufficient evidence to find Applicant committed personal conduct that would support \na disqualifying condition for this allegation. SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant.  \n\n \n11 \n \nConditions that could mitigate Personal Conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \nApplicant was less than totally forthcoming about his consulting trip to the PRC \nwhen he was interviewed for his background investigation in March or April 2006. He \ndid not correct the situation before being confronted. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not applicable. When \nspecifically questioned by the background investigator in 2007, he provided the full \ndetails of the trip in a written statement. This has lessened his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) is applicable. No other mitigating \ncondition is fully applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n12 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister and her husband live in Hong Kong and are considered by the \nPRC to be citizens of the PRC. His wife\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. \nHer niece is a Taiwanese citizen and lives with Applicant and his wife while she is \nattending college. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Hong Kong and \nTaiwan. Hong Kong is no longer a British colony. Hong Kong remains a free and open \nsociety where human rights are generally respected. It has some autonomy but is \nclosely connected to the PRC. The PRC has an authoritarian government, a bad human \nrights record, and has a very aggressive espionage program aimed at the U.S. \n \nTaiwan is an ally of the United States. However, Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified [or sensitive] information from any person, \norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of \nwhether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.\u201d10 The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be \nmade with caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly.  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. \n \n \nApplicant has extensive U.S. ties and connections. He and his wife have been \nU.S. citizens for many years. Their two adult children were born in the U.S. His mother \nand four of his siblings are U.S. citizens. He has no foreign assets and substantial real \nestate and other assets in the U.S. He is a well respected, highly regarded engineer. \nBut for the concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, I would have found that he \nmitigated the concerns raised by his foreign connections.

May 19, 2004). \n\n \n13 \n \nhonest to the background investigator about his trip to the PRC, his judgment and \ntrustworthiness is in question and his vulnerability to foreign pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress remains a concern.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nBetween 1987 and 2005, Applicant was convicted three times for Driving Under \nthe Influence and once for public intoxication. Following his 2003 arrest, Applicant \nreceived counseling and stopped drinking. However, he drank again in May 2005, which \nresulted in the public intoxication conviction. With this arrest it was clear to Applicant \nthat he should never again drink. He has not drunk alcohol since 2005.  \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and evidence, I \nconclude Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline G, alcohol consumption. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \n \n \n \n1\nMay 19, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                          \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on October 28, 2007, detailing security concerns under \ncriminal conduct and alcohol consumption.  \n  \n \nOn November 16, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On January 16, 2008, I was assigned the case. On \nMarch 12, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on \nMarch 26, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was kept open \nto allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On March 26, 2008, two additional \ndocuments were received. There being no objection, the documents were admitted into \nevidence as Exs. A and B. On April 10, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1 \nand neither admitted nor denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2, which relate to SOR \u00b6 1, \nallegations which he admitted. In 1987, 1995, and 2003, Applicant was arrested and \nconvicted for Driving Under the Influence of alcohol (DUI). \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old lead technician who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since June 2003, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 41-42) \nApplicant worked for the same company for a couple of years before leaving and then \nreturning. (Tr. 24)  \n \n \nApplicant grew up in the mid-West. Applicant began drinking in 1987 at age 19. \nAlso in 1987, his parents divorced, which occurred when he was away at school. His \nparents sold their house and moved while he was away at school. (Tr. 83) His mother \nand sister moved to California and his father stayed in the mid-West. (Tr. 27, 39) \nFollowing the divorce, Applicant was a bitter person who getting along with was difficult.  \n \nIn May 1987, Applicant, then age 20, was arrested for DUI. (Tr. 71) He had been \nat a bar drinking with friends. (Tr. 68) He spent the weekend in jail. Following his \nconviction for DUI, Applicant was sentenced to 30 days in jail, a $310 fine, and he \nreceived six months probation.  \n \n \nIn February 1994, Applicant obtained his associate\u2019s degree in electronics and \nreceived training in computer technologies. (Tr. 23, 30) He was working as an electronic \ntechnician in California. In 1998, he returned to the mid-West. (Tr. 33) In 1999, he \nmoved to California to start his own business. (Tr. 33) The business was underfinanced \nand folded. (Tr. 28, 38) Applicant moved back to the mid-West. (Tr. 34) In June 2001 \nfollowing a few months of unemployment, he moved to California and attended school. \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\nApplicant received additional computer and network certifications. (Tr. 31) In June 2003, \nhe moved back to the mid-West and started working for his current employer. (Tr. 34) \n \nNew Year\u2019s Eve 1995, Applicant was arrested for speeding and DUI. Following \nconviction for DUI, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 30 days, he paid a $500 fine, \nattended an alcohol awareness class and victim impact education, and was in a \ndiversion program from six to twelve months. (Ex. 3, Tr. 65) In October 2000, he got his \nvehicle stuck following a rain. The police officer smelled alcohol and charged him with \nDUI. He was found not guilty of the charge. \n \nIn 2001, he was arrested and charged with DUI and refusing to submit to a \npreliminary breathalyzer test (PBT). The DUI charge was dismissed, but his driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for one year having been found guilty of refusing to submit to a \nPBT. Applicant attended 90 days recovery treatment. (Ex. A) In November 2003, he \nwas charged with DUI and failure to maintain a single lane of traffic. He spent the \nweekend in jail. The failure to maintain a single lane of traffic charge was dismissed but \nhe was found guilty of the DUI. He paid a $500 fine, was required to attend Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings for two months, received one year probation, and his driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for a year. (Tr. 54) When his license was reinstated, Applicant \nwas required to put a breath analyzer device in his car for an additional year. (Tr. 60) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is in the chronic stages of alcohol dependency and is in the \nprocess of needing emergency acute care. (Ex. A) Applicant is at risk for biological \ndependence due to his father\u2019s chronic stage of alcoholism. (Ex. A) Applicant has \nwatched his father, who is a heavy alcoholic, deteriorate and disintegrate. This has \nincreased Applicant\u2019s motivation to quit drinking. (Tr. 108-109) \n \nFrom late 2003 until the summer of 2004, Applicant attended intensive weekly \ncounseling with a certified alcohol drug abuse counselor. (Ex. A, Tr. 54) It was \ndetermined he was not chemically dependant on alcohol. He was diagnosed with \n\u201cnondependent alcohol abuse unspecified drinking behavior.\u201d (Ex. A, page 3, Tr. 56) \nDuring treatment, he took a hard look at this background and family issues and why \nthings were happening to him. (Tr. 54) The counseling looked at his childhood, family \nissues, and his parent\u2019s problems. Applicant came to realize he was harboring \nresentment against his parents for their divorce. (Tr. 82) He realized he had to accept \nthings and move on. He chose to no longer blame himself and realized there were \nevents and things he had no control over and for which he was not responsible. (Tr. \n107) Following treatment, he describes himself as more honest, open minded, and \nhaving learned to live with facts as they are. (Tr. 108) He is physically in better shape. \n \n \nIn treatment, he was exceptionally motivated, wanted to do well, believed he had \na problem and was willing to put forth the effort to change. He did not blame others for \nhis problems. In May 2004, at the conclusion of treatment, Applicant continued to show \nimprovement and a willingness to maintain abstinence. He was remorseful over his \nconduct. In treatment he came to believe \u201che can not drink without consequences.\u201d (Ex. \nA) Applicant made a decision to never again drive after having anything to drink. (Tr. 61) \n \n\n \n \n \n4\n \nAfter completing counseling, Applicant stopped drinking. (Tr. 77) The next time \nhe drank was in May 2005, when he was out with friends at a bar. When he left the bar, \nhe tripped over a parking stop and was arrested for public intoxication. Applicant was in \ntotal disbelief because he was shocked by his ill fortune in that the one night he drank \nhe was arrested. (Tr. 109) This was the last time Applicant drank alcohol. (Tr. 45) He \nwas found guilty of public intoxication and sentenced to five days in jail (suspended), \nfined $75 and he paid $55 in court costs. (Tr. 48-49) It was a clear sign to him that he \nshould not drink again. (Tr. 77-78) \n \nApplicant has dissociated himself from the friends who consumed alcohol with \nhim. (Tr. 75) He last saw them in 2005. His friends did not take it well when he \nexplained he could no longer associate with them. (Tr. 75) He told them he could not \nafford to get into any more trouble and it was easier if he was with them when they were \ndrinking. His own abstinence was easier if he did not go out with them. (Tr. 75)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family is his support system. They see him as a different person now \nthat he has stopped drinking. (Tr. 82) He now spends time with friends who do not drink. \n(Tr. 76) He spends his time snow skiing, biking, traveling, going to movies, working on \ncars, and going to car shows. He decided to stop drinking because whenever he drank \ntrouble followed him. He understands nothing good happens when he drinks and he \nbelieves it is better to abstain from drinking. (Ex. A, Tr. 74)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n \n \n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying. AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses,\u201c and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d apply. \nBetween 1987 and May 2005, Applicant was arrested a number of times, convicted \nthree times of DUI, and once for public intoxication.  \n \n \nApplicant has a serious drinking problem, which is in remission. Although not \nchemically dependent on alcohol, he was diagnosed with nondependent alcohol abuse. \nIn 1987, at age 20, Applicant was first arrested and convicted of DUI. He was also \narrested and convicted of DUI in 1995 and November 2003. In May 2005 he was \nconvicted of public intoxication. \n \nFollowing his November 2003 arrest, Applicant attended seven months of \nintensive counseling. During treatment, he was exceptionally motivated, believed he \nhad an alcohol problem, and was willing to put forth the effort to change. Applicant \nrealizes there are events, people, and things over which he had no control or \nresponsibility. In treatment he came to believe \u201che can not drink without consequences.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n6\nHis father\u2019s problem with alcohol was a motivating factor. He recognized that alcohol \nhad devastated his father, and he did not want to suffer the same fate.  \n \nAfter completing counseling, Applicant stopped drinking. The next time he drank, \nhe was again arrested. Applicant was in shock and disbelief for the one night that he \nchose to drink he was arrest for public intoxication. This was the last time Applicant \ndrank alcohol. He has dissociated himself from his drinking buddies. He last saw them \nin 2005.  \n \nNot all of his arrests resulted in convictions. AG \u00b6 32(c) \u201cevidence that the person \ndid not commit the offense,\u201d applies to those incidents.  \n \nIt has been three years since his last arrest. Applicant has a good employment \nrecord, has expressed remorse, has changed his friends, and no longer goes to the city \nwhere the majority of his arrests occurred. AG \u00b6 32(a) \u201cso much time has elapsed since \nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies as does AG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption, \n\u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d Applicant was arrested and convicted four times for alcohol \nrelated incidents. AG \u00b6 22(a) Aalcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \ncriminal incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,@ and AG \u00b6 22(c) \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d apply. \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with nondependent alcohol abuse by a certified alcohol \ndrug abuse counselor. The record does not contain the exact nature of Applicant\u2019s \ncounseling, nor is it established the counseling was part of an \u201calcohol rehabilitation \nprogram.\u201d Therefore, even though a certified alcohol drug abuse counselor made the \nevaluation and Applicant relapsed following his counseling, AG \u00b6 22(e) \u201cevaluation of \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(f) \u201crelapse after \ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation \nprogram, \u201cdo not apply. The counselor does not meet the criteria of a licensed clinical \nsocial worker under AG \u00b6 22(e) and is not a medical professional under AG \u00b6 22(d). \n \n\n \n \n \n7\n \nAG \u00b6 22(b) \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser),\u201d applies. His counseling was an action to overcome his problem. \nStarting in 2003, Applicant sought counseling, was exceptionally motivated, believed he \nhad a problem and was will to put forth the effort to change. Even though abstinence is \nrequired only for those alcohol dependent, Applicant has established a pattern of \nabstinence. In the four and a half years his November 2003 arrest, Applicant has \nrefrained from drinking except for a single night. It has been three years since his last \ndrink. He is committed to maintaining abstinence. He has changed his friends.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an alcohol abuser. \nDuring the seventeen year period between 1987 and May 2005, he was arrested eight \ntimes. Following his November 2003 DUI arrest, Applicant stopped drinking. However, it \nwas his one day return to drinking that resulted in his most recent arrest in 2005 and \nreinforced his belief he should not drink again. He no longer associates with his drinking \nfriends. He spends time with people who do not drink. He no longer frequents the city \nwere the majority of arrests occurred. In the vernacular of AA, he has changed has \n\u201cplaymates\u201d and \u201cplaypens.\u201d \n \nApplicant is motivated to refrain from all use of alcohol. He has come to believe \nnothing good happens when he drinks and believes it is better to abstain from drinking. \nHis May 2005 arrest, following a year and a half of abstinence assisted in his motivation \nto stop using as did his father\u2019s problems with alcohol. His father is in the chronic stages \nof alcohol dependency. His father\u2019s deterioration and disintegration has strengthened \nApplicant\u2019s resolve to remain alcohol free.  \n\n \n \n \n8\n \nHis counseling not only addressed his drinking, but also his problems with his \nfamily. The counseling gave him insight into how he was leading his life. Applicant has \nmade permanent behavioral changes. It has been three years since his last drink which \nsupports the likelihood Applicant will remain alcohol free and have no additional adverse \nalcohol incidents.  \n \nEven with his numerous alcohol related arrests during the 17 year period ending \nin May 2003, overall, the record evidence, including his counseling and three year \nabstinence from alcohol, leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant owes seven delinquent or charged off debts totaling approximately $13,000.\nApplicant asserts these debts are being handled through Consumer Credit Counseling Services\n(CCCS), but failed to show payment to CCCS after the first three months.  The record evidence is\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\n1\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n2\ninsufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from Applicant\u2019s\nunpaid debts. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\n1\nclearance for Applicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted\nor continued due to Financial Considerations security concerns.\nOn February 24, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  In his reply,\nApplicant stated \u201cI don\u2019t really want a hearing, but if that is what it takes, I will do it.\u201d On March\n25, 2007, Applicant stated he would like a determination made without a hearing. On April 18, 2007,\na File of Relevant Material (FORM) was submitted by Department Counsel and received by\nApplicant on April 26, 2007.  Applicant was instructed he had 30 days to submit any objections to\nthe information in the FORM or to supply additional information.  The Applicant\u2019s response was\ndue on May 26, 2007.  As of June 27, 2007, nothing had been received from Applicant.  On June\n28, 2007, I was assigned the case.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for Financial Considerations. Applicant admits being\napproximately $13,000 delinquent on seven debts. The admission is incorporated herein as findings\nof fact. After a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 62-year-old security officer who has worked for a defense contractor since\nApril 2002, and is seeking to maintain a secret security clearance.  He has worked at the same\ngovernment agency for 37 years. \nIn 1999, Applicant\u2019s oldest son was killed in an accident.  In 2001, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s illness\nresulted in her unemployment.  Both events contributed to his financial problems. As of September\n2006, Applicant gross income was $1,671 every two weeks and his net pay was $1,113. (Item 8) In\nOctober 2006, Applicant entered into a debt management program with CCCS to address the\n$13,546 owed on the seven debts listed in the SOR.  The plan required Applicant to make proposed\nmonthly payments of $352 to CCCS.  (Item 8) The two medical bills of $75 each (SOR 1.b. and 1.c.)\nwere anticipated to be paid off by May 1, 2007. \nIn February 2007, when Applicant responded to the SOR (Item 3), he attached three\ndocuments from CCCS showing he had made payments of $347 each in December 2006, January\n2007, and February 2007.  On March 25, 2007, when Applicant again responded to the SOR (Item\n4), he included documents from CCCS showing payment in December 2006 and January 2007, but\ndid not include proof of payment for March 2007.  The record contains no additional proof of\npayments to CCCS. \n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n3\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F, Financial Considerations.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Financial Considerations. A\nperson\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating\n\n4\nan inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of strong\nextenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial\ndifficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. Under\nGuideline F, an Applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so\nas to meet his financial obligations. \nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nThe Applicant admits owing seven debts totaling more than $13,000. Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19( c) a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations, apply. \nBecause Applicant did not respond to the File of Relevant Material (FORM) or submit\nadditional information, the decision must be based on the case record.  Applicant has established he\nmade three payments of $347 each to CCCS.  Had the payments continued, it could have established\nhe had initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors and I would have applied mitigating\nCondition (MC) 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.  Had Applicant responded to the FORM and shown payments for March\n2007, April 2007, and May 2007 I would have found it likely he would continue to make his\nmonthly payments.  If an Applicant makes monthly payments for six months it is likely he will\ncontinue making the monthly payments.\nHowever, it is very common that individuals will enter into a payment plan with CCCS and\nmake one, two, or three payments and then stop making payments.  In Applicant\u2019s March 25, 2007\nresponse (Item 6) he failed to show he had made his March 2007 payment, which would have been\ndue by that time.  It may have been an oversight on his part in failing to include proof of his March\n2007 payment, but I cannot assume the payment was made. Given the absence of any documentation\nin the record that corroborated payment after the first three months, I cannot find a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts exists.\nNone of the other mitigating conditions apply in the Applicant\u2019s favor. MC 20(a) the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment does not apply because the debts remain unpaid and the behavior is recent (was not\nso long ago).  Additionally, there are seven debts so the behavior was not infrequent and there is no\nshowing the debts occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur.\nMC 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\ndoes not apply.  There were factors beyond Applicant\u2019s control, i.e., the death of his son in 1999 and\nhis wife\u2019s illness and loss of employment in 2001.  But these events occurred more than six years\nago and Applicant has not paid even the two small debts that were $75 each. \n\n5\nMC 20( c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control does not apply because there\nis no evidence of counseling or that the problem is under control. Had Applicant established\ncontinued payments, I could have found the problem was being resolved.  MC20(e) the individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue, does not apply because Applicant admits owing the debts.  MC 20(f)\nthe affluence resulted from a legal source of income, does not apply because affluence is not at\nissue.\nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence in the future.  Because Applicant has failed to document payment of his debts beyond\nthe first three months, I find against Applicant on financial considerations.\nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that the Applicant cannot or will\nnot attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security\nclearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based\non applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under the\nApplicant\u2019s current circumstances a clearance is not recommended, but should the Applicant be\nafforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, having paid his debts or\nestablished compliance with a repayment plan, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his\nsecurity worthiness. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\n  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\n  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\n  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\n  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\n  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\n  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\n  Against Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n\n6\n_____________________________\nClaude R.

Since incurring the debts that precipitated the bankruptcy, she\nhas obtained a steady, well-paying job that has enabled her to make payments toward the satisfaction\nof her outstanding delinquencies through a Chapter 13 payment plan without interruption for the past\n18 months, while comfortably managing her other monthly expenses. She has mitigated the security\nconcern. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  Applicant answered it on December 12,\n1\n2006, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 10, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 27, 2007, scheduling it for March 13, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled. During the\nhearing, I received five government exhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two\nApplicant witnesses. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open through March 27, 2007\nfor Applicant to submit additional exhibits. That day, she submitted five additional exhibits.\nDepartment Counsel did not object to their admissibility. I then marked them as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nI through M, and incorporated them into the record. DOHA received the transcript on March 23,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old married woman with two children, ages 15 and 4. She has a high\nschool diploma. For the past three years, she has worked as a process inspection operator. Her duties\ninclude, among other things, quality control, and employee training. She is an exemplary employee\nwho is highly respected by her coworkers.2\nIn early 2000, Applicant\u2019s quit her full-time job and took a part-time job in order to care for\nher ailing mother.  Although she obtained another full-time job a few months later, she only made\n3\n\nId.\n4\nTr. 73.\n5\nTr. 75-76.\n6\nSee generally,, Summary of Schedules, dated February 9, 2001, as included in Exhibit M, Bankruptcy Records,\n7\nat 14.The amount discharged is the difference between the total liabilities, as listed at the bottom of the summary of\nschedules, and the amount of her mortgage and car note, both of which she re-affirmed.\nExhibit M at 3; Security Clearance Application, dated July 29, 2005.\n8\nTr. 79-80.\n9\nTr. 89.\n10\nExhibit A, Interim Statement as of September 23, 2006, at 1.\n11\nId.; Exhibit K, Interim Statement as of March 15, 2007, at 1.\n12\n3\nhalf the income than she earned at her previous full-time job.  At or about the time she obtained the\n4\nnew job, her husband was severely burned in a household accident, rendering him unable to work\nfor six months.5\nSubsequently, Applicant and her husband grew delinquent on their debts. They met with a\nfinancial counselor who advised them to consider filing for bankruptcy.  On or about February 15,\n6\n2001, they filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On May 22, 2001, they obtained a discharge of\napproximately $42,100 of delinquent debt,  including the one listed in subparagraph 1.c.\n7\n8\nApplicant\u2019s husband returned to work approximately one month before filing for bankruptcy.\nIn late 2001, he injured himself on the job. For the next three years, the injury severely limited his\nwage-earning capacity, because he could no longer perform his previous job duties.  Although\n9\nApplicant during this period had begun working a full-time job in addition to the part-time job she\nhad taken when her mother grew ill, she was still making less than she did before quitting h the job\nshe held in 1999.10\nApplicant and her husband again accrued significant financial delinquencies. In 2003,\nApplicant\u2019s husband received a $65,000  worker\u2019s compensation settlement. He spent approximately\n$25,000 of the settlement on the purchase of a recreational vehicle and an automobile. Applicant\nspent the remainder of the settlement money primarily on routine expenses. Because her husband\nremained unable to find full-time work throughout the rest of the year, they were unable to make\nsignificant progress toward the satisfaction of their delinquent debt.\nOn approximately June 17, 2005, Applicant and her husband filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nprotection. Approximately $16,000 of debt is included in the court-ordered payment plan, including\nthe debts listed in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.   For the past 18 months, they have been paying the\n11\ntrustee $30 per week. They have not missed any payments, and are on schedule to satisfy the\ndelinquencies over the next 33 months.12\n\nExhibit 5, Credit Bureau Report, dated November 14, 2006.\n13\nCompare Applicant\u2019s 2004 IRS Form W-2 with her 2005 IRS Form W-2, at pages 14-15 of Exhibit L.\n14\nExhibit 3, Personal Financial Statement, signed November 10, 2005.\n15\nTr. 29; see also Exhibit 2, SF-86 electronically submitted February 2, 2004.\n16\nTr. 31-38.\n17\nTr. 32.\n18\nTr. 49.\n19\n4\nApplicant has stayed current on all of her other debts, including two home mortgages, while\nmaking her Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments.  Between 2004 and 2005, Applicant\u2019s income nearly\n13\ndoubled.  During that time, her husband was successfully able to obtain a full-time job. Currently,\n14\nshe has approximately $232 of income remaining after all monthly expenses have been paid.15\nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86) in July 2005. In response to\nQuestion 33 (Your Financial Record - Bankruptcy - In the last 7 years, have you filed a petition\nunder any chapter of the bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?), she listed the 2001 bankruptcy,\nbut not the 2005 bankruptcy. According to the facility security officer (FSO) at Applicant\u2019s company,\nshe originally completed an SF 86 in February 2004, and submitted it through her employer to\nDefense Security Services (DSS), the agency handling the security clearance investigative function\nat the time.  DSS never opened an investigation before their investigative function was transferred\n16\nto the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When OPM assumed the function, it requested\nthe management at Applicant\u2019s company to resubmit any security clearance applications that had\nbeen pending immediately before the transfer. It was unclear whether they wanted the employees to\nupdate the information.  The FSO at the time, returned the applications to Applicant and the other\n17\nemployees similarly situated, instructed them to sign them again, but did not instruct them to update\nany information.18\nApplicant\u2019s second bankruptcy occurred after she submitted the first SF 86. Consistent with\ninstructions from management, she re-signed the copy of the SF-86 submitted the previous year, and\ndid not update it.19\nApplicant also did not list any of the SOR debts in response to Question 38 (Your Financial\nDelinquencies - 180 Days - In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt?), and Question 39 (Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 days - Are you currently over 90 days\npast due on any debt(s)). SOR subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. were included in the Chapter 13\nbankruptcy filed in June 2005. There is no evidence on file that they were 90 or more days\ndelinquent in 2004 when Applicant originally completed the SF 86. SOR subparagraph 1.c. was\ndischarged in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001.\nPOLICIES\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n20\n5\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n20\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant\u2019s recurrent financial difficulties which contributed to the filing of two bankruptcies\nbetween 2001 and 2004, trigger the application of Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition\n(FC DC) a (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC c (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and FC DC e (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio and other financial\nanalysis).\nThe recurrent nature of the financial problems eliminates Financial Consideration Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) a (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur) from consideration. FC MC b (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) is also inapplicable. Specifically, the first\nprong of FC MC b applies, but not the second prong. The financial problems that led to the filing\nof the 2001 bankruptcy primarily were caused when Applicant quit her full-time job, and took a\nlesser-paying, part-time job, to enable her to spend more time caring for her seriously ill mother, and\nthey recurred shortly thereafter, when an on-the-job injury disabled her husband from working full\ntime for approximately three years. Conversely, Applicant and her husband used part of his 2003\nworker\u2019s compensation settlement to buy a recreational vehicle and an automobile, rather than to\nsatisfy outstanding debts.\nApplicant has been paying her creditors through a bankruptcy trustee for the past 18 months\nwithout interruption. Her salary has nearly doubled since 2004, and she has approximately $232 of\nincome remaining after all monthly expenses have been paid. FC MC c (there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC d (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply. \nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s responses to Questions 33, 38, and 39 of her 2005 SF 86 raise the issue of\nwhether Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition a (deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) applies. Applicant completed her first SF 86 in February 2004. The Chapter 13\nbankruptcy occurred in 2005, 16 months later. When the FSO gave her a copy of the 2004 SF 86,\nhe simply asked her to re-sign it, and return it, not update it. The omission of the Chapter 13\nbankruptcy was not intentional.\nThe debts listed in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. were included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nNo evidence indicates that the debts were either 90 days overdue, or had ever been 180 days overdue\nat the time she initially completed the SOR in 2004. Subparagraph 1.c. was discharged in the Chapter\n7 bankruptcy in 2001. PC DC a does not apply. \n\nDirective \u00b6E2.2.1.6.\n21\nDirective \u00b6E2.2.1.8.\n22\n7\nThere are no personal conduct security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s recurrent financial difficulties that precipitated the filing of a second bankruptcy\nin 2005 generate a security concern. These adverse facts are outweighed by the length of time she\nhas earned enough income to comfortably satisfy her monthly expenses, and the extensive period of\ntime she has been in compliance with the Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. Evaluating these facts in the\ncontext of the whole person concept, particularly the presence of rehabilitation,  and the minimal\n21\npotential for coercion,  I conclude she has mitigated the security concern.\n22\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n8\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRay T. Blank Jr. Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant explained and mitigated her history of financial problems based on (1) her good-\nfaith efforts to repay or otherwise resolve her debts, and (2) circumstances largely beyond her control\n(unemployment during 2001\u20132003) that contributed to her financial problems. Eligibility is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) reviewed Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\noccupy an information systems position designated as an ADP I, II, or III position to support a\ncontract with the Defense Department. As a result of the review, the agency recommended\nApplicant\u2019s case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether Applicant is\neligible to occupy such a position. \nActing under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated  January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive), DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on August 25, 2006. The\nSOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis for the action\nand alleges a concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. Under Guideline F, the SOR\nalleges that Applicant has four delinquent debts for more than $15,000.\nApplicant timely replied to the SOR in writing on September 20, 2006. She admitted the\nindebtedness alleged in the SOR, and she elected to have her case decided on the written record in\nlieu of a hearing.  \nOn December 21, 2006, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant\nand material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by her on January 16, 2007. Applicant\u2019s reply\nto the FORM is a 12-page multi-part submission dated February 7, 2007. Department counsel having\nno objections, it is admitted into the record as Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me March 13,\n2007.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact, and I make the following\nfindings of fact.\n1.\nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a company that provides health-care services to the\nDefense Department. She has not married and has no children. Her job involves having access to\nunclassified information (for example, names, personal medical information, etc.). \n2.\nIn conjunction with her employment, Applicant completed a questionnaire for public trust\npositions (Standard Form 85P) in August 2004. In response to Question 22 about her financial\nrecord, she disclosed four credit card accounts that were then over 180-days delinquent. Also, she\nstated that she was unable to make payments due to unemployment. \n\n3\n3.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems, as evidenced by delinquent consumer debts\nreflected in credit reports from 2004 and 2006. Each of the four delinquent debts in the SOR is\ndiscussed below.\n4.\nSOR subparagraph 1.a concerns a charged-off account for $2,816. The 2004 credit report\nshows this bank credit card account was opened in October 1999. The account went into collection\nat some point and was then charged off by the creditor in October 2003. The December 2006 credit\nreport shows a balance of $2,995. This account remains unpaid.\n5.\nSOR subparagraph 1.b concerns a $75 collection account. Applicant presented documentary\nproof that she paid off the account in full in September 2006 (Exhibit A at 4).\n6.\nSOR subparagraph 1.c concerns a $6,877 collection account. The 2004 credit report shows\nthis debt originated as a bank credit card account, it became seriously past due, and it was assigned\nto a firm for collection of a balance of $5,539. The July 2006 credit report shows a balance of\n$6,877, and the December 2006 credit report shows a balance of $7,239. This account remains\nunpaid. \n7.\nSOR subparagraph 1.d concerns a $5,818 collection account. The 2004 credit report shows\nthis bank credit card account was opened in May 2001. The account went into collection at some\npoint and was then charged off by the creditor in the amount of $6,977. The current creditor is a\ncollection agency, and Applicant entered into a payment arrangement in January 2007 (Exhibit A\nat 6). The current balance of the account is $10,450. She has made $600 in payments, and the\npayment plan calls for her to make monthly payments of $50 before the end of each month. If she\ndefaults, the creditor will declare the entire balance due and proceed accordingly. \n8.\nIn addition to the four debts in the SOR, Applicant has resolved two other accounts. In\nFebruary 2007, she paid $156 to resolve a medical bill (Exhibit A at 3). In September 2006, she\nresolved a bank credit card account, although the amount is not reflected in the release-of-debt\ndocument (Exhibit A at 5). The 2004 credit report shows this account was opened in October 2001,\nand it had a balance of $391 when it was charged off. \n9.\nApplicant traces her financial problems to a period of unemployment during 2001\u20132003. In\nher February 2007 reply to the FORM, Applicant explained her unemployment and financial\nsituation as follows:\nI was employed at [company and place] in 2001 when I was laid off in their April\nreduction of personnel. Since that time I was actively seeking employment in the\narea. I had registered with several of the temporary staffing agencies and was sent on\nseveral assignments over the years 2001\u20132004. However I was not continually\nemployed by any of the companies where I worked. I did try to keep up my payments\non the credit cards until I literally had no money in April of 2002. What little I was\nmaking was going to my current living expenses. Several times over these years I was\nhelped to pay my utilities and my rent through the charity of my church and [an\norganization]. I literally had nothing to put against these debts. Once I was employed\nby [the current health-care company] I have been working to get my current living\nexpenses back on a regular payment basis. In February 2002 I began making\n\n ADP Case No. 03-21205, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 289 (App. Bd. Dec. 23, 2005).\n1\n4\npayments to [SOR subparagraph 1.d], which holds the account from [the bank]. I\nhave paid off [SOR subparagraph 1.b] debt in September [2006] and the account [not\nalleged in the SOR] in September [2006]. I am also enrolled to take [a financial\ncourse]. I will be using my tax refunds to pay on the other accounts. \n10.\nApplicant documented her history of unemployment by presenting a letter from a state agency\n(Exhibit A at 7). The letter reports Applicant received unemployment-insurance benefits of $3,160,\n$4,135, and $1,286 (before taxes) for the years of 2001, 2002, and 2003. If she remains employed,\nshe intends to continue to resolve the accounts, little by little. \nPOLICIES\nThis case involves an adjudication of Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP position, not\nan adjudication of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. There is a potential conflict with\nregard to the controlling regulatory authority in these cases. By memorandum, dated November 19,\n2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security directed DOHA\nto utilize Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 to resolve contractor cases forwarded to it for a\ntrustworthiness determination, to include those cases involving ADP I, II, and III positions. I\nunderstand the memorandum to say that ADP cases should be resolved under the Directive\nexclusively. The DOHA Appeal Board, however, has stated that in ADP cases we follow the\nprocedures contained in the Directive, and we apply the adjudicative guidelines contained in\nDepartment of Defense Regulation 5200-2.R, dated January 1987.  I have elected not to resolve this\n1\npotential conflict because the provisions of the Regulation and the Directive under Guideline F are\nsubstantially the same and any differences would not have a material effect on the outcome of the\ncase. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F, a concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also\nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding sensitive\ninformation.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a concern is raised by significant unpaid\ndebts. The evidence shows a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as an inability to\npay debts. The charged-off and collection accounts are ample evidence of Applicant\u2019s derogatory\nfinancial history. As established above, she has paid off one $75 debt and two debts not alleged in\nthe SOR. She has a payment arrangement for one debt, which has a current balance of more than\n$10,000. The other two debts remain unpaid with current balances of $2,995 and $7,239. In total,\nshe owes more than $20,000 for the three debts. These circumstances raise a concern about\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-25499 (Ap. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) (Applicant was not required, as a matter of law, to\n2\nestablish that he had completely paid off his indebtedness).  \n5\nApplicant\u2019s suitability to occupy an information systems position designated as an ADP I, II, or III\nposition. \nI reviewed the mitigating conditions (MC) under the guideline and conclude she receives\ncredit in mitigation. Each MC is summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014the behavior was not recent\u2014does not apply. Although the accounts are\nsomewhat dated, her obligations on these accounts are continuous and ongoing.\nThe second MC\u2014it was an isolated incident\u2014does not apply. The record evidence shows\nseveral unpaid debts, establishing a pattern of Applicant not meeting her financial obligations.    \nThe third MC\u2014the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol\u2014applies in her favor. She was unemployed during 2001-2003, and her unemployment\nresulted in her using credit cards to finance living expenses. Clearly, her unemployment is a\ncircumstance largely beyond her control that had a negative effect on her overall financial situation.\nThe fourth MC\u2014the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u2014does not apply. Although\nshe explained that she had enrolled in a financial course, the evidence does not show that she\ncompleted the course, nor does it show the content of the course. Given these skimpy facts, I cannot\nconclude that she has received or is receiving financial counseling.\nThe fifth MC\u2014the affluence resulted from a legal source\u2014is not applicable here.\nThe sixth MC\u2014the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u2014applies in her favor. To resolve her indebtedness, she has done the\nfollowing: (1) paid three accounts; (2) entered into a payment arrangement with one account; and\n(3) intends to pay off the remaining debts little by little. Taken together, her efforts are sufficient to\nfall within the meaning of good-faith effort.\nI have also considered the record evidence in the context of the whole-person concept.\nApplicant is 55 years old and her financial history includes a substantial period of unemployment\nthat contributed to her financial problems. She now has a decent job with a stable company in the\nhealth-care business. As evidenced by her reply to the FORM, she has made a mature, good-faith\neffort to resolve the accounts in the SOR as well as two accounts not in the SOR. Her intent to\nresolve the remaining unpaid debts is accepted as genuine given her documented efforts to resolve\nher financial problems. \nAfter weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I conclude Applicant has overcome\nthe case against her. She has shown that she is serious about resolving her past financial problems\nand she is making progress. Although she has not presented a perfect case in mitigation by paying\noff all accounts alleged in the SOR,  she has provided sufficient information to explain and mitigate\n2\n\n6\nthe financial considerations concern. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has established that it is in\nthe interests of national security to grant her eligibility for an ADP I, II, or III position.   \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR Paragraph 1\u2013Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I, II, or III position. Eligibility is\ngranted.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT 3 After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: Applicant, 61 years old, has worked for a defense contractor from September 1977 to present as a maintenance supervisor. He completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in August 2005. He previously was granted a Secret clearance. He received a certificate from a vocational technical education school in December 1972. (Exhibit 1) Applicant has served in the military from 1962 to 1966. (Exhibit 1) Applicant stated he has had a clearance since 1977. (Exhibit 3) Applicant married in 1979. He has four children born ages 19, 21, 26 and 27. (Exhibit 1; TR 36, 50-51) He and his wife were divorced in May 2006. (TR 45) She has remarried, so he has no future financial obligations to her. They have no children under 18.

He has borrowed from his 401 (k) and used the proceeds from the\nsale of his house to resolve the majority of his debts; he has developed no new debts.  Significantly,\nhe has demonstrated his outstanding performance and character on the job where he is seen as a\nperson of excellence and integrity.  Overall, he has taken several steps to reform his conduct and\nstated an intent to resolve all his debts; so he  demonstrated sufficient positive changes in behavior\nto mitigate financial concerns.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on November 17, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over\n1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F) in paragraph 1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, to be effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer dated\nDecember 11, 2007.  He requested a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel on March 16, 2007, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The matter\nwas assigned to me on March 19, 2007. Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was\nagreed to; and a Notice of Hearing, issued on March 30, 2007, set the matter for May 17, 2007, at\na location near where Applicant works and lives.\n \nAt the hearing the Government offered seven exhibits  (Exhibit 1-7), which were admitted\ninto evidence. Applicant testified, and called two witnesses.  Applicant offered three documents\n(Exhibits A - C), which were admitted into evidence without objection.  I granted Applicant two\nweeks to submit additional evidence to which the Government consented, and Department Counsel\nhad one week to review it.  (TR 53; 69-70)  Applicant submitted his evidence on May 30, 2007.\n(Exhibit D) Department counsel responded on June 5, 2007, that he had no objection; however,\nhe noted that several of the documented payments of debts did not relate to SOR allegations.  The\ndocument was admitted into evidence and the record closed on June 5, 2007.  The transcript (TR)\nwas received on June 6, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\nApplicant, 61 years old, has worked for a defense contractor from September 1977 to\npresent as a maintenance supervisor. He completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in August  2005.  He previously was\ngranted a Secret clearance. He received a certificate from a vocational technical education school\nin December 1972.  (Exhibit 1)  Applicant has served in the military from 1962 to 1966.  (Exhibit\n1) Applicant stated he has had a clearance since 1977. (Exhibit 3)\nApplicant married in 1979.  He has four children born ages 19, 21, 26 and 27.  (Exhibit 1;\nTR 36, 50-51) He and his wife were divorced in May 2006. (TR 45) She has remarried, so he has\nno future financial obligations to her.  They have no children under 18.  (TR 46)\nFinances\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when he had two children in college, and he started\nfinancing their college expenses and his family expenses with credit cards.  The interest became\nso onerous that he could not keep up even with the interest in 2003. He then got a loan on his\n401(k) to address his financial issues.  (TR 38, 40; 61-62)  He currently has only one child\nfinancially dependent on him. (TR 36) He later explained that this child is now living\nindependently.  (TR 51)\nApplicant explained on his e-QIP that he had several large credit card debts he was unable\nto pay and defaulted. He reported owing $11,199.54 for one credit card, $10,000 for a second\ncredit card, and $3,645 on a third debt. He reported a residential lien of $5,000 placed in July 2003.\nHe had cleared three debts by August 2005 and reported he had four more to pay. His wages were\ngarnished $1,000 for back taxes in July 2001.  He is still making payments on his federal taxes in\n2007.  (Exhibit 1; TR 65-67) At the time of his divorce, he considered filing for bankruptcy but\nchose not to do so. (TR 69)  The current status of these debts is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT (date)\nAMOUNT\nCURRENT STATUS\n1.a.\nCredit Card acquired in\n1985 and charged off.\n(2000)\n$12,248.00\nApplicant stated he paid it\noff in a settlement in August \n2003 by taking a $40,000\nloan on his 401 (k). \n(Answer; Exhibits 3, 4, 6;\nExhibits C, TR 41; 46-49)\n1.b.\nCredit Card charged\noff. (2001)\n$11,199.00\nApplicant stated he and his\nwife split the debt; he paid it\nin September 2006 with\nproceeds from the sale of the\nhouse.  (Answer; Exhibits 3,\n4, 6; Exhibits C, TR 42; 49-\n52)\n\n4\n1.c.\nCollection for a\nfinancial group. (2004)\n$ 10,546.00\nInitially, Applicant stated he\npaid it of in a settlement in\nAugust  2003.  (Answer;\nExhibits 3, 4, 6; Exhibits C,\nTR 41; 54-55-56) He then\ndocumented a settlement\npayment of $7,250 in\nOctober 2006. (Exhibit D)\n1.d. \nCollection for account\nsold to another\ncollection agency.\n(2001)\n$  3,698.00\nUnpaid. He testified that a\nsettlement offer is pending. \nHe hopes to begin payments\nin summer 2007.  (Answer;\nTR 42)  \n1.e.\nCollection for charged\noff account.  (2001)\n$3,645.00\nUnpaid. He planned to use\nthe proceeds of his house to\nsettle this account.  In May\n2007 he was not sure who\nowned this account as it had\nbeen sold to a different\ncollection company.\n(Answer; Exhibit 3; TR 44;\n59-61; 68)  \n1.f.\nCollection for charged\noff account.  (2001)\n$ 6,119.00\nPaid.  The bank obtained a\njudgment and sold the debt\nto a collection agency who\nplaced a lien on the home;\nthe lien was paid when they\nsold the house in September\n2006.  (Answer; Exhibit 3;\nExhibit C;  TR 44-45; 62-\n63)  \nApplicant reported on a Personal Financial Statement in April 2006 that his monthly net\nincome of $3,800 was expended on $1,350 in expenses and $1,673 in debt.  He had assets of\n$110,000 for his home and a 401(k) account worth $135,000.  However, he had borrowed against\nit to make some debt payments.  In order to repay the loan on his 401(k) he makes a $700-800\nmonthly payment.  (Exhibit 2; TR 58-59)  In September 2006 he stated that his \u201cdebt situation has\nstabilized.\u201d  All of the debts stemmed from 2000 to 2004 period; he has not incurred any other\nnon-payment of debts since that period.  (Exhibit 3) His May 2007 budget reflected monthly\nincome of $3,130, expenses of $2,867.22 (including $600 per month average costs for his\ndaughter\u2019s university tuition and $775 for her other living expenses) with $263 remainder.\n(Exhibit A)\nReference\n\n5\nThe site manager has known Applicant since October 1986 and has been his direct\nsupervisor during all of his time at the site.  Applicant exercises technical control over maintenance\nfor three site locations and supervises a staff of six engineers and technicians.  The supervisor\nattested that all of his experiences with Applicant have been positive.  He is directly responsible\nfor initiatives that have saved the military hundreds of thousands of dollars because of his\ndevelopment of techniques which have improved maintenance activities.  Under his leadership,\n\u201chis staff has reached the highest levels of productivity and professionalism.\u201d  He is well respected\nby the military community as a leading expert and has earned the trust and respect of the military\ncustomer, peers and subordinates.  For example he was entrusted to hand-carry extremely fragile\n$700,000 camera components between the vendor and the sites, including international travel.  His\n\u201chonesty, integrity and loyalty have been above reproach.\u201d (Exhibit B)\nThe program manager for the program where Applicant works testified on Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf.  The manager has been in the program for ten years and oversees three sites with sixty\npeople.  Previously he served in the military for 21 years and has a secret clearance or higher\nthroughout his entire 30-year career.  This manager has known him for ten years and attested to\nApplicant\u2019s important and responsible position in overseeing maintenance for a multi-million\ndollar system.  \u201cAnd without his expertise, we would have suffered in terms of our ability to keep\nthe system operational when it was needed to perform.\u201d  He is the only contractor approved to\ncarry expensive replacement cameras internationally.  He serves in a \u201chighly trusted position\ninvolving immense responsibilities and of very important significance to our nation.\u201d  This\nmanager oversees the evaluation process and reported that applicant consistently gets outstanding\nevaluations which are given to only the top people in the program.  He reported Applicant is \u201cup\nthere right at the top.\u201d  He recommended him for a position of trust. (TR 19-26)\nA military officer who is the detachment commander where Applicant works also testified\non Applicant\u2019s behalf.  He does the daily quality assurance evaluations of the contractor and has\nhad a top secret clearance since 2000.  He has daily interactions with Applicant on site operations.\nHe supervises and evaluates his performance for the government and has given him an \u201cexcellent\u201d\nrating, the \u201chighest rating possible.\u201d He testified that Applicant has demonstrated \u201cabsolute\nintegrity on the issues regarding accountability.\u201d  He recommended that Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance be continued.  (TR 28-33)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which  are divided into conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding\nwhether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the administrative\njudge considers the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case and weighs relevant revised\nAdjudication Guidelines: the mere presence or absence of any adjudication policy condition is not\ndecisive. \n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate\n\n     Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n3\n6\npersuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.\nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to\ndo so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall\ncommon sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and\nconclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to\nthe loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is\nnot necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is\n3\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations\n \u00b6 18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it\nmay lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be\nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nThe government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems reflected\nby his accumulating substantial credit card debts that have persisted. Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.  Applicant\u2019s debts grew\nout of his desire to fund his children\u2019s college education and his poor judgment in trying to finance\nthose expenses through credit cards.  While he has a good  income and limited expenses, he has\nstruggled over several years to resolve his credit problems.  In 2003 he took out a substantial loan\nfrom his 401(k) account to begin to resolve these debts rather than filing for bankruptcy.  In 2006\nhe sold his family home and used some of those proceeds to resolve several other debts.  While\nhe has not erased all of his debts, he has demonstrated a conscientious and consistent approach to\naddressing and resolving the debts as money allows.  He still has financial limitations from\nproviding substantial resources to a child who remains in college.  However, in May 2007 he\nreported she was financially independent.  Overall, he has demonstrated his tenacity and\n\n       AG \u00b6 20(c), (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\n4\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). \n       AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\n5\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  \n       AG\u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\n6\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.  \n7\npersistence in resolving these debts. \nConsequently, Applicant has established a case in mitigation.  Applicant has demonstrated\nhis responsibility by paying the majority of his debts and stating  his intent to pay the remaining\ndebts.  He has developed a plan for how he might pay all his debts as his daughter\u2019s college\nexpenses diminish.   Thus, he  meets  AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  He has a professional and responsible\nposition with a good income, and has limited his personal expenses in order to resolve these dated\ndebts.  To his credit, he has not developed any new debts. \nWhile Applicant provided no evidence of his seeking counseling  for these financial\n4\nproblems, he developed his own plan and made substantial steps to turn around his financial issues.\nHe did not try to establish that the debts were due to conditions beyond his control  even though\n5\nhe subsequently divorced.  AG \u00b6 20(a)  does apply as the circumstances of his wanting to use his\n6\nresources to fund his children\u2019s college education has changed as all his children, but one, are now\nfinancially independent.    \nWhole Person Analysis\nHaving considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept,\nI conclude he is an earnest person who has made many efforts to reform his financial practices and\nhas paid off the majority of his debts.  He has demonstrated amply his intent to resolve them all.\nAlso, he has changed his financial practices and reduced his expenses in order to resolve his debts.\nHe has developed a budget and understands where his money goes.  The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress is slight as he has a stable and impressive employment history.\nNotably, three key people at his site praise him highly and have confidence in his trustworthiness\nand good character.  His direct supervisor since 1986 praised his performance and commended his\nability to save hundreds of thousands of dollars with his innovative techniques to improve\nmaintenance activities.  He also noted Applicant\u2019s honesty, integrity and loyalty. The program\nmanager who has known him for ten years attested to the importance of Applicant\u2019s expertise and\nattested to his outstanding performance ratings in a \u201chighly trusted position.\u201d He recommended\nhim for a security clearance.  The military officer at the site who does the daily quality assurance\nevaluations commended his excellent performance and his integrity. He also recommended\nApplicant for a security clearance.  Based on these assessments of three top officials who know\nApplicant well, I conclude favorably for him based on a whole person assessment.  As he is\nearnestly working to resolve his financial problems, the likelihood of new debts and related\n\n8\nproblems is low. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has  mitigated the security\nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations.  I rule for  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through\n1.f. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines\nin Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the\nfollowing formal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He\nobtained his U.S. passport on January 3, 2005, and claims he used the U.S. passport after he obtained\nit, but he admits he may also have used the Yugoslavian passport.  The Yugoslavian passport shows\na stamp dated May 1, 2004.  The U.S. passport shows travel between December 2005 and January\n2006 to Yugoslavia by way of an airport in Germany.  Both passports have not expired, and\n\n4\nApplicant keeps them at his home.  Applicant is uncertain if the Yugoslavian passport continues to\nbe valid because Yugoslavia no longer exists as a country, having broken into at least five separate\ncountries. (Tr. 35, 36, 47-49; Exhibits 1, 2, 4)\nApplicant traveled to Yugoslavia and Kosovo in 2000, 2004, 2005, and during Thanksgiving\nin 2006.  He will decide in August 2007 when to go to Kosovo again.  While there, he visits his\ndaughter who teaches for a U.S. university in Kosovo.  She is a U.S. citizen who resides in Pristina.\nHe visits his 81-year-old mother, a citizen of Serbia who resides in Pristina, Kosovo, in the Republic\nof Serbia.  He also visits his brother and sister-in-law, who are citizens and residents of Serbia,\nKosovo Province.  Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a nurse in a government hospital.  Applicant owns\nan apartment worth about $60,000 and a house worth about $100,000 in his estimation.  The house\nis on one acre of land.  His mother lives in the house because he has an obligation to take care of his\nparent with the help of his brother.  The family also has a newer home that Applicant and his family\nbuilt for his father, mother, and brother to use.  Applicant also has a brother and sister in Canada.\nIf his mother were not alive, he is uncertain as to whether he would return to visit his other relatives\nin Kosovo.  He calls his mother weekly and his other relatives once every two weeks.  (Tr. 29-32,\n42, 49-59)\nApplicant has dual citizenship with the former Yugoslavia, now called the Republic of\nSerbia.  He declares he would never consider himself a Serbian citizen, a constituent republic of the\nformer Yugoslavia, because of the attacks on Kosovo and its people by Serbia in the 1990s.\nApplicant stated several times he considers himself a Kosovarian.  He stated, \u201cSerbia still treat\nKosovo as own territory and we try to treat ourself as independent country.\u201d (Tr. 32)  Then, he stated,\n\u201cThe problem is we are Kosovors, we are Albanians, and right now these territories are out of\nSerbia.\u201d (Tr. 34)  Applicant also helps his local Albanian community. (Tr. 38)  He stated he would\nreturn to Kosovo if it would help his family, and that \u201cI\u2019m by the law still a Serbian.\u201d (Tr. 43)\nApplicant has not taken any steps to renounce his Serbian citizenship, \u201cBecause I\u2019m not there and\nI still didn\u2019t decide about that.  I\u2019m right now a U.S. citizen and I\u2019m going to stay here.  If Kosovo\nget independence, and we hope all Albanians will get that in the end of June, that will be the question\n. . will I be a dual citizen if . . . \u201c (Tr. 44)  Applicant does not know if he will maintain dual\ncitizenship with Kosovo and the United States.  He wants to wait to see if Kosovo allows dual\ncitizenship if it becomes an independent country.  Presently, he considers himself a U.S. citizen, but\nhe spent 50 years in Kosovo, and therefore, he also considers himself a Kosovarian.  \u201cI\u2019m still\nfeeling that I\u2019m Albanian and I\u2019m Kosovors but if I hurt my new country, ...I will first accept the\nU.S. again citizenship.\u201d (Tr. 45, 46)  He also testified he spent all his life in Kosovo and is \u201cso much\ntied with\u201d his family there, with his \u201cheritage there that I cannot forget . . \u201c (Tr. 51).  He then goes\non to say the U.S. will always be first, but then he states, \u201cI\u2019m an Albanian.\u201d (Tr. 53) (Exhibit 4)\nI take administrative notice of the history of Yugoslavia, both the Socialist Federal Republic\nformed after World War II and led by a Communist government, and??its constituent republics,\nincluding Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia.  As Yugoslavia fractured\nafter the death of its long-time Communist dictator Josip Tito in 1980, Serbia and Montenegro, with\nKosovo as a province of Serbia, formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992.  In May 2006,\nMontenegro held a successful referendum on independence effective June 3 .  Then Yugoslavia\nrd\nbecame the Republic of Serbia.  Kosovo was an autonomous province.  Over the intervening years\nKosovo sought greater autonomy, until armed conflict broke out in 1997 between Kosovo\nindependence seekers and the Serbian government.  The United Nations (U.N.) finally intervened\n\n5\nunder Security Council Resolution 1244 with a NATO-led force.  The future status of Kosovo within\nSerbia or as an independent nation remains under discussion at the U.N.  Serbia has some human\nrights problems, including but not limited to, police violence, harassment of journalists, corruption,\ntrafficking in persons, and violence against women and children.  (Exhibit 4)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.\n\n6\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline C: Foreign Preference: The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. -\nGuideline \u00b6 9.\nGuideline B: Foreign Influence: The Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with the risk of terrorism. Guideline \u00b6 6.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Preference: The possible disqualifying conditions that may raise a security concern\nare the exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\n\n7\ncitizen, including the possession of a current foreign passport and using foreign citizenship to protect\nfinancial or business interests in another country (Paragraph 10.a.1 and 5).  The Government showed\nquite clearly that Applicant has a current Yugoslavian passport and he has not returned it to the\nissuing authority, destroyed it, or otherwise invalidated it.  He used that passport to travel to Kosovo,\neven after he became a U.S. citizen, because he found it easier to cross European borders with it.\nHe also uses his U.S. passport for his travel.  Applicant has $160,000 worth of real estate in Kosovo.\nHe has not renounced his Serbian or Yugoslavian citizenship because it helps him retain his property\ninterests in Kosovo. \nThe Paragraph 10 (d) disqualifying condition refers any statement or action that shows\nallegiance to a country other than the United States.  Applicant repeatedly referred to himself as\nbeing from Kosovo and Albanian.  He likes the U.S. and is grateful to it for helping stop Serbian\nviolence in Kosovo in the 1990s, and providing him and his family with a safe haven, but he never\nonce referred to himself as an \u201cAmerican.\u201d  He seems confused or conflicted about his citizenship\nand which takes priority.  The weight of his comments quoted in Paragraph 4 of the Findings show\nhe considers himself first a citizen of Kosovo and of Albanian heritage.  His allegiance is stronger\nto those two entities than to the U.S., based on his statements at the hearing.\nExamining the mitigating conditions in Paragraph 11, I conclude none apply to Applicant.\nHe never expressed a willingness to renounce his dual citizenship.  In fact, he waffled and appeared\nindecisive on that issue, preferring to wait until the situation in Kosovo and its possible\nindependence in 2007 is clarified or resolved before he makes a final decision.  Having reached his\nmajority long before he came to the U.S., his dual citizenship is not based solely on his parents\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country, but rather his decision..  None of the other mitigating\nconditions apply even minutely.\nForeign Influence:  Security concerns that may be disqualifying are contact with a foreign\nfamily member who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion (Paragraph 7.a.),\nconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between that individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information\n(Paragraph 7.b.),  sharing living quarters with a person if that relationship creates a heightened risk\nof foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion (Paragraph 7.d.), and a substantial\nfinancial or property interest in a foreign country which could subject the individual to heightened\nrisk of foreign influence or exploitation (Paragraph 7.e.).  Applicant has a mother, brother, and\ndaughter in Kosovo.  He owns $160,000 worth of property there.  His wife is a Serbian citizen.\nApplicant exhibited very strong emotional and historical attachments to Kosovo, and Albanian\nnational ethnic identity.  He referred to himself throughout the hearing as Kosovarian or Albanian,\nbut not an American.  Since 2004, he has traveled every year to Kosovo, and has planned another\ntrip after August 2007.\nI considered the mitigating conditions in Paragraph 8 under this Guideline.  None apply.\nApplicant is merely grateful to the U.S.  for helping him and his countrymen against the Serbians.\nHe has not exhibited deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties to the U.S.  His contact\nweekly with his mother and semi-monthly with his brother is not casual or infrequent.  His family\nand ethnic ties are very strong, and he could be placed in a compromising situation of having to\n\n8\nchoose between his loyalties to them and to the U.S.  Applicant has not met his burden of proof that\nany of these mitigating conditions apply to his case.\nWhole Person Analysis:  \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\"\ntrustworthiness decision. Directive E2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive\n\u00b6 E2.2.1.\nConsidering those factors, I am persuaded by Applicant\u2019s own descriptions of his strong\nattachments to Kosovo and Albanians, in addition to his family, that trustworthiness concerns are\npresent constantly.  His age and maturity, in addition to his experience, make him clearly responsible\nfor his attitude and opinions on his attachments.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress are present because of Applicant\u2019s strong attachments and self-identification as a citizen\nof Kosovo and of Albanian ethnic heritage.  Although Kosovo and Albania are not a threat to the\nU.S., there are groups within Kosovo who may be able to coerce Applicant through his property\ninterests and family members to make choices between his loyalty to his family and also to the U.S..\nFinally, Applicant\u2019s attitude and opinions will recur and continue, by his own description, due to his\n50 years of attachment to Kosovo.\nApplicant failed to meet his burden of proof and persuasion that any of the mitigating\nconditions under either of the two trustworthiness concerns should apply.  Therefore, I conclude the\nforeign preference trustworthiness concern against Applicant.  I also conclude the foreign influence\ntrustworthiness concern against Applicant.  Finally, the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d I conclude against\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. to 2.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nHis application for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\n\n9\nPhilip S.

He\nused it three times between December 2004 and July 2005.  He disclosed only two of his five arrests\non his security clearance application in 1990, and he failed to disclose a felony arrest on his\napplication in 2005. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement and\nthe falsifications of his two security clearance applications.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 25, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).  The\nSOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 10, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2007, and heard on April\n19, 2007, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 49-year-old electrical engineer employed by a federal contractor.  He is\nmarried and has two children, one of whom was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China and adopted\nby Applicant and his wife.  He holds an associate\u2019s degree in electrical engineering.  He does not\nhave a clearance at this time (Tr. 7).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from August 2005 until April 2007, a colonel in the U.S. Marine\nCorps Reserve, testified that Applicant\u2019s character and loyalty are beyond reproach (Tr. 41-42).  A\ncoworker and friend from Applicant\u2019s previous private-sector employment testified Applicant was\nvery responsible, extremely intelligent, and a person of impeccable character (Tr. 48).  Applicant\u2019s\nsupervisor in his most recent job, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, recruited\nApplicant to follow him to another company because  of his confidence in his ability and character.\nHe was aware of Applicant\u2019s most recent drug use (Tr. 55-56).\nApplicant was previously employed by a federal contractor from 1982 to 1984 and held a\nclearance.  In a statement executed on May 11, 1983, he admitted to a security investigator that he\nwas arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for failing to disperse during a college campus\ndisturbance (Government Exhibit (GX) 2).  In another statement to the same investigator on May 12,\n1983, Applicant admitted he started using marijuana in 1972, when he was in junior high school.\nHe stated he used it about once a week, taking two to four puffs of a marijuana cigarette.  He also\nadmitted being detained by the police for possession of marijuana that he had purchased.  The police\ndiscovered the marijuana when they arrested Applicant and his companions for trespassing in a\ncollege gymnasium.  Applicant stated he never purchased marijuana again after that incident.  He\nstated that after high school he used marijuana three or four times a year until he stopped using it in\n1981 (GX 3).\n\nThe offense was alleged as \u201cfailure to disburse\u201d in the SOR.  On my own motion, I corrected the SOR to allege\n1\na \u201cfailure to disperse.\u201d (Tr. 96.)\n4\nOn December 10, 1990, Applicant executed a National Agency Questionnaire.  In response\nto question 18, asking if he had ever been arrested, charged, cited, held, or detained by federal, state,\nor other law enforcement or juvenile authorities, he disclosed two arrests for assault and battery in\n1986 and 1988.  He did not disclose his arrest for possession of marijuana in 1972, but he did\ndisclose he had used marijuana in \u201cparty situations\u201d while in college, in response to question 20.  He\nalso failed to disclose an arrest for speeding in 1974, his arrest for failing to disperse in 1979 , and\n1\nan arrest for an unpaid moving violation in 1983.  \nIn a statement to a security investigator on April 11, 1991, Applicant again addressed his\npossession of marijuana in 1972. He admitted he was charged with a misdemeanor and held at the\npolice station until he was released to his father\u2019s custody.  He contradicted his May 1983 statement\nthat he had purchased the marijuana, saying instead that it was given to him (GX 4 at 1-2).  He\nrepudiated his earlier admission of using marijuana weekly in junior high school, and insisted he\nused it only three times in junior high school (GX 4 at 14, 16).  He stated his last use of marijuana\nwas in Amsterdam, where he purchased and smoked it.  It happened while he was on a business trip\nfor the federal contractor for whom he had worked since July 1984 (GX 4 at 13-14; GX 8 at 2).  He\nstated his purchase in Amsterdam was the only time he ever purchased marijuana (GX 4 at 14),\ncontradicting his earlier admission that he purchased it in junior high school. \nIn his April 1991 statement, Applicant also admitted being arrested for speeding on his\nmotorcycle in the summer of 1974, taken to the police station in handcuffs, and being fined $50 (GX\n4 at 2-3).  He admitted being arrested for assault and battery arising from a fight at a house party in\nthe summer of 1984 (GX 4 at 5-6).  He also admitted the arrest for an unpaid moving violation in\nJune 1983.  This arrest occurred when Applicant went to the police station to bail out a friend, and\nwas arrested, photographed, fingerprinted, and jailed because of the unpaid violation (GX 4 at 7).\nFinally, he admitted the felony charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in June 1987,\nand admitted he knew he was charged with a felony (GX 4 at 8)  His admission is corroborated by\ncourt records (GX 5; GX 6; GX 7). \nDuring the April 1991 interview, Applicant told the investigator he did not disclose all his\narrests because he did not think enough about his answer to the question, and he only listed the\noffenses on his local arrest record (GX 4 at 10-11).  At the hearing, he testified he did not disclose\nall his arrests on his 1990 application because he believed the government was only interested in\n\u201cserious stuff\u201d and not minor infractions (Tr. 69-70).  He testified he did not disclose the arrest for\npossession of marijuana because he thought it had been expunged (Tr. 92).  He admitted his May\n1983 statement and April 1991 statement were inconsistent, and he admitted his April 1991\nstatement was incorrect (Tr. 87-91).  He testified he was not sure why he did not disclose the arrest\nfor failing to disperse (Tr. 95).\nApplicant stopped using marijuana while working for a federal contractor between 1982 and\n1984 because his employer had a random drug testing program.  From 1984 to 1990, he used\nmarijuana about six times at social events.  He told a security investigator he used marijuana because\nhe enjoyed the taste.  He also told the investigator that he could not absolutely rule out the possibility\nhe would use marijuana again (GX 4 at 15).\n\n5\nIn September 2000, Applicant disclosed to U.S. immigration authorities that he was arrested\nfor assault and battery in September 1986, and for felony assault and battery in April 1988.  He made\nthe disclosures in connection with his adoption of his infant daughter (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A).\nOn August 22, 2005, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP).  In Section 23, he responded \u201cno\u201d to the question whether he had ever been\ncharged with a felony.  He did not disclose that he was arrested and charged with assault and battery\nwith a dangerous weapon, a felony, in April 1988.  At the hearing, he testified he answered \u201cno\u201d to\nthe question about felony arrests on his 2005 application because he thought it covered only the last\nseven years (Tr. 73-74).\nIn Section 24 of his August 2005 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed smoking marijuana three times\nin July 2005, just before beginning his employment by a federal contractor.  At the hearing, he\nadmitted smoking marijuana with his brother-in-law during a family vacation in July 2005.  He also\nadmitted smoking marijuana with family members during the Christmas season in December 2004\n(Tr. 64).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n\n6\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24.  \u201cDrugs\u201d include \u201cDrugs,\nmaterials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of\n1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens).\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24(a)(1).  Drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24(b).\nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 25(a) and (c).  The evidence in this case establishes\nthese two disqualifying conditions.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of\ndisproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 26(a).  The first clause of \u00b6 26(a) (\u201chappened so long ago\u201d) focuses\non the recency of drug involvement.  There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct\nis \u201crecent.\u201d  The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence.\nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period\nof time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must\ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient\nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d  Id.  \nApplicant has used marijuana with varying degrees of frequency for most of his life, starting\nin junior high school.  The most recent use was shortly before he submitted his e-QIP and less than\ntwo years ago.  When he has abstained from marijuana in the past, his motivation has not been\n\n7\nrespect for the law or concern for his health, but to avoid losing his job.  His motivation for\nabstinence since July 2005 has been his pending security clearance application.  I conclude that the\nmitigating condition in Guidelines \u00b6 26(a) is not established.\nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by evidence of \u201ca\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; [or] (3)\nan appropriate period of abstinence.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 26(b)(1)-(3).  Applicant has not demonstrated\nintent not to abuse drugs in the future.  To the contrary, he has admitted to security investigators that\nhe enjoys marijuana and may use it again.  His drug-using associates in December 2004 and July\n2005 were family members, with whom he continues to associate.  As noted above, his period of\nabstinence has been relatively short and motivated by his pending security clearance application.\nI conclude that the mitigating condition in Guidelines \u00b6 26(b) is not established.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 15.  The\nrelevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 16(a).\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the\nomission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind\nat the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining\nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nApplicant has given contradictory accounts of the frequency, nature, and duration of his drug\ninvolvement and multiple explanations for his failures to fully disclose his criminal record.  In his\nsecurity interviews, he attempted to minimize his early purchases and use of marijuana.  While his\ncontradictory responses to security investigators are not alleged in the SOR, conduct not alleged in\nthe SOR may be considered: \u201c(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant\nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under\nDirective Section 6.3.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted).\nApplicant\u2019s contradictory statements are relevant to determining the credibility of his explanations\nfor omitting information from his two security clearance applications, determining whether any\nmitigating conditions apply, and making a whole-person analysis.  I have considered them for those\nlimited purposes.  \n\n8\nApplicant listed only the two assault and battery arrests on his 1990 application, explaining\nto a security investigator that he did not think enough about his answer and listed only the offenses\non his arrest record.  At the hearing, he testified he listed only the \u201cserious stuff.\u201d  When questioned\nat the hearing, he was able to recall each of his arrests in detail.  When asked why he did not list his\narrest for possession of marijuana, which he knew from previous security investigations was \u201cserious\nstuff,\u201d he testified he did not disclose it because he thought it was expunged.  The evidence suggests\na pattern of minimizing adverse information, falling short of the candor required by the Guidelines.\nEven Applicant\u2019s disclosure of marijuana use on the 2005 application tended to minimize it,\ndisclosing only the July 2005 use but not the December 2004 use.  I conclude he intentionally\nomitted his full arrest record on his 1990 application.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing his felony arrest on his 2005 application was\nequally implausible and unpersuasive.  Section 23 asks the \u201chave you ever\u201d questions first and then\nfollows with two questions limited to the last seven years.  Applicant is obviously very intelligent\nand articulate.  He has previously applied for clearances and knew from his previous experience that\nhis criminal record was a serious concern.  He knew the importance of full disclosure, because he\nhad been questioned during his previous security investigations about his failures to fully disclose\nhis criminal record.  I find Applicant\u2019s explanation that he misread the question unconvincing.  I\nconclude he intentionally omitted his felony conviction on his 2005 application.\nBased on the intentional omissions of relevant and material facts from his two applications,\nI conclude the disqualifying condition in Guidelines \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to\nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Security concerns raised by false or\nmisleading answers on a security clearance application may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 17(a).  \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to correct his omissions were neither prompt nor in good faith.  He\nexecuted the first application alleged in the SOR in December 1990, and he did not provide the\nomitted information or offer an explanation for the omission of his three arrests until he was\nquestioned about them in April 1991.  He offered different explanations for the omissions at the\nhearing, undercutting any claim of good faith.\nHe executed his second application in August 2005.  He did not admit his felony arrest or\noffer an explanation for omitting it from his application until the hearing.  I conclude the mitigating\ncondition in Guidelines \u00b6 17(a) is not established.\n\n9\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines\n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors are discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant\u2019s lifelong use of marijuana demonstrated a lifelong disregard for the law.  He is\nnow a mature adult, a talented engineer, and a devoted husband and father.  However, his lack of\ncandor negates a finding of rehabilitation and may put him in future situations where he will be\nvulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  His lifelong marijuana use and his attitude\nabout it makes recurrence likely.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security concerns based on drug involvement and personal conduct.  Accordingly, I conclude\nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nhim a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. at 29; GE 1.\n2\nTr. at 30; 53-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2.\n3\nTr. at 31-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On December 22, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in\nwriting on January 11, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on February 23, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 6, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for March 22, 2007. Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement. With\nthe consent of the parties, the hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nGovernment offered three exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified, but did not submit any exhibits. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He married in 1998, and has two\nyoung children.2\nApplicant was a heavy marijuana user as a teenager and into adulthood. He also used other\ndrugs, but his drug of choice was marijuana. In 1973, when Applicant was 18 years old, he was\narrested for the felony offense of possession of marijuana, after marijuana was found in his\npossession while boarding an airplane.3\nApplicant was arrested in 1980, and charged with obstructing a public place. Applicant was\npart of a labor union that had called a strike. Applicant and a number of other union members were\narrested while picketing. Charges were dismissed without a finding of guilt.  \n4\nApplicant grew up on a farm, and had experience in that area. In about 1990, Applicant and\nseveral friends decided to grow marijuana. They grew it for personal use, thinking they would have\n\nTr. at 32-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2; GE 3.\n5\nTr. at 18-19, 35-38.\n6\nTr. at 31-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2; GE 3.\n7\nTr. at 38-50.\n8\nId.\n9\nId.\n10\n4\nall the marijuana they could want. They also planned on selling some of the marijuana. They grew\nthe marijuana in a house under controlled lighting. When Applicant was arrested in February 1990,\nthey had approximately 400 marijuana plants that were about eight inches tall.  \n5\nAs a condition of his release pending trial, Applicant attended a drug rehabilitation program.\nHe successfully completed this program, as well as a number of other drug counseling programs\nwhile incarcerated.6\nApplicant was charged with the federal offenses of conspiracy to manufacture and possess\nwith intent to distribute marijuana; manufacturing over 100 marijuana plants; and possession with\nintent to distribute over 100 marijuana plants. Applicant pled guilty to manufacturing over 100\nmarijuana plants. He was sentenced to five years incarceration, plus four years of supervised release\nfollowing his incarceration.  \n7\nApplicant was incarcerated in a federal prison from November 1, 1990, until September 19,\n1991. From the federal prison, he was transferred to a minimum security facility. Applicant\ncontinued to be considered a federal detainee at this facility. The facility at one time was a military\nbarracks. There were four persons per room. A head count was done several times per day. The\nindividual rooms were never locked. Applicant believes the building was also unlocked, but there\nwere guards at the door. The guards were unarmed. Specific times were designated for the dining\nhall, exercise at the gym, and the yard. Detainees could not wander around the yard, they had to wait\nuntil permitted. Violations of the rules could warrant a return to the federal prison.8\nThe facility was co-ed, with male and female detainees. Interaction such as sitting together\nat meals and playing cards was permitted, but physical contact was strictly forbidden, and would\nresult in return to a higher security facility. Applicant was regularly drug tested, and tested for HIV.9\nApplicant and other detainees were transported by bus during the work week to a military\ninstallation where they performed manual labor. Applicant\u2019s job for about his first year in the facility\nwas as a janitor for the military police. Applicant was paid minimal wages for this work, between\n$.17 and $.53 per hour, similar to what was paid to the detainees at the prison.  \n10\nThe detainees were periodically permitted off the facility, but always with a guard. Applicant\nsaw a play, and played softball away from the facility. Furloughs were sometimes authorized for\nmedical or family emergencies, usually toward the end of the sentence. Applicant was in the facility\nalmost two years before he was granted a furlough. He had several furloughs including when his\n\nId.; GE 3.\n11\nTr. at 23, 44-49; GE 3.\n12\nTr. at 23-26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1 at 2.\n13\nTr. at 26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n14\nTr. at 60.\n15\nTr. at 22, 26-27, 51-53.\n16\n5\nfather passed away. Furloughs were the only occasions that an detainee would be outside the facility\nunsupervised.11\nApplicant was released from this facility on November 3, 1994. When he was released, he\nmoved to his current state of residence. Applicant continued on the supervised release program until\nthe probation office petitioned the Court to release him from the program because of his good record.\nThe Court granted Applicant\u2019s release two years early.12\nSince his incarceration, Applicant attended community college on a President\u2019s Scholarship,\nand received honors. He graduated from a four-year college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999.\nApplicant has had steady employment since 1994. He is a landowner and a landlord, renting out\nseveral properties.13\nApplicant actively serves on his Neighborhood Watch. He was asked to be captain, but he\ndeclined, thinking that it would not be appropriate because of his criminal record.  \n14\nApplicant has not been arrested, and has only two traffic citations, since 1990. He has not\nused any illegal drugs since 1990.15\nApplicant did not request friends, neighbors or co-workers to submit character evidence\nbecause he prefers that they do not know about his criminal record. Applicant would not permit his\nrecord to be used as a means to coerce him to reveal classified information, and would willingly\nreveal his record if necessary. His record is not a total secret, he simply does not volunteer the\ninformation. Applicant has been an advocate of repealing mandatory minimum sentencing laws. He\nhas appeared on network television and in the newspapers discussing his case. He also informed his\nsupervisor about his record.16\nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n22\n6\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n17\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n18\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n19\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n20\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n21\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n22\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\n\n7\nCriminal activity creates doubt about an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s drug-related criminal activity in 1973 and 1990, establish Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and CC\nDC 31(c) (allegation or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). There is insufficient evidence that Applicant\ncommitted a criminal offense when he was arrested for picketing in 1980. I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.b in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions as they relate to CC DC 31(a) and CC DC\n31(c), and especially considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) 32(a) (so much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment), and CC MC 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement).\nApplicant\u2019s last criminal activity, other than minor traffic offenses, was more than 16 years\nago. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct was drug-related. He successfully completed drug rehabilitation\nbefore his incarceration, and has not used illegal drugs since 1990. Applicant is a model of a\nsuccessful rehabilitation. His testimony was sincere and he displayed the appropriate remorse for his\ncrimes. He had earned honors and received a President\u2019s Scholarship while attending community\ncollege, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a four-year university. He has a good employment\nrecord. Applicant is a landowner and landlord for several properties. He demonstrated his\ncommunity involvement by his active participation in his Neighborhood Watch program. CC MC\n32(a) and 32(d) both apply.\nThis case also falls under CC DC 31(f) (conviction in a Federal or State court, including a\ncourt-martial, of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and\nincarceration as a result of that sentence for not less than a year), which implements 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\n986. Under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1), the Department of Defense is prohibited from granting a security\nclearance to any applicant who was convicted of an offense in a U.S. court, was sentenced to more\nthan one year in jail, and was incarcerated as a result of that conviction for at least one year. \nApplicant was convicted in Federal court, and sentenced to five years incarceration, plus four\nyears of supervised release following his incarceration. He was incarcerated in a federal prison from\nNovember 1, 1990, until September 19, 1991. From the federal prison, Applicant was transferred\nto a minimum security facility, in what would be described as a \u201cwork-release\u201d program, where he\ncontinued to serve his sentence until he was released on November 3, 1994.\nThe key issue in this case is whether Applicant\u2019s time in the work-release program in the\nminimum security facility constituted incarceration. The Appeal Board has stated that the specifics\nof each case must be scrutinized in order to determine if an applicant\u2019s work-release constitutes\nincarceration for the purposes of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986: \n\nISCR Case No. 04-00354 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2007).\n23\nTr. at 57-59. United States v. Ruffin, 40 F. 3d 1296 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Carter v. McCaleb, 29 F. Supp. 2d 423\n24\n(W.D. Mich. 1998); Asquith v. Volunteers of America, 1 F. Supp. 2d 405 (D. N.J. 1998).\nFor excellent analyzes of work-release programs as applicable to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, see ISCR Case No. 03-\n25\n08336 (A.J. Jan. 17, 2006), and ISCR Case No. 02-21013 (A.J. Nov. 28, 2005).\nApplicant never disputed that he was incarcerated. He argued for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.\n26\n8\nThe question of whether work-release should be considered incarceration for\npurposes of the Smith Act is a mixed question of fact and law. The Board cannot\nassume that the many such programs functioning concurrently in the United States\nnecessarily impose the same restrictions on convicts.23\nDepartment Counsel cites several federal cases that held that work-release constituted\nimprisonment in matters unrelated to security clearances.  I also considered United States v.\n24\nTimbrook, 290 F. 3d 957 (7  Cir. 2002).   In Timbrook, the issue was whether a sentence of work\nth\n25\nrelease in a county jail is a sentence of imprisonment, as that term was used in the U.S. Sentencing\nGuidelines. In that case, Timbrook was sentenced to four years of probation, including six months\nof work release. Timbrook was locked up in the county jail when he was not at work. The court\nconcluded the sentence to a work-release program as part of probation was a sentence of\nimprisonment. Although Timbrook was not a security clearance case, and involved application of\nthe Sentencing Guidelines, rather than 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, the reasoning of the court is persuasive.\nUnder the specifics of this case, as discussed above, I find that Applicant\u2019s time in the minimum\nsecurity facility on work-release constituted incarceration for the purposes of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.26\nApplicant was therefore incarcerated for much more than one year. CC DC 31(f) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\n986 are both applicable. \nThe statute also provides that an exception to the prohibition may be authorized in a\nmeritorious case if there are mitigating factors. The waiver provision of the statute is implemented\nin CC MC 32(e) (potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be mitigated unless,\nwhere meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries of the Military Departments or designee, or\nthe Directors of Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),\nNational Security Agency (NSA), and Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) or designee,\nhas granted a waiver). Applicant cannot be granted a clearance under the provisions of 10 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 986(c)(1), unless he is granted a waiver. \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\n\n9\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed\nabove. \nApplicant committed a serious offense in 1990, resulting in his incarceration for several\nyears. As noted above, I find that he is rehabilitated. He presented sufficient information under CC\nMC 32(a) and 32(d) to mitigate his criminal conduct. However, absent a waiver, he still cannot be\ngranted access to classified information under CC DC 31(f) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non his criminal conduct. However, based solely on 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1), Applicant\u2019s clearance must\nbe denied. In accordance with DOHA Operating Instruction No. 64, dated September 12, 2006, a\ncopy of this decision will be forwarded to the Director, DOHA, for a determination whether to\nexercise his discretion to grant a waiver in accordance with 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(d). \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance\nis denied based solely on 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1).\nEdward W. Loughran\nAdministrative Judge\n",

However, she has offered little to show she has\naddressed any of her admitted past due debts.  The Applicant\u2019s excessive indebtedness has not been\nmitigated.  A determination of trustworthiness and access to personal sensitive information is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD C3I) entered into a memorandum of\nagreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed\nin Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January of 1987.\nOn August 7, 2006, DOHA, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\ndetermination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive\nSystems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on September 7, 2006, in which she elected to have\nthis case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment's File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 29, 2007.  Applicant was instructed to\nsubmit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of\nthe FORM.  Applicant received her copy on February 9, 2007, and Applicant's Reply was received\non February 15, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned for resolution on March 8, 2007.  The Applicant\nadmits the underlying factual basis of the allegations, except for the debts noted in subparagraphs\n1.g., 1.j., 1.o. and 1.p.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of\nRelevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 53 years of age, and is employed by\na defense contractor who seeks an ADP-I/II/III position on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete\nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make\nthe following additional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant, a single mother with two children, suffered a heart attack and a subsequent\nstroke in the 2002~2003 time frame; and as a result, incurred considerable financial difficulties\n(Reply).\n1.a.~1.f., 1.h., 1.i., and 1.k.~1.n.

According to the most recent CR, the Applicant is indebted to three\nadditional creditors in the amount of about $30,000 (Item 7 at pages 2 and 3).  Although she denies\nthese allegations, she has offered little in support of her contention; and as such, I find these\nsubparagraphs against the Applicant.\n1.g.  The Applicant denies a $3,693 past due debt to \u201cPinnacle,\u201d an account placed in\ncollection by \u201cWachovia.\u201d  As this alleged debt does not appear on the most recent CR, I find this\nsubparagraph for the Applicant.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\n\n5\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant is presently qualifies for access to classified information.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant\u2019s has a plethora of past due debts.  Under Financial Considerations, the first\nand the third disqualifying conditions are applicable as the Applicant had a \u201chistory of not meeting\n[her] financial obligations,\u201d and there was an \u201c[i]nability or unwillingness to satisfy [her] debts.\u201d\nHowever, the Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties can be attributed to circumstances \u201clargely beyond\n. . . [her] control (e.g., . . . unexpected medical emergency . . . ).\u201d  The third mitigating condition is\ntherefore applicable.  However, the Applicant has done little, other than her representations in her\nReply, to address what are, for the most part, admitted past due debts.  Mitigation is not shown.\nGuideline F is found against the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding\nher Financial Considerations.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guideline\nF, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has not met her ultimate burden of\npersuasion under Guideline F.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\na.

The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under\nDepartment of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, (Jan. 1987), as amended\n(the \u201cRegulation\u201d), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On August 23,\n2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR\nalleges security concerns raised under the Criminal Conduct, Financial Considerations, and Personal\nConduct guidelines of the Directive.  A copy of the Directive was provided to Applicant.  The\nCriminal Conduct, Financial Considerations, and Personal Conduct guidelines of the Directive and\nthe Criminal Conduct, Financial Considerations, and Personal Conduct adjudicative guidelines at\nAppendix 8 of the Regulation are, for all practical purposes, identical.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 25, 2006, and requested that his case\nbe determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on February 7, 2007.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1\nthrough 9.  By letter dated February 9, 2007, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with\ninstructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.\nApplicant timely filed additional information.  On March 29, 2007, the case was assigned to me for\na decision.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains 24 allegations of disqualifying conduct under the Criminal Conduct,\nFinancial Considerations, and Personal Conduct Guidelines of Appendix 8 of DoD 5200.2-R.  Ten\nallegations relate to criminal conduct; twelve allegations relate to financial considerations, and two\nallegations relate to personal conduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nine allegations\nunder the Criminal Conduct guideline and denied one allegation.  He admitted eleven allegations\nunder the Financial Considerations guideline, and neither admitted nor denied one allegation.  He\ndenied one allegation and admitted one allegation under the Personal Conduct guideline.  He noted\nmitigating conditions.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.\n\n3\nApplicant is 39 years old and employed as a computer operator by a defense contractor.  He\nearned a high school diploma in June 1985, and he has worked for his present employer since June\n1987.  He is unmarried.  (Item 4; Answer to FORM at 1.)\nApplicant submitted a signed Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF-85P), which he\ndated August 19, 2004, and October 8, 2004.  He certified, with his signature, the following\nstatement:\nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true,\ncomplete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are\nmade in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful  false\nstatement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or\nboth (See section 1001 of title 18, United States Code.)\n Question 20 on the SF-85P reads, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cYour Police Record  In the\nlast 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)? (Leave out\ntraffic fines of less than $150.)\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 20.  (Item 4 at 7.)\nQuestion 22 on the SF-85P addresses an applicant\u2019s financial record.  Question 22b asks:\n\u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?  Include loans or\nobligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question\n22b.  (Item 4 at 7.)  \nApplicant has a history of criminal activity.  In June 1995, he was arrested and charged with\ntwo counts of drawing and uttering a fraudulent check of less than $500.  (SOR allegation 1.a.)  In\nAugust 1995, he was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to pay a fine of approximately $396\non each count and court costs of $20.  (Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 1-2.)\nIn December 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with one count of drawing and\nuttering a fraudulent check of less than $500 in October 1995.  In January 1996, he was found guilty\nand sentenced to pay a fine of approximately $396 and court costs of $20.  (SOR allegation 1.b.)\n(Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2.)\nIn April 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with three counts of drawing and uttering\na fraudulent check of less than $500 in October 1995.  In June 1996 he was found guilty on one\ncount and sentenced to pay a fine of about $208 and court costs of $20.  The remaining two counts\nwere dismissed.  (SOR allegation 1.c.)  (Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2.)\nIn May 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with two counts of drawing and uttering\na fraudulent check of less than $500 in March 1996.  In June 1996, Applicant was found guilty on\nboth counts and sentenced to pay a fine of approximately $396 on each count and court costs of $20.\n(SOR allegation 1.d.)  (Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2.) \nIn July 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under a suspension.  In August\n1996, he was found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of approximately $376. (SOR allegation 1.e.)\n(Item 6 at 3.)  Also in July 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with two counts of drawing and\n\nApplicant denied he was arrested, charged, or convicted in the matter.  The Government presented credible\n1\nevidence to corroborate the SOR allegation that Applicant had been arrested and charged with bank fraud. (Items 5 and\n6.)  The Government\u2019s evidence did not support a finding that Applicant was found guilty of the charge and sentenced\nto a fine of an unspecified amount.\nQuestion 20 asks an applicant to list any arrests, charges, and convictions in the last 7 years and  does not draw\n2\ndistinctions between misdemeanors and felonies.\n4\nuttering a fraudulent check of less than $500.  In August 1996, he was found guilty on one count and\nsentenced to pay a fine of approximately $376.  (SOR allegation 1.f.)  (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 3.)   \nIn January 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with drawing and uttering a fraudulent\ncheck.  (SOR allegation 1.g.)  (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 3.)  In September 1998, Applicant was arrested\nand charged with drawing and uttering a fraudulent check in May 1998.  ( SOR allegation 1.h.)\n(Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 3.)\nIn October 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with bank fraud in August 2000.1\n(SOR allegation 1.i.)  (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 3; Answer to FORM at 1.)  In May 2004, Applicant was\narrested and charged with three counts of drawing and uttering a fraudulent check of less than $500\nin December 2003.  In June 2004, he was found guilty on one count and sentenced to pay a fine of\napproximately $396.  The remaining two counts were dismissed.  (SOR allegation 1.j.)  (Item 5 at\n3; Item 6 at 3; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct was alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.j. of the SOR.  Applicant\nadmitted the allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h. and allegation 1.j.  He denied the allegation at \u00b6 1.i.\nand stated he was not arrested in the jurisdiction cited in the allegation.  The record does not support\nDOHA\u2019s assertion that Applicant was found guilty of the crime charged in \u00b6 1.i. and sentenced to\npay a fine of an unspecified amount.  (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 3.)  The evidence shows Applicant was\narrested in August 2004 after completing his SF-85P and charged with one count of drawing and\nuttering a fraudulent check in December 2003.  This arrest and charge were not alleged in the SOR.\n(Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 4.) \nApplicant also has a history of financial delinquencies, some of which date to at least 2001.\nThe SOR identified approximately $14, 500 in debts owed by Applicant.  He admitted eleven of the\ntwelve financial delinquencies alleged in the SOR.  He neither admitted nor denied the allegation\nat \u00b6 2.c., identifying a debt of $70 which was placed in collection status when a check he presented\nfor payment was returned.  The debt is shown as unpaid as of June 27, 2006, and February 2, 2007\n(Item 8; Item 9.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report for October 2004, shows several debts as more than 180 days\ndelinquent: \u00b6\u00b6 2.f., 2.i., 2.j., 2.k., and 2.l.  Other debts alleged by DOHA and admitted by Applicant\ndemonstrate on-going financial delinquencies.  \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.b., 2.d., 2.e., 2.g., and 2.h.  Nothing in the\nrecord suggests Applicant has sought financial counseling.\nApplicant denied deliberately falsifying material facts in his answer to Question 20 on the\nSF 85P. (SOR allegation \u00b6 3.a.)  He stated he didn\u2019t know that drawing and uttering a fraudulent\ncheck under $500 was a felony.  (Answer ro FORM at 1.)   He denied the arrest, charge, and\n2\nconviction alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. but provided no evidence to rebut the allegation.  He admitted SOR\n\n5\nallegation 1.j., but he denied responsibility for the conduct.  He said the criminal acts were\ncommitted by his friend, but he offered no evidence to rebut the allegation.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to\nFORM at 1.)  Applicant admitted deliberately falsifying his response to Question 22b on the SF-85P.\nPOLICIES\nThe ADP adjudication process extends only to sensitive positions.  Positions designated as\nADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions; ADP III positions are not.  Regulation \u00b6 AP\n10.2.  By memorandum dated November 19, 2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security directed DOHA to extend the adjudicative process to ADP III\npositions as well.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . .assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . .assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  Regulation\n\u00b6 C6.1.1.1.  Appendix B of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.  DoD\ncontractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.  Regulation\n\u00b6 C8.2.1.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Government\u2019s concern under the Criminal Conduct Guideline of the Regulation is that\na history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  Two conditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) (1): any conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged and DC (2): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\nApplicant was charged with drawing and uttering fraudulent checks on eight separate\noccasions between June 1995 and May 2004.  He was charged and convicted of driving under a\nsuspended license and was sentenced to pay a fine.  He was also arrested and charged with bank\nfraud, although he disputed the location of the jurisdiction where the arrest took place.  Applicant\u2019s\nactions demonstrate a pattern of criminal conduct and raise concerns under DC 1 and DC 2.\nThree Mitigating Conditions (MC) under the Criminal Conduct Guideline might apply to\nApplicant\u2019s conduct.  His criminal conduct might be mitigated if it was not recent (MC 1), if his\ncrime was an isolated incident (MC 2), and if he demonstrated clear evidence of successful\nrehabilitation (MC 5).  However, Applicant\u2019s most recent charge of criminal behavior occurred in\n2004, making it relatively recent, especially when viewed against his established pattern of criminal\nconduct dating to 1995.  Additionally, his crimes were multiple and not isolated, and there is no clear\n\nDC 1 reads: \u201cA history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d DC 2 reads: \u201dDeceptive or illegal financial\n3\npractices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive\nloan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust.\u201d  DC 3 reads: \u201cInability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts.\u201d\n6\nevidence of successful rehabilitation.  Accordingly, I conclude that MC 1, MC 2, and MC 5 are\ninapplicable.\nApplicant denied SOR allegation 1.i., and the Government did not provide substantial\ncredible evidence to prove Applicant was convicted and sentenced of the crime alleged.\nAccordingly, I conclude SOR allegation 1.i. for Applicant.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Government\u2019s concern under the Financial Considerations Guideline of the Regulation\nis that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay their just debts\nmay try to generate funds by engaging in illegal acts.  Applicant has a history of not meeting his\nfinancial obligations, and his financial history suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy his\ndebts.  Additionally, Applicant has engaged in deceptive or illegal financial practices, including bank\nfraud and drawing and uttering fraudulent checks.  Applicant\u2019s conduct raises security concerns\nunder Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1, 2, and 3 of the Financial Considerations Guideline.3\nFour Mitigating Conditions could potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct.  His disqualifying\nconduct could be mitigated under Mitigating Condition (MC) 1 if it was not recent.  If Applicant\u2019s\nconduct was an isolated incident, then MC 2 might apply.  MC 3 might apply Applicant had received\nor was receiving financial counseling and there were clear indications that his financial problems\nwere begin resolved or were under control.  MC 6 might apply if Applicant had initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay his overdue creditors or to otherwise resolve his debts.  None of these Mitigating\nConditions apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nThe Government has established, through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence,\na prima facie case that Applicant is financially overextended and has engaged in deceptive and\nillegal financial practices.  Applicant provided no credible evidence to rebut or mitigate the financial\nconcerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions under the Financial\nConsiderations Guideline of the Regulation. \nPersonal Conduct\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his answers to Questions 20 and\n22b on SF-85P form he executed and signed in August 2004.  (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. and 3.b.)  In\nhis answer to the SOR, Applicant denied he had deliberately failed to acknowledge and list his police\nrecord in response to Question 20.  He disputed the identify of the jurisdiction in which he was\narrested for bank fraud. He also stated that a friend wrote the fraudulent checks which resulted in his\narrest, charge and conviction on one count of drawing and uttering a fraudulent check (under $500)\nin June 2004.\n\n7\nThe record shows multiple arrests for drafting and uttering fraudulent checks, including a\nconviction about two months before Applicant executed and signed his SF-85P.  Applicant admitted\nnine of the ten criminal acts alleged in the SOR.  This conduct occurred while he was working for\nhis current employer.  Applicant had a strong motive not to reveal his criminal conduct, and his\ndenial that he deliberately falsified his answer to Question 20 lacks credibility.  He admitted he\ndeliberately falsified his response to Question 22b by denying he had debts that were over 180 days\npast due.\nUnder Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2 of the Personal Conduct Guideline, a security concern\nis raised by the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from\nany personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  A security concern is\nraised under DC 4 of the Regulation by personal conduct or concealment of information that\nincreases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Applicant was aware\nof his multiple arrests and criminal conduct.  He was also aware of his financial delinquencies since\nat least 2001, but he had neither sought financial counseling nor developed a plan to pay his\ncreditors.  After completing his SF-85P in August 2004, he signed a certification attesting that his\nanswers to the applications were true, complete, correct and made in good faith.  His conduct raises\nconcerns under DC 2 and DC 4 of the Personal Conduct Guideline.\nSeveral Mitigating Conditions (MC) might apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct.  If the falsification\nwas an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct\ninformation voluntarily, MC 2 might apply.  If the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to\ncorrect the falsification before being confronted with the facts, then MC 3 might apply.  If the\nindividual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure, then MC 5 might apply.\nAn applicant\u2019s financial history is material to a determination of his or her eligibility for\naccess to sensitive information.  With respect to the Personal Conduct alleged in SOR subparagraph\n3.a., Applicant\u2019s statements that his falsifications were not deliberate lacked credibility. He omitted\nand concealed relevant and material information about his police record and financial delinquencies\nin response to Questions 20 and 22b, bringing his conduct under DC 2.  He did not make a prompt,\ngood-faith effort to correct the falsifications before being confronted with the facts, and thus MC 3\ndoes not apply.  Applicant\u2019s falsifications were recent and not isolated incidents, and he did not\nsupply the correct information voluntarily.  Thus MC 2 does not apply.  \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate concealment of his police record and financial delinquencies increased\nhis vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. He has not taken positive steps to reduce or\neliminate his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, and thus MC 5 does not apply.  With\nrespect to the Personal Conduct Guideline conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has\nestablished its case.\nWhole Person Analysis\nAppendix 8 of the Regulation requires that the adjudicative process examine a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable\n\n8\nsecurity risk.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as\nthe whole person concept.  In determining an individual\u2019s eligibility for assignment to sensitive\nduties, an administrative judge must not only assess conduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but\nhe or she must also carefully weigh a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  The\nfactors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\nthe voluntariness of participation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct ; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress; and the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct and failure to pay his debts over a period of many years raises\nserious security concerns.  Applicant, a high school graduate, was a mature adult when he\ndeliberately falsified his SF-85P by failing to acknowledge his police record and his financial\ndelinquencies.  He repeatedly drafted and uttered fraudulent checks over a nine-year period.  His\nchronic criminal conduct and his unwillingness to acknowledge and carry out his legal duties to pay\nhis just debts suggest he may not take his legal duty to carry out sensitive duties seriously.  His\ncurrent situation suggests his financial difficulties are likely to continue.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.\nAdjudications regarding eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties are not intended to assign guilt\nor to impose further punishment for past transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the process is the\nfair-minded, common sense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for assignment to\nsensitive duties.  Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the\ntotality of his or her acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having\ndone so, I conclude Applicant should not be entrusted with eligibility for assignment to sensitive\nduties.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate\nfactors and guidelines in Department of Defense Directive, 5220.6., as amended, and Department\nof Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, as amended.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nMy conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.l.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Personal Conduct:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n9\nSubparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to\nsensitive duties.  Eligibility is denied.\nJoan Caton Anthony\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Most of those debts related to car payments or repairs.  By August 2006,\nApplicant\u2019s monthly expenditures exceeded her income.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems have been\nexacerbated by her husband\u2019s job insecurity.  Prior to the hearing, Applicant retained an attorney to\nfile for bankruptcy protection on her behalf.  As part of the bankruptcy process, she will receive debt\nmanagement counseling.\nIn resolving her case, the Judge commended Applicant for her decision to take control of her\nfinancial situation through bankruptcy.  However, he weighed this positive step against the length\nof time it took Applicant to begin resolving her debt problems.  Furthermore, he concluded that the\nrecord provided little reason to believe that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will not recur after\ndischarge in bankruptcy.  Therefore, while the Judge considered Applicant\u2019s efforts to solve her\nproblems, he did not find those efforts sufficient to meet Applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion.

She later experienced other financial difficulties that resulted in three delinquent\ndebts totaling about $14,800. Security concerns about her finances are mitigated because her debts\narose through circumstances beyond her control. Applicant\u2019s omission of some of her debts from her\nPublic Trust Position Application (SF 85P) in May 2005 was an error and not intended to be a false\nanswer or to mislead the government. Available information is sufficient to mitigate the security\nconcerns about her personal conduct and her finances. Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is\ngranted.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 19, 2005, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P). After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n1\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a position of trust. On August 31,\n2006, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise\ntrustworthiness concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and\nGuideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was originally\nassigned to another administrative judge, but transferred to me on November 20, 2006. I convened\na hearing on January 9, 2007, at which the parties appeared as scheduled. The government offered\nseven exhibits, all of which were admitted without objection (Gx. 1 - 7). Applicant testified and\nintroduced three exhibits (Ax. A - C),  which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on January 17, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1 that Applicant was discharged of her debts through a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition in February 1998 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); she owes $6,173 for a debt placed for\ncollection in June 2002 (SOR  \u00b6 1.b); she owes $8,552 for an unpaid account charged off in February\n2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and she owes $152 for an unpaid medical bill placed for collection in June 2003\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). The government also alleged Applicant deliberately falsified her response to question\n20 of her SF 85P (\u201cYour Financial Record - 180-Day Delinquencies. Are you now over 180 days\ndelinquent on any loan or financial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed\nby the Federal Government.)\u201d) by omitting the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d (SOR \u00b6 2.a).\nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c, but denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and\n2.a. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the\ntranscript and exhibits, I make the following findings of additional relevant fact:\nApplicant is 60 years old and has worked since January 2005, first through a temporary\nagency and later as a permanent hire, for a health care and medical insurance company contracted\nto manage medical insurance claims and information for TRICARE, the Department of Defense\n(DoD) medical insurance system for military personnel and their families. She was gainfully\nemployed during the previous six years except for periods of unemployment between December\n2004 and January 2005, and two weeks in November 2004. Applicant was also unemployed from\nMarch 2002 until April 2004 after she was injured on the job and later contracted a thyroid disorder.\n\n Gx. 1; Tr., 42, 63 - 64.\n2\n Tr., 43, 66.\n3\n Tr., \n4\n Id.\n5\n Gx. 4 and 5.\n6\n Ax. C; Tr., 51 - 52.\n7\n Ax. B.\n8\n4\nFor about half that time she received disability and unemployment compensation totaling about $700\na month.2\nApplicant was married from 1971 until 1997. She and her husband have one child, now\ngrown and living with Applicant. They divorced after her husband \u201cran off with his secretary.\u201d3\nWhile married, Applicant worked part-time for a local school district. After her divorce, she\nstruggled financially and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in November 1997. She was\ndischarged of $5,959 in debt (against $3,617 in assets) in February 1998.4\nOn May 19, 2005, Applicant applied for a position of trust by submitting an SF 85P.  In\n5\nresponse to question 20 (debts currently more than 180 days past due), Applicant disclosed only an\nunpaid medical bill. During the ensuing background investigation, the government obtained two\ncredit reports  that showed she also owes $6,173 for a delinquent credit card referred to the Palisades\n6\ncollection agency in June 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that she owes Americredit $8,552 for a delinquent\naccount charged off in February 2003 as a business loss (SOR \u00b6 1.c).\nApplicant denied intentionally omitting the Palisades and Americredit debts from her SF 85P.\nWhen she completed the form, she first filled out by hand a worksheet that listed all of the SF 85P\nquestions.  The worksheet is 21 pages in length and both of these creditors are listed on the last page.\n7\nApplicant testified she had help transferring the information from the worksheet to the automated\nSF 85P form on a computer, but she has no explanation why these debts were not put into the\nautomated form. \nThe debt Applicant listed in response to question 20 shows the creditor as \u201cCHW Medical\nFoundation.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant owes $152 for an unpaid medical bill referred for\ncollection in June 2002. At hearing she produced information to show that CHW is the same creditor\nas that listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Her information also showed this debt was satisfied through insurance\ncoverage not long after she received the medical services. Thinking she still owed the debt, she paid\nit in August 2005. The creditor reimbursed her in November 2006.8\nThe debt to Americredit is the balance of a used car loan remaining after Applicant returned\nthe car in 2002 because it was a lemon. It broke down several times during and after the 90-day\nwarranty was in effect, and either the dealer would not make the necessary repairs or Applicant could\nnot afford to keep sending it to the garage because she was unemployed starting in 2002. Applicant\n\n Tr., 48 - 51.\n9\n Tr., 46 - 48.\n10\n Gx. 2.\n11\n Gx. 3.\n12\n Directive, Enclosure 2.\n13\n A memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and\n14\nSecurity to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004), directed that adjudication of\ntrustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions be resolved using the provisions of the Directive rather than, as\noriginally drafted, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, as amended (Regulation). Positions\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions in section AP10.2.1 of the Regulation. ADP III\npositions are nonsensitive positions. (Regulation, AP102.3.1) By virtue of the aforementioned memorandum, however,\neven though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same\nguidelines and procedures as ADP I and II cases.\n The November 19, 2004, memorandum did not specify whether the guidelines contained in the Directive or\n15\nthe Regulation should be used in ADP cases. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth essentially the same adjudicative\npolicy, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions associated with each guideline, as is contained\n5\nhas had no contact with this creditor, and it does not appear they have tried to collect this debt since\n2002. She does not know how to have this debt removed from her credit history.9\nApplicant\u2019s debt to Palisades is for a Providian credit card account that became delinquent\nduring Applicant\u2019s unemployment due to injury in 2002. She relied too much on the card to cover\nsome expenses during that time, but eventually could not keep up with the payments and meet her\nother expenses. Her attempts to negotiate a repayment plan with the collection agency were\nunsuccessful as they insisted full payment was her only option. Applicant would like to repay this\ndebt, but can do so only if she can negotiate affordable payments.10\nApplicant lives with her adult daughter, who has a job but is paying off her student loans and\nis able to contribute only marginally to Applicant\u2019s household expenses. When she responded to\nDOHA interrogatories in August 2006, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) that\nshowed she had a negative cash flow each month. This was based on a stated net monthly income\nof $1,000.48. However, also attached to her response was a copy of her pay statement for a two-week\npay period in March 2006 that showed her take home pay for two weeks was $1,000.28, which\nmeant she had a monthly net income of at least $2,000.  An earlier pay statement from her\n11\nemployment with a temporary agency in September 2005 showed her one-week pay with eight hours\nof overtime was $548, again resulting in a monthly net income of around $2,000.  I find that the\n12\nnegative monthly cash flow reflected in her August 2006 PFS was erroneous.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an\n13\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information.  Each trustworthiness determination must\n14\nreflect consideration of both disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions  under each\n15\n\nin Enclosure 2 of the Directive. DoD contractor personnel, such as this Applicant, are afforded the adjudication\nprocedures contained in the Directive. Because it appears Applicant was given along with the SOR the adjudicative\nmaterials from the Directive, I have referred to the factors contained in the Directive rather than the Regulation in\nreaching this decision.\n Directive, 6.3.\n16\n \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n17\nconcept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should\nconsider the following factors:\n \nE2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\n \nE2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation;\n \nE2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n \nE2.2.1.7. The motivation for the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n \nE2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence;\u201d\n Regulation, C6.1.1.1. \n18\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531(1988).\n19\n See Egan; Directive, E2.2.2.\n20\n6\nadjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case. Each determination must\nalso reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of all available relevant and material\ninformation,  and it must reflect the adjudication process outlined in the Directive at Section\n16\nE2.2.1.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of\n17\na conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant\nor denial of access to sensitive information.\nTrustworthiness determinations are intended solely to resolve whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security  for an applicant to receive or continue to have access to\n18\nsensitive  information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information\non which it based the preliminary decision against the applicant. Additionally, the government must\nbe able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the\nburden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. As with\nsecurity clearances, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access.  Thus, an applicant bears a heavy burden\n19\nof persuasion. Access to sensitive information is a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each\napplicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect\nsensitive information pertaining to the national interests as his or her own. Resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position should be resolved in\nfavor of the government.20\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n Directive, E2.A5.1.1.\n21\n Directive, E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\n22\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities. (Emphasis added)\n Directive, E2.A6.1.1.\n23\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;\n24\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n25\n7\nPersonal Conduct. Under Guideline E, a security concern may arise if it is shown an\napplicant has exhibited questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.  Here, the government questioned\n21\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness by alleging she deliberately falsified her answer to question 20 of her\nSF 85P, wherein she listed one delinquent debt, but omitted the three debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b -\n1.d. (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In response, Applicant denied intentionally omitting her debts from her application\nfor public trust position, and demonstrated the SF 85P reflected her disclosure of the debt in SOR\n\u00b6 1.d, albeit by a different name. \nOn its face, the government\u2019s evidence supports the allegation that Applicant omitted her\ndebts, and Guideline E DC 2  must be considered. However, Applicant demonstrated she lacked the\n22\nintent to falsify or mislead, as required by the plain language of DC 2, when she completed her SF\n85P. Her explanation of how she completed the questionnaire, when taken together with the\ndocumentary evidence she submitted, was both plausible and credible. In light of all of the\ninformation probative of this issue, Applicant\u2019s omission of relevant information was an error, no\ndisqualifying conditions apply, and I conclude Guideline E for Applicant.\nFinancial Considerations. Under Guideline F, an applicant who is financially overextended\nthrough delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may be at risk of engaging in\nillegal acts to generate funds to resolve her fiscal difficulties.  In 1998, Applicant received relief in\n23\nbankruptcy from debts left over from her failed marriage. But she later incurred other delinquent\ndebts in 2002 and 2003. The credit card account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b remains unpaid as Applicant\ndoes not have the funds available to make the lump sum payment the creditor requires. The debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.c also remains unpaid for lack of adequate funds, and because Applicant thought the debt\nwas no longer due after the car dealer re-sold the car. These facts warrant consideration of Guideline\nF disqualifying condition (DC) 1  and DC 3.  \n24\n25\nBy contrast, available information shows the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was paid about a year\nbefore the SOR was issued. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b became delinquent after Applicant lost most of\nher income from 2002 through 2004 because she was disabled and unable to work. The SOR 1.c debt\narose when a car she bought turned out to be a lemon around the time she became disabled. Because\nneither creditor is actively pursuing repayment, the presence of these debts does not appear to be a\n\n Directive, E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control\n26\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).\n Directive, E2.A6.1.3.1. The behavior was not recent.\n27\n See note 17, supra.\n28\n Ax. A.\n29\n8\nsource of pressure that may lead Applicant to do something illegal to generate funds so she can pay\nthem off. Based on all of the foregoing, Guideline F mitigating condition (MC) 3  applies. \n26\nApplicant is also entitled to some benefit under MC1  in that, although two debts remain\n27\nunpaid, she has not experienced any recent financial difficulties. She is meeting her current\nobligations, has a positive cash flow, and appears to live within her means. The government does\nnot inquire about a person\u2019s finances to ensure she is debt free. Rather, this information must be\nviewed in its proper context; namely, to assess whether there is an unacceptable  risk posed by an\napplicant\u2019s financial condition. The presence of unpaid debts, regardless of the amount, does not,\nwithout more, create such a risk. In light of all of the available information probative of this issue,\nI conclude this guideline for the Applicant.\nWhole Person. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have also considered the adjudicative\nprocess factors collectively referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  Applicant is a mature adult,\n28\nwho now has a measure of financial stability for the first time in several years. She also appears to\nbe a productive employee, as shown by a past award for her work.  Although she clearly would like\n29\nto be able to repay her two remaining debts, one of her creditors refused to work with her and the\nother never contacted her about the debt, leading to a reasonable conclusion that the resale of the car\nended the matter. The financial problems that led to her bankruptcy and the two remaining debts no\nlonger exist, and she has taken what steps she can to improve her financial standing so as to avoid\nsimilar problems in the future. As a matter of common sense, the facts presented in this case do not\npose an unacceptable risk to the interests of national security. \n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security to grant Applicant a position of public trust.\nMatthew E.

He has just begun the\n\n By memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence\n1\nand Security directed DOHA to utilize Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 to resolve contractor cases forwarded\nto it for a trustworthiness determination, to include those involving ADP I, II, and III positions.  \n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nprocess of cleaning up his financial house, which includes about $30,000 in delinquent student loans.\nTime will tell if he is able to do so. Eligibility is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) reviewed Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\noccupy an automated data processing (ADP) position designated as an ADP I, II, or III position to\nsupport a contract with the Defense Department.  As a result of the review, the agency recommended\n1\nApplicant\u2019s case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether Applicant is\neligible to occupy such a position. \nActing under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated  January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive), DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on September 22, 2006. The\nSOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis for the action\nand alleges a concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. Under Guideline F, the SOR\nalleges that Applicant has 17 delinquent debts for more than $40,000.\nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005. The revised guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  They apply to\n2\nthis case because (1) the SOR is dated September 22, 2006, and (2) this case qualifies as an other\ndetermination. Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. A copy of the\nrevised guidelines was provided to Applicant along with the SOR. \nApplicant timely replied to the SOR in writing on October 11, 2006. Subsequently, in\nDecember 2006, he indicated he did not wish to have a hearing. \nOn January 25, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant and\nmaterial information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by him on January 31, 2007. Applicant\u2019s reply\nto the FORM is a three-page letter dated February 26, 2007. Department counsel having no\nobjections, it is admitted into the record as Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me March 13, 2007.\n \n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied the indebtedness alleged in subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e,\n1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.l. He admitted the indebtedness in the other 11 subparagraphs, although he\nclaimed the debt in 1.k was the same as the debt in 1.j. His admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. And I make the following findings of fact.\n1.\nApplicant is a 27-year-old customer service representative for a health-care company that\nprovides services to the Defense Department. He has worked in this job since December 2004. His\njob involves having access to unclassified information (for example, names, personal medical\ninformation, etc.). \n2.\nIn conjunction with his employment, Applicant completed a questionnaire for public trust\npositions (Standard Form 85P) in December 2004. In response to Question 20 about his police\nrecord, he disclosed, among other things, a bad check/forgery offense in 2000. In response to\nQuestion 22 about his financial record, he disclosed two accounts, a student loan and a credit card,\nthat were then over 180-days delinquent. \n3.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. As part of the background investigation, a\ncredit report was obtained in July 2005. The public record section of the report revealed one unpaid\ncivil judgment for $51. The trade section of the report revealed two student loans for a total of more\nthan $30,000 where the creditor could not locate the consumer. The remaining five accounts in the\ntrade section were all collection accounts. And the collections section of the report revealed three\naccounts in a collection status. An additional credit report was obtained in August 2006, and this\nreport further revealed or confirmed Applicant\u2019s unfavorable financial history. For example, it\nrevealed two unpaid civil judgments for $51 and $42 and several collection accounts.\n4.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to multiple creditors for nearly $40,000 in total.\nThe total includes about $30,000 for the two student loans as set forth in subparagraphs 1.j and 1.k.\nApplicant has provided written responses about his indebtedness, to include his initial reply to the\nSOR, his December 2006 reply, and answers to interrogatories. In doing so, he has asserted that he\nhas taken various actions. But other than his assertions, he has not provided any documentary\nevidence establishing proof of payment, proof of settlement, proof of a repayment agreement, or\nproof of some step taken to dispute or resolve the debts in question. For example, such proof might\ninclude court records (satisfaction of judgments), receipts, copies of cancelled checks, account\nstatements, bank statements, and correspondence (by mail or e-mail) verifying the status of\ndelinquent accounts or repayment agreements with creditors. \n5.\nConcerning the debts he denies, the available evidence establishes the SOR allegations. For\nexample, subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e, concern unpaid civil judgments for $42 and $51, respectively.\nThese unpaid judgments are established by the August 2006 credit report, and they appear to be\njudgments taken against Applicant by a property management company. Applicant has not provided\ninformation to refute these judgments. \n6.\nSubparagraph 1.g concerns a $146 collection account initially owed to a utility company. It\nis established by the 2005 and 2006 credit reports. Applicant has not provided information to refute\nthis debt.\n\n4\n7.\nSubparagraphs 1.h, 1.i, and 1.l concern collection accounts for $50, $47, and $40,\nrespectively. In his reply to the SOR, Applicant denied the debts and explained that because he\nserved time in jail (due to forgery or bad check charges) instead of paying the debts and that the debts\nshould be cleared on that basis. In his reply to the FORM, Applicant acknowledged that he still owes\nthese debts.  \n8.\nSubparagraphs 1.j and 1.k allege two delinquent student loans for a total of more than\n$30,000. In his reply to the SOR, he claimed this involved a single account. The 2005 credit report\nreveals two student loan accounts with different account numbers, different balances, different past-\ndue amounts, and different dates associated with opening the accounts. Given these circumstances,\nI find these allegations involve two student loans. In addition, he acknowledged in his reply to the\nFORM that he found the paperwork on his student loans and he owes around $30,000. He expects\nto start making payments in June 2007.  \n9.\nBeyond the debts in the SOR, Applicant disclosed in his reply to the FORM that he has tax\nproblems. He contacted the IRS about his taxes for tax year 2004. If his appeal is unsuccessful, he\nexpects to start making payments in June 2007. He has filed returns with the IRS for 2005 and 2006,\nand payment for 2006 was to be made in February 2007. He is waiting for refunds from the state for\ntax years 2005 and 2006 so he can pay his federal taxes for 2005. \n10.\nApplicant believes he has arrived at a budget (which he did not submit) to pay off his debts\nor start to pay by the end of 2007. With his current job and the support of his girlfriend, he believes\nhe can get control of his debts. He knows he is responsible for resolving his financial problems and\nbelieves he is now at a point in his life where he is able to do so. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F, a concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also\nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding sensitive\ninformation.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a concern is raised by significant unpaid\ndebts. Applicant has a history of financial problems. He has delinquent consumer debts plus\ndelinquent student loans for about $30,000. His financial problems include a forgery charge when\nhe forged two checks of a former roommate as well as writing some bad or worthless checks. In\naddition, as volunteered by Applicant, he has tax problems with the IRS. It appears he owed the IRS\nfor tax years 2004, 2005, and 2006 when he replied to the FORM. Viewing the record evidence as\na whole, the following the disqualifying conditions (DC) under Guideline F apply: (1) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; (2) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and (3) deceptive\nor illegal financial practices as evidenced by the forgery and bad check offenses. I have not applied\nthe DC concerning failure to file annual federal income tax returns because Applicant indicated he\nhas now filed his federal and state tax returns. To sum up, the record evidence shows a pattern of\nfinancial immaturity and irresponsibility over a period of years. \n\n5\nI reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. He has\nnot presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial considerations concern. In particular, the\nrecord evidence is insufficient to establish that he has made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise\nresolve his indebtedness. I reach this conclusion primarily because Applicant has not documented\nthe actions (to include payments) he claims he has taken to address his financial problems. In\naddition to the lack of documentation, time will tell if he will follow through and take the necessary\nsteps to clean up his financial house. \nAt this point, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems\u2014which includes forgery of checks\nand passing bad checks as well as $30,000 in delinquent student loans\u2014militates against granting\nhim eligibility for an ADP position. Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant failed to establish it is\nin the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for an ADP I, II, or III position. In reaching\nthis conclusion, I also considered Applicant\u2019s case under the whole-person concept and my whole-\nperson analysis does not support a favorable outcome for Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR Paragraph 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013q :\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I, II, or III position.\nEligibility is denied. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In the past she had six bad check charges over\n12 years, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997 and 2005, and provided information truthfully on her\nSF 85P and to a Government investigator.  Applicant mitigated the financial considerations, personal\nconduct, and criminal conduct trustworthiness concerns.  Eligibility for a public trust position is\ngranted.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On December 26, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n1\n2\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on January 22, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.  On June 27, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness\ndetermination for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were\nadmitted into evidence.  Applicant requested additional time to submit exhibits, and I granted her\nrequest.  The Department had no objection to the admission of those exhibits, and they were\nadmitted into evidence as Exhibits B to D.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 11,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 47 years old, divorced, and has four children.  The two oldest children are in\ntheir twenties, and the two youngest are 16 and 14 years of age.  Applicant works for a defense\ncontractor in the health management business as a claims processor.  Applicant was divorced in May\n2004.  Recently, she has been ill with colon cancer.  She returned to full-time work after being on\nmedical leave for eight months until May 2007, and now works 10 hours daily to earn extra money\nwhen her employer offers overtime opportunities.  Her monthly net income is $1,200, and her\nmonthly expenses for herself and the two minor children living with her are $1,035. (Tr. 42-44, 48,\n52, 59, 68; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant has six arrests for issuing or writing worthless checks, that is, checks for which\nshe had insufficient funds to pay them when the merchant to whom she wrote them tried to collect\non them.  The first charge occurred on March 30, 1992, and  was dismissed the same day after\nApplicant paid the check.  The next check charge was May 4, 1992, and was dismissed in June 1993.\nThe third arrest was April 21, 1997, and Applicant was found guilty, ordered to pay restitution, to\nserve community service, and given one year\u2019s probation.  The fourth arrest was July 15, 2000.  The\nstate court found her guilty, and fined her f $85, and ordered her to pay $550 restitution.  Her fifth\n\n4\narrest was on September 11, 2002, and she was found guilty, fined $208, and ordered to pay\nrestitution and a service charge.  Her final arrest was on August 24, 2004, which was later dismissed.\nShe paid the check.  Applicant claims her former husband and she had a joint checking account, and\nthey failed to inform each other when one of them wrote a check, leading to insufficient money being\nin the account.  After her divorce in 2004, she had a joint checking account with her oldest child, and\nthat situation caused the last insufficient check charge.  Now Applicant has a sole checking account\nfor herself, and no further insufficient check charges have occurred.  Applicant consults with a debt\ncounselor to learn how to better manage her finances. (Tr. 30, 32, 46, 53, 54, 58, 73 74; Exhibits 1,\n3, 4, D)\nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 1997.  She and her husband were discharged\nin bankruptcy in October 1997.  Applicant later filed a new bankruptcy action, a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy, on April 13, 2002.  Her liabilities at that time were $68,641.09.  Applicant does not\nremember what circumstances caused her and her husband to have such debt, but their house was\ndestroyed by fire in 1997, and they did not have insurance.  This amount might include the mortgage\nbalance and various other debts they had at the time.  Applicant failed to make the required payments\nto the trustee and her petition was dismissed.  Next, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy action on June\n18, 2004, with liabilities of $14,078.  The bankruptcy court dismissed this action on November 19,\n2004, after Applicant failed to pay the filing fees.  Finally, she again filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\non April 8, 2005, when her liabilities were $19,150.  This bankruptcy case was discharged on July\n28, 2005, and her liabilities were eliminated. (Tr. 54-56; Exhibits 4, 5)\nApplicant and her family lived in an apartment for a number of years on a month to month\ntenancy.  The monthly rent ultimately was $750.  She had not paid it for several months when she\ndecided to move out.  The landlord sued in small claims court for the rent until he rented the\napartment again.  The settlement amount was $1,297, half to be paid by Applicant and half by her\nformer husband.  The amount has not been paid.  Applicant admitted she has no formal plan to repay\nthe landlord, but she will pay him the money owed when she can afford to do so.  The landlord\nobtained a judgment against Applicant in April 2006.  While this debt remained unpaid, Applicant\nwas able to find $1,500 to finance the eighth grade trip of her youngest child to Washington, D.C.\nHer daughter raised some money by babysitting and fundraisers, but the balance of $1,500 Applicant\npaid for her daughter. (Tr. 41, 42, 53, 56, 77)\nApplicant worked for a glass company as a salesperson before taking her present job.  She\nworked at that job for several months.  On May 3, 2004, she attended a meeting with her supervisor.\nShe claims he made an inappropriate comment about another employee, and she told him to not\nmake such comments.  She told him she could make a sexual harassment complaint.  On Friday, May\n7, 2004, Applicant was terminated from that employment.  The local police went to the glass\ncompany to take a complaint against Applicant on May 18, 2004.  The supervisor alleged that\nApplicant, between July 10, 2003, when she started work there, and May 7, 2004, when terminated,\nstole gift cards valued between $2,000 and $3,000, took $150 from the petty cash fund, and made\n$67.66 in unauthorized credit card purchases.  A criminal complaint was issued on March 9, 2005,\nby the local prosecuting attorney for theft from a business.  Applicant was not arrested by the police\nfor this offense, receiving a summons instead.  Applicant hired an attorney to represent her in that\naction.  On June 20, 2005, this criminal complaint was dismissed on the motion of the county\nprosecutor.  As part of the company\u2019s action against Applicant, her supervisor opposed Applicant\nobtaining unemployment compensation.  The state hearing officer determined Applicant was\n\n5\ndischarged, but the discharge was not for misconduct connected with her employment.  On\nadministrative appeal, the state agency again found Applicant truthfully denied all allegations of\nmisconduct at the May 7, 2004, meeting with her supervisor, and she had not received any warnings\nabout any alleged misconduct from the employer.  The appeal decided on July 27, 2004, held\nApplicant was not discharged for theft, and could receive unemployment benefits.  Applicant\nobtained the compensation in July 2004.  Meanwhile, she filed a sexual harassment charge with the\nstate and federal equal rights commissions.  That complaint was withdrawn in July 2005, when the\nparties reached a settlement that included a $3,000 payment to Applicant.  She later used that money\nto pay some debts and contribute to her oldest daughter\u2019s wedding.  Applicant claimed that she\nthought in her own mind she had \u201cfiled\u201d the sexual harassment charge when she told her supervisor\non May 3, 2004, to cease making inappropriate statements.  She believed she was fired in retaliation\nfor making that statement.  There was no court order that Applicant have no contact with her former\nemployer. (Tr. 18-40, 59, 60, 70, 71; Exhibits 1, A, B, C)\nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) on October 25,\n2004.  She made changes to it on February 18, 2005, at the request of her employer\u2019s personnel\ndepartment.  Applicant answered Question 12 (\u201cYour Employment Record\u201d) by admitting she was\nfired from one job in the previous seven years in May 2004, from the glass company, for filing \u201ca\nsexual harassment claim,\u201d not stating, according to the SOR, that she was fired because of charges\nof theft from a business brought by her employer.  She also answered Question 20 (\u201cYour Police\nRecord\u201d) by admitting she was \u201carrested, charged with, or convicted of\u201d three offenses in the past\nseven years.  She admitted three worthless check offenses in January 2003, February 2001, and May\n2000.  She did not list the theft from a business charge, and the charge on August 24, 2004, for\nissuing a bad check.  In August 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator.  She\ncannot remember exactly what was discussed, but thought she told the investigator about the theft\nfrom a business charge.  The investigator did not tell her he had information from the glass company\nabout the termination of her employment.  Applicant told him she was discharged because of the\nsexual harassment claim.  After the settlement of that case in July 2005, Applicant understood she\nwas not to discuss its terms and conditions.  The SF 85P in Question 20 provides three spaces for\nlisting an applicant\u2019s police record.  It does not advise an applicant to use additional pages, as\nQuestions 9-11 do.  By the time Applicant answered Question 20 in October 2004, the worthless\ncheck charge was dismissed.  The theft charge did not occur until March 2005, and the state\nunemployment compensation hearing officers rendered their findings that Applicant\u2019s discharge by\nthe glass company was not due to misconduct related to her employment.  By August 2005, when\nshe spoke with the Government investigator, that charge was dismissed. (Tr. 35-40; Exhibits 1, B)\nApplicant currently has two credit cards she uses.  One has a $200 limit, the other one a $250\nlimit.  She charges her prescription medicines on them.  She uses them to try to rebuild her credit.\nHer discussions with the debt counselor includes discussions on how to pay these debts to improve\nher credit score. (Tr. 57, 65, 66)\nPOLICIES\n\n6\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from\nbeing eligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\n\n7\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security\nconcern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \u00b618\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \u00b615\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \u00b630\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F: Applicant\u2019s actions causing trustworthiness concerns are that she wrote six bad\nchecks on a joint account with her husband and daughter between 1992 and 2004, that she filed two\nChapter 7 bankruptcies in 1997 and 2005 (she has a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 2002 and a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy in 2004 which were dismissed), that she was charged in 2005 for theft from\na business in 2004 after being discharged by her employer, and she has not paid a judgment from\nApril 2006 obtained by a former landlord.  The Disqualifying Conditions (DC) applicable are\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\n\u00b619.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and \u00b619.d. (deceptive or illegal financial\npractices such as employee theft, check fraud, and expense account fraud).\nApplicant explained the bad check charges as resulting from poor, not intentional or evil,\nfinancial practices with her husband and eldest child with whom she had joint checking accounts.\nThe checkbook was not balanced and Applicant wrote checks without knowing her husband had\nwritten other checks.  The oldest charge was in March 1992, and the last one with her husband was\nin September 2002.  They are not recent.  The 2004 charge was with her daughter on the joint\naccount, and that incident was three years ago.  Now, Applicant has a single account in her name\n\n8\nonly, and the problem has not reoccurred.  All the checks were paid, and the 2004 charge was\ndismissed. \nApplicant had debts she and her husband could not pay in 1997, so they used the Federal\nBankruptcy law to eliminate those debts.  That procedure is a legitimate way to resolve debts.  The\nfilings in 2002 under Chapter 13 was an attempt to pay her debts.  She was divorced in May 2004,\na month before she filed the June 2004, Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  The continuation of that action was\nthe April 2005, Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  These actions were related to her divorce, and were a\nlegitimate procedure to eliminate her debts resulting from that marriage.  She cannot file Chapter 7\nbankruptcy again by law for another five years, at least.  \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is aggravated by being off work due to her colon\ncancer treatments for the eight months prior to May 2007.  Also, her net monthly income is $1,200,\nwhich is about $16,000 annually.  She supports two children and herself.  She does not have the\nmoney at present to pay her former landlord, but commits to paying him in conjunction with her\nformer husband.  She paid or discharged in bankruptcy all her other debts, and I conclude she will\npay this debt as she promised to do.  The money paid to send her daughter on her eighth grade trip\ncould have been used for this purpose, but she exercised her judgment to give her daughter the one-\ntime opportunity to visit the Federal Capital with her classmates.  That decision is an understandable\none by a mother.\nThe remaining allegation in the SOR under this trustworthiness concern is the theft from a\nbusiness charge.  I considered the evidence submitted, and find nothing persuasive to support the\nallegation.  First, Applicant was not arrested in 2003 or in 2004 on this charge.  The criminal\ncomplaint was dismissed in June 2005, three months after the public prosecutor filed it, so the\nprosecutor obviously thought he could not prove the charges.  Applicant was found not to have been\ndischarged for misconduct relating to theft by the state unemployment compensation hearing\nofficers.  Applicant was discharged less than a week after she made a claim of sexual harassment to\nher supervisor.  She later filed a formal complaint with the state and federal agencies that handle\nsuch claims.  It was later settled for $3,000, paid by her employer.  I looked at the evidence attached\nto the criminal complaint and conclude it is hearsay at its worst, not supported by any detailed\nobjective financial analysis of the employer\u2019s allegations, and is so closely linked to Applicant\u2019s\ncharge of sexual harassment to raise the issue that retaliation was a factor in her discharge, not\nfinancial misconduct.\nApplicant also is working with a debt counselor in her town.  She is trying to live within her\nmeans and avoid further financial difficulties as she tries to reestablish her credit.\nThe Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable are \u00b620.a. (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment), \u00b620.b (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances),\n\u00b620.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control), and \u00b620.d (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  Applicant\u2019s divorce,\n\n9\ncancer, discharge in 2004, and subsequent unemployment contributed to her financial problems, all\nfactors beyond her control.  Her  bad check writing situation extended over 12 years, but ended three\nyears ago with her using a single checking account.  She has changed her behavior pattern, and is\nattempting, with the counselor\u2019s help, to reestablish her credit and live within her means. Her\nfinancial situation appears to be under control, as she has taken steps to resolve her debts.\nGuideline E: The personal conduct trustworthiness concern is questionable judgment and\ndishonesty for issuing bad checks and the theft from business charge in 2005.  The second concern\nis the alleged falsification of Applicant\u2019s answers to Questions 12 and 20 on her SF 85P, and the\nalleged omission of material facts during an August 2005 interview with a Government investigator.\nThe theft from the business charge was alleged in the SOR erroneously as having occurred\nin 2003 (it happened in 2004 and 2005), involving an arrest which it did not, and the entry of a court\norder to Applicant not to contact her former employer that does not exist.  The underlying evidence\nand analysis concerning this allegation was discussed under the Financial Considerations guideline.\nThe charge was not founded on persuasive evidence, and resulted from  an effort by her former\nemployer to blame her for misconduct for which she could be terminated.  Applicant did not engage\nin conduct involving questionable judgment or dishonesty in this situation.\nThe series of six worthless checks written between 1992 and 2004 occurred because\nApplicant and her husband could not balance their joint checking account by keeping each other\ninformed as to what checks were written and for what amount.  It was inattentiveness, failure to\ncommunicate, and clerical errors, not willful and deliberate check fraud that caused this series of\nevents.\nThe last group of allegations under this guideline is that Applicant did not answer questions\non her SF 85P honestly.  She answered each question on the form based on the information she knew\nto be true and accurate.  Question 12 regarding her employment history she answered correctly and\nhonestly.  She disclosed she was terminated in May 2004, because she filed a sexual harassment\ncharge against her employer.  The evidence shows that event occurred.  The theft from business\ncharge was created by her employer to justify their action.  The settlement of the sexual harassment\ncharge shows it had a valid basis.  Applicant believed that she was fired because she made an\naccusation of sexual harassment, and the facts support her interpretation and show she provided the\ncorrect answer to Question 12.  Her answer also put the Government on notice that there was a\ntermination situation it needed to investigate more thoroughly.\nQuestion 20 sought all arrests, charges, and convictions in the past seven years.  Applicant\nagain disclosed three bad check arrests.  That disclosure was the honest and correct disclosure.\nWhen she completed the SF 85P in October 2004, and added to it in February 2005, there were no\ncriminal charges concerning the theft pending or on file.  Furthermore, Applicant believed she was\nterminated by that employer because of the sexual harassment charge she made, not any criminal\naction.  That action occurred in March 2005.  The last bad check charge in August 2004, was\ndismissed and Applicant paid the check.  In her mind the matter was resolved without an arrest,\ncharge, or conviction.  Finally, the SF 85P, Question 20, had three blocks into which an employee\nmay enter arrests, etc., and provided no guidance on charges greater in number than three, or\nadditional space for the entry of other information in Question 20.  Applicant completed what she\nwas told to complete.  There was no deliberate falsification in the answers Applicant gave.\n\n10\nOne of the final allegations under this guideline is that Applicant did not disclose to the\nGovernment investigator in August 2005, her \u201carrest in July 2003 for Theft in a Business Setting\u201d\nreferring to subparagraph 1.f. of the SOR.  In fact, there was no such arrest in July 2003, involving\nApplicant, because July 2003, was when she was hired by that employer.  There was no arrest in the\nlist of offenses in Exhibit 2 for that date.  Applicant was not arrested, but merely charged in a\ncriminal complaint in March 2005.  She thinks she told the investigator about the incident, but by\nthen the complaint had been dismissed in June 2005.  She also had the sexual harassment claim\nsettlement in July 2005, which she believed she was  required to keep confidential.  Her explanations\nare credible when examined against the sequence of events, coupled with the full disclosures she\nmade throughout her SF 85P, and the two-year passage of time since her interview.\nOn the first examination of the SOR allegations, it would appear Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Conduct (DC) under \u00b616.a (involving deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, or determine\ntrustworthiness), \u00b616.b (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, or other official government representative), and\n\u00b616.c (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\nadverse determination under any single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not safeguard protected information) apply.  SOR Paragraph 2 interrelates the\nfinancial and job termination allegations in Paragraph 1 as the basis for the deliberate falsification\nand failure to disclose allegations contained in Paragraph 2.\nHowever, I discussed in the Financial Considerations and analysis under this guideline why\nI conclude the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (MC) under this guideline are more\npersuasive.  The disclosures she made, and the changes in her life, make the MC more applicable\nand persuasive than the DC.  Those MC are \u00b617.d (the individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur, and \u00b617.f (the information was unsubstantiated or\nfrom a source of questionable reliability).  Applicant is the only signer on her checking account now,\nhaving changed her behavior and obtained financial counseling.  The bad checks have not occurred\nin the past three years.  She is now divorced and living on her own, which makes the likelihood of\nsimilar problems recurring minimal..  She is innocent of the theft charge made by her former\nemployer, and the charges were unsubstantiated and the reliability of the information from her\nformer employer is suspect.  She did not deliberately falsify her SF 85P answers to Questions 12 and\n20, instead making full disclosures to those questions and all others on the form.\nGuideline J:  The criminal conduct trustworthiness concern is based on Applicant\u2019s alleged\ndeliberate failure to make full disclosures on her SF 85P to Questions 12 and 20, and to the\nGovernment investigator in August 2005 about her July 2003 arrest (that did not occur in fact).\nThese acts are alleged in the SOR to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001, a felony, for knowingly and willfully\nmaking a false statement to any department or agency of the Federal Government. \n\n11\nWere any Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions to be applicable, they would (DC)\n\u00b631.a (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \u00b631.c. (allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted).  But I conclude they are not applicable for the reason Applicant made full disclosure as\nset forth on the SF 85P, and did not knowingly and willfully make a false statement to the\nGovernment.\nThe Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable to this trustworthiness concern\nare \u00b632.c (evidence that the person did not commit the offense), and \u00b631.d (there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, and a good employment record).  I discussed previously under the Personal\nConduct concern my conclusion that Applicant did not deliberately falsify her answers to these same\nquestions.  I conclude also that she did not knowingly and willfully lie to the Government under this\nFederal statute.  She made full disclosure as requested on the SF 85P, and the theft charge was\ndismissed on the motion of the prosecutor as it was not supported by the evidence contained in\nExhibit A from the prosecutor\u2019s office.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\" trustworthiness decision. Directive \u00b62.\n\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable,\nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have\nconsidered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive \u00b62.\nApplicant raised four children, is divorced, and now has cancer.  She had financial difficulties\nin the past, including a fire which destroyed her home in 1997, and has resolved them using the\nFederal bankruptcy law.  She cannot use it again by law for at least five years.  Her bad checks were\nthe result of not paying attention to the constant need to balance her joint checking account with her\nformer husband.  While six incidents occurred over 12 years, she has not had another one in three\nyears now that she has a single checking account solely under her control.  She is innocent of the\ntheft charge because it was an unfounded accusation.  She promises to pay the one outstanding debt\nshe has, a judgment to her former landlord.  Having paid or resolved her other debts, she is likely to\npay this debt.  She obtained financial counseling to help her reestablish her credit and live within her\nmeans.  She is trying to rehabilitate herself financially.  Her recent bout with cancer and her divorce\nadversely affected her ability to repay her debts, but now she has cleared away through bankruptcy\nher old debts and has returned to full-time work.  She has two children remaining under her care\nbecause they are minors.  She told the truth on her SF 85P and discussed her May 2004, termination\nwith the Government investigator.  Applicant is clearly trying to exercise responsibility in her daily\nlife.  Her testimony is credible and persuasive on each of the issues raised, and is supported by the\nfacts.\nTherefore, I conclude the financial considerations trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  I\nconclude the personal conduct trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  Next, I conclude the criminal\nconduct trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  Lastly, the whole person concept I conclude for\nApplicant.\n\n12\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.d: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3.  Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

He abused\nalcohol, committed a sexual battery against his 12-year-old step-daughter, and gave false answers\nto investigators on a security clearance application.  With the passage of five years, he has been\nalcohol free, successfully completed alcohol and family counseling, and has restored the trust of his\n\n2\nwife and step-daughter.  He successfully mitigated the security concerns about criminal conduct,\nsexual behavior, and alcohol consumption.  He failed to mitigate the security concerns about\npersonal conduct.  Clearance is denied.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated February 20, 2002).\n1\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits K through P; Tr. at 63-71.\n2\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 20, 2002, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The Defense Office of Hearings\n1\nand Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required\nby Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on\nAugust 30, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), and Guideline\nG (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official\namendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is\ndated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was dated before September 1, 2006, DOD\npolicy requires that this case proceed under the former guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 25, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 10, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was issued on January 23, 2007 and February 22, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 28,\n2007, and April 4, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue Applicant's security clearance.  The government offered nine exhibits, marked as\nExhibits 1-9.  Applicant offered forty-one exhibits, marked as Exhibits A-OO.  All government\nexhibits were admitted without objection.  The government objected to Applicant's Exhibits A and\nF.  The objections were overruled and the documents admitted.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.)\non April 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 3.a.,\n3.b., 4.b., 4.c., 4.d., and 4.e.  He denied all other allegations in the SOR.  The admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 36-year-old facilities analyst employed by a defense contractor.  He is married\nand has four children.  He is a high school graduate and has 56 credits toward a degree in business\nmanagement.  He served in the Army National Guard for two and one-half years, then spent six years\nactive duty in the United States Army, and has been in the Army Reserve since 1999.  He is currently\nan E-6, human resources sergeant.  He has deployed to Bosnia and Iraq.  Among awards he received\nare Army Achievement Medals, Army Commendation Medal, Joint Service Commendation Medal,\nand a NATO Medal, and he has held a security clearance since at least 1997.2\nCriminal Conduct\n\n4\nApplicant received nonjudicial punishment in May 1994, under Article 15 of the Uniform\nCode of Military Justice for the offense of drunk driving.  He was reprimanded, reduced in grade\nfrom E-4 to E-3, and required to perform extra duty for 45 days.  He was charged with shoplifting\non March 27, 1997.  He was charged with theft under $300 on October 27, 1997.  The charge was\nnolle prosequi.  He was arrested on May 19, 2002, and charged with aggravated sexual battery.  He\nentered a plea to sexual battery, was sentenced to 12 months in jail, suspended for two years\nconditioned on good behavior, taking a polygraph examination, undergoing a substance abuse\nevaluation, and participation in family counseling. \nPersonal Conduct\nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted that he falsified information on ten occasions.  He\nomitted material facts on a security clearance application (SF 86), executed by him on February 20,\n2002, on which he was required to reply to the following question:\n26. Your Police Record - Other Offenses  For this item, report information\nregardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed or otherwise stricken\nfrom the court record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain\nconvictions under the federal controlled substances act for which the court issued an\nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607.  In\nthe last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any\noffense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25?  (Leave out traffic fines of less\nthan $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)\nHe answered \u201cNo\u201d, failing to disclose the shoplifting and theft arrests in 1997.\nDuring the course of several investigation interviews, he falsified answers.  On July 30, 2002,\nApplicant had an interview with a DSS investigator.  During the interview, he falsified information\nabout the sexual abuse of his step-daughter, and his excessive use of alcohol to the point of\nintoxication between 1989 and 2002.  He admitted the drunk driving arrest in the military, but not\nhis shoplifting charge, and initially failed to disclose the sexual abuse of his step daughter and other\nprior criminal history until later in the interview.  \nDuring a 2002 investigation by police of a complaint of sexual molestation, Applicant\nfalsified material facts by stating that he did not recall an incident of alleged sexual abuse, failing\nto disclose that he did recall and had direct knowledge of committing the sexual battery for which\nhe was charged.  During a July 2, 2002, psycho-sexual risk assessment, while he did not deny that\na sexual battery on his step-daughter occurred, he denied having specific knowledge of the offense,\nfailing to disclose that he did recall and had direct knowledge of committing the sexual battery.\nDuring a treatment program from August 2002 to February 2003, he told providers that he had no\nrecollection of a sexual assault on his 12 year old step-daughter, failing to disclose that he did recall\nand did have direct knowledge of committing the sexual battery.  During an April 20, 2004,\ninterview with a consultant, he denied specific knowledge of a sexual battery, although he did not\ndeny that it occurred, failing to disclose that he did recall and did have direct knowledge of\ncommitting the sexual battery.  I find that all of his falsifications were intentional.\nOn March 19, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by DSS investigators.  The following facts\nare taken from that interview:\n\nGovernment Exhibit 2 (Applicant\u2019s Signed Statement, dated March 19, 2004) at 4; Tr. at 173.\n3\nId. at 8.\n4\nTr. at 144-145.\n5\nGovernment Exhibit 2, supra, note 9, at 10; Tr. at 141.\n6\nGovernment Exhibit 2, supra, note 9, at 15.\n7\nTr. at 101.\n8\nId. \n9\n5\n1.\nApplicant told DSS that he last consumed alcohol in May 2002, and that he stopped\nfor no particular reason, failing to admit he quit because of the sexual battery case.3\n2.\nApplicant stated he was returning to duty at his reserve unit in April 2004, at which\ntime he would share with his command the charges and conviction of sexual battery.4\nApplicant did not tell his command about this case until the spring of 2007, three\nyears later after the SOR had been issued.5\n3.\nDuring a polygraph exam, Applicant told the examiner that he recalled the two\nincidents of sexually molesting his stepdaughter, and that he previously had told\nothers that he could not recall because he was ashamed and embarrassed, then at the\nhearing on March 28, 2007, denied he gave those answers. 6\n4.\nApplicant admitted that he was not totally truthful with the DSS interviewor on July\n30, 2002, about his past use of alcohol.7\nSexual Behavior\nIn May 2002, Applicant was charged with aggravated sexual battery of his 12-year-old step-\ndaughter.  He entered a guilty plea to sexual battery.  He was sentenced to 12 months in jail,\nsuspended for two years conditioned on good behavior, and required to undergo a polygraph\nexamination, participate in a substance abuse evaluation, and attend family counseling.   He received\n8\na psycho-sexual risk assessment in July 2002, and received treatment at an adult sex offender\ntreatment program from December 2002 to February 2003, when treatment was suspended due to\nmilitary deployment.  Treatment resumed in March 2004.  He successfully completed all of the\ncourt\u2019s requirements, and was released from probation.9\nAlcohol Consumption\n\nId. at 78.\n10\nId. at 78.\n11\nId. at 90.\n12\n Government Exhibit 7 (Applicant\u2019s Treatment Records, dated February 13, 2003) at 7.\n13\nTr. at 79-81.\n14\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C (Letter of LCSW, dated March 2, 2007) at 1.\n15\nTr. at 188.\n16\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit LL (Employment Application, dated July 21, 2002) at 3.\n17\nApplicant Exhibit A (Reference Letter, dated February 6, 2007) at 1; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B (Reference Letter, dated\n18\nFebruary 8, 2007) at 1.\nTr. at 32-50.\n19\n6\nApplicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1989 to July 2002.   In 1994, while in the Army, he received an Article 15 for drunk\n10\ndriving.  He consumed alcohol prior to the sexual battery in 2002.  He has been alcohol free since\nJuly 2002.   From August 2002 to February 2003, he received treatment from an alcohol and\n11\nchemical dependency program, for a condition diagnosed as alcohol dependency.   He successfully\n12\ncompleted a program and was discharged on February 13, 2003.   As of March 19, 2004, he\n13\nattended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.  He regularly attended AA except during\ndeployments in 2003-2004, and 2004-2005.  He attended sporadically in 2006, because his wife lost\nher job, and he worked a second job to make up her income loss.  She recently obtained employment\nand he has started attending AA again.   He received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed\n14\nmedical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program.  \n15\nWhen first asked by the polygraph examiner whether he remembered the sexual battery\nincident, he initially said \u201cNo.\u201d  After being confronted with the fact that the polygraph indicated\notherwise, that he had not been truthful, he then told the polygraph examiner that he did in fact\nremember the incident.   On his employment application, for his current employer, he listed the\n16\n2002 criminal case as a misdemeanor assault case.   \n17\nOne of applicant\u2019s coworkers, and his facilities security officer, wrote letters of\nrecommendation on his behalf, characterizing him as a trustworthy individual, hard worker, and\ndefinitely a team player.   His best friend testified how Applicant had changed since he stopped\n18\ndrinking, that his relationship with his family has improved, and he has supported Applicant\u2019s efforts\nin staying alcohol free.   He also stated that he knew Applicant was going through alcohol treatment,\n19\nbut what it specifically entailed he did not know.  Yet in a letter of recommendation he knew the\n\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit AA (Reference Letter, dated February 26, 2007) at 1.\n20\nTr. at 46.\n21\nId. at 55.\n22\nTr. part 2 at 5-52.\n23\n7\nname of the treatment facility.   When asked if he actually wrote the letter he stammered and\n20\nstumbled over the answer.   He was not told of the sexual battery case until sometime in 2006.  \n21\n22\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that Applicant and his daughter now have a good relationship, and\nthat she and her husband are communicating better and their relationship has improved.  Although\nshe did not feel he had a severe alcohol problem before the sexual battery, she has seen an enormous\nimprovement in Applicant since he stopped drinking.23\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction\nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the\nDirective.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n24\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates]\n25\nApplicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether\nApplicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July\n6, 2006). \n8\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.   The\n24\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\nclearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).25\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal Conduct\nThe government established its case under Guideline J.  Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nConditions (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged) and E2.A10.1.2.2. (A single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses) apply.  Applicant admitted his criminal conduct, including sexual battery of his step-\ndaughter.   \n\nTr. part 2 at 5-52.\n26\nTr. at 63-198.\n27\n9\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (The criminal behavior was\nnot recent) does apply.  The major incident occurred five years ago and there has been no criminal\nactivity since then.  The false statements on the SF 86 and  to the investigators give rise to the charges\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, occurred in 2002.  They also are not recent.\nAlso, CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) is\napplicable.  Applicant completed all requirements imposed by the court in his 2002 sexual battery\ncase.  His relationship with his wife and step-daughter has improved.  I conclude Guideline J for\nApplicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nConditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) and\nE2.A5.1.2.3. (Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and\nmaterial matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official\nrepresentative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination) apply.\nApplicant admitted he was not truthful in answering questions on his SF 86 and to investigators.\nI do not believe Applicant is subject to coercion, duress, or blackmail because of his conduct.\nHis wife and family know about it and his employer knows a part of it.  What is troubling is the\nappearance to me that Applicant is not willing to disclose the entire truth about his negative behavior.\nHe says he sexually abused his step-daughter, but can\u2019t remember doing it.  He blamed it on alcohol.\nYet his wife did not believe that he had much of an alcohol problem prior to the battery.   He shaded\n26\nthe truth in his DSS interview in July 2002.  There is a pattern of attempting to spin the answers\nthroughout his testimony.   This is problematic because candor with the government about a person\u2019s\n27\nnegatives is the crux of a security clearance determination.  If a person discloses their personal\nadverse information, then he or she is more likely to be trustworthy with confidential or classified\ninformation.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.\nSexual Behavior\nThe government made its case under Guideline D.  Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Conditions\n(SB DC) E2.A4.1.2.1. (Sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been\nprosecuted), E2.A4.1.2.3. (Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress), and E2.A4.1.2.4. (Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which\nreflects lack of discretion or judgment) are all applicable.  Applicant was convicted of sexual battery\ninvolving his 12-year-old step-daughter.  The nature of this crime makes him vulnerable and reflects\nlack of judgment.\nI find that Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions (SB MC) E2.A4.1.3.2. (The behavior was\nnot recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature), E2.A4.1.3.3. (There\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n28\nId.\n29\nId.\n30\n10\nis no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability), and\nE2.A4.1.3.4. (The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress) are all\napplicable.  Applicant completed all required conditions of probation.  There are no other instances\nof sexual impropriety.  He has earned the trust of his step-daughter and wife once again.  He is not\ncapable of being blackmailed over this incident, and I find that he is rehabilitated.  I conclude\nGuideline D for Applicant.\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe government established its case under Guideline G.  The following Guideline G Alcohol\nConsumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) apply: E2.A7.1.2.1. (Alcohol-related incidents away\nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other\ncriminal incidents related to alcohol use), E2.A7.1.2.3. (Diagnosis by a credentialed medical\nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence), E2.A7.1.2.4. (Evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical\nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program), and E2.A7.1.2.5.\n(Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment) all apply.  Applicant\nadmitted alcohol abuse and the charges related to it.  He was also diagnosed as alcohol dependent.\n.\nIn considering mitigation, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC)\nE2.A7.1.3.2. (The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent\nproblem), E2.A7.1.3.3. (Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety), and E2.A7.1.3.4.\n(Following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has successfully\ncompleted inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements, participates\nfrequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, has abstained from\nalcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed\nmedical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program) are applicable.  Applicant has been alcohol free for nearly five years.  He\nsuccessfully attended a treatment program, joined AA, and has not had a drink in nearly 60 months.\nHis wife confirms changes in his behavior since he has remained sober.  His conduct is mitigated and\nI conclude Guideline G for Applicant. \nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable, reliable\n28\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the disqualifying and\n29\nmitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk\nand vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (36), his education, his\n30\nemployment, his military service including two deployments, and what might motivate him to be less\nthan truthful.  Applicant supplied false answers on a security clearance application.  His statements\nto police and DSS investigators shaded the truth.  This raises questions about his reliability, honesty,\n\n11\nand judgment.  I have no doubt Applicant was extremely embarrassed by the sexual battery case.  But\nhe should learn that to hold a security clearance, he must tell the \u201ctruth, the whole truth, and nothing\nbut the truth.\u201d  Parsing words and trying to spin answers to shade the truth raises reasonable and\npersistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the\nrequisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.\nI conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

See also, Ex. 2 (Security Clearance Application,\n1\nsigned April 1, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 2, 2005, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nDecember 11, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a\nsecurity clearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  to Applicant, detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised AG  were provided to Applicant when the SOR\nwas issued. \nIn a sworn, written statement dated January 16, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 26, 2007.\nThe case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on February 28, 2007. Applicant\u2019s attorney\nfiled a Notice of appearance on March 15, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 8, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for May 2, 2007. An Amended Notice of Hearing was issued on April 10,\n2007, correcting Applicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s address. The case was reassigned to me on April 30, 2007.\nThe hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government offered four exhibits, Exs.\n1-4. Applicant offered 10 exhibits (Exs. A-J). All exhibits were admitted into the record without\nobjection. The record was left open through to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. By\nletter dated May 21, 2007, the Government forward an eight-page document received by facsimile\nfrom Applicant. The Government did not object to these documents. The documents have been\nadmitted in the record and marked as Ex. K. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.a-1.e, 1.g-1.i. Those\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining factual allegations.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of\nsame, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 46 years old and has worked as a general foreman for a defense contractor since\n2003. He has been employed by the same defense contractor for the past 27 years. He is divorced and\nhas three daughters, aged 22, 21, and 17. He has had a secret security clearance since October 1980.\nApplicant used marijuana from 1985 until 1986, while possessing a Secret clearance. On\nMarch 28, 1986, at the age of 24, Applicant was charged with (1) possession of marijuana, a felony\nand (2) possession of marijuana with intent to sell and deliver. On July 21, 1986, he was found guilty\nof possession of marijuana with intent to sell and deliver. He was sentenced to four years\nimprisonment, suspended. He was placed on probation for four years and fined approximately $900.\nThe remaining charge was dismissed.\n\nEx. K (Letter from Applicant\u2019s attorney, dated May 16, 2007).\n3\n4\nApplicant executed a SF 86 on April 1, 2004 and March 2, 2005. In response to question 21\non both SF 86s (Your Police Record - Felony Offenses. Have you ever been charged with or\nconvicted of any felony offense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.) For this\nitem, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or\notherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain\nconvictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement\norder under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607), he failed to disclose the felony drug\ncharges for possession of marijuana.\nIn response to question 24 on the SF 86s signed in 2004 and 2005 (Your Police Record -\nAlcohol/Drug Offenses. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to\nalcohol or drugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case\nhas been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement\nis for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued\nan expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607), Applicant failed to\ndisclose the felony drug charges for possession of marijuana.\nIn response to question 28 on the SF 86s signed in 2004 and 2005 (Your Use of Illegal Drugs\nand Drug Activity - Use in Sensitive Positions. Have you EVER illegally used a controlled substance\nwhile employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official, while possessing\na security clearance; or while in a position directly or immediately affecting public safety?),\nApplicant failed to disclose that he used marijuana from 1985 until late 1986, while possessing a\nsecret clearance.\nIn response to question 37 on the SF 86s signed in 2004 and 2005 (Your Financial Record -\nUnpaid Judgments. In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been\npaid?), Applicant failed to disclose that in March 2001, a judgment was entered against him in favor\nof a homeowner\u2019s community for $289. He indicated that this bill belongs to his ex-wife. When they\ndivorced, he agreed to pay the mortgage, utilities, and child support. She was responsible for the\nhomeowner\u2019s fee and it was forgotten about and not paid. She currently owes approximately $130\nto the homeowner\u2019s association, and Applicant promised to pay this in June 2007.\nIn response to question 38 on the SF 86s in 2004 and 2005 (Your Financial Delinquencies -\n180 days. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debts(s)?), Applicant\nfailed to disclose that he had two delinquent debts placed for collection. The debt  for $551 was for\npurchase of a family computer. The other debt was for $472. These two debts were also more than\n90 days delinquent. The $551 debt has been paid in full. The debt for $472 was to be paid in June\n2007.3\nIn response to question 39 on the 2004 SF 86 (Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days. Are\nyou currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?), he failed to disclose the delinquent debts for\n$551 and $472.\n\nTr. 64.\n4\nEx. K (Statement from daughters, dated May 5, 2007).\n5\nEx. K (Letter from Applicant\u2019s attorney, dated May 16, 2007). See also, Ex. K (Letter from Human Resources,\n6\ndated May 20, 2007).\n5\nAt the time of his arrest in 1986, Applicant told his wife what occurred. He did not tell any\nother family member, friend, or his place of employment. In his Answer, he indicated why he did\nnot answer the SF 86s truthfully:\nThese events were nearly twenty years old at the time I executed the application for\na security clearance and was no longer representative of my character. I was trying\nto put my past mistakes behind me and move forward with my life. Nevertheless, I\nshould have disclosed this information. I apologize to the Department for any\nconfusion or misapprehension my lack of candor may have caused, and I ask the\nDepartment to please consider my otherwise 27 years of faithful and loyal service to\nthe United States.\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified at the hearing. He is still a good provider in spite of their divorce.\nShe did claim responsibility for the homeowner\u2019s debt.  Applicant discussed his 1986 conviction\n4\nwith two of his daughters on May 5, 2007.  His oldest daughter is away at college. On May 10, 2007,\n5\nApplicant disclosed his 1986 conviction to his employer, which is the date that Human Resources\nDepartment asked to meet with him. The Human Resources\u2019 representatives indicated \u201cthere would\nbe no problem with respect to his employment because of his failure to disclose the prior conviction\npreviously.\u201d6\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n7\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n9\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n12\nId.\n13\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n14\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n15\n6\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n7\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n8\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n9\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.10\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.11\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n12\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n13\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n14\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n15\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because \u201cconduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \nThe Government has proved a prima facie case as for personal conduct. On July 21, 1986,\nApplicant  was found guilty of possession of marijuana with intent to sell and deliver. He was\nsentenced to four years of imprisonment, of which four years were suspended. He was placed on\nprobation for four years and fined approximately $900. This occurred while he possessed a Secret\n\n6\nclearance. Subsequently, in 2004 and 2005, he completed SF 86s. In response to questions about his\npolice record and use of illegal drugs and drug activity, he failed to disclose his use of marijuana from\n1985 to 1986 while possessing a Secret clearance. Moreover, he failed to disclose on both SF 86s, his\nfelony conviction for possession of marijuana. In response to several questions on the SF 86s regarding\nhis delinquent debts, he failed to acknowledge that he had debts over 90 or 180 days. Thus, Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Conditions \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) and\n\u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that country but\nillegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign\nsecurity or intelligence service or other group) apply.\nApplicant has not used drugs since his 1986 felony drug conviction. Since his conviction, he\nhas been a law-abiding citizen. He was ashamed of using, selling, and being convicted and decided to\nput those incidents behind him and move forward with his life. The only person he confided in was\nhis wife. For 27 years, he continued to work for the same employer and received several promotions\nwith more responsibility, and never said a word about his drug use or conviction. In 2004 and 2005,\nhe executed SF 86s and deliberately failed to disclose his use of marijuana from 1985 to 1986, as well\nas his conviction. For 27 years, Applicant has lived with his secret. He failed to take responsibility for\nhis drug activity and simply failing to self-report will did not make his problem go away. He has failed\nto be truthful to his family, his employer, and the United States. His failure to divulge the truth\nregarding his drug behavior as well as his outstanding and delinquent debts, reflects badly on his\nreliability, trustworthiness, candor, and ability to protect classified information. When he decided not\nto provide truthful answers in his SF 86s, he continued a pattern of dishonesty. By hiding his drug\nactivity, he engaged in behavior, which, if known, could affect his personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing. Moreover, his failure to disclose material facts and his drug use and conviction\nmade him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by others. Applicant waited too long to\nacknowledge the behavior to his employer. I conclude that it is too late for Applicant to get credit for\nacknowledging his bad behavior and lies. Consequently, Mitigating Conditions \u00b6 17(c) (the offense\nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt o the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) and \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or\neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) do not apply. \nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in\nlight of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor or the national\nsecurity. Since his felony drug conviction in 1986, Applicant has led an exemplary life. He has not\nparticipated in any illegal drug activity. He and his wife divorced, and they worked out a child support\npayment between themselves, which he has honored faithfully and provided more financial resources\nthan agreed on when it was necessary. He has excelled at the same job for the past 27 years. Applicant\nis not an honest man. He hid his 1986 conviction from his employer and only self-reported in May\n2007. He cleaned up his financial debts in 2007. In 2007, Applicant finally accepted responsibility for\n\n7\nhis deceptive behavior but it is a little too late. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the potential\nsecurity concerns arising from personal conduct. I find that it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant a clearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT 3 The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to several creditors for 12 delinquent or unpaid debts for about $10,000 in total. In addition, it alleges Applicant gave false answers in response to two questions about her financial record. Concerning the indebtedness, Applicant\u2019s reply to the SOR was mixed, admitting several debts and denying others. Concerning the personal conduct, she denied both falsification allegations. In addition, I make the following findings of fact. 1. Applicant is a 33-year-old woman who works at a shipyard as a radiological control monitor. She is in a trainee status. She has worked in this job since September 2004. She is seeking to obtain a Defense Department security clearance for the first time. 2. Her marital status is never married. She is a college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in biological sciences awarded in 1997. During 1998\u20132003, she was a graduate student in a master\u2019s program studying Oriental Medicine. She did not complete the program or earn a degree. 3. As part of the background investigation for her security clearance, a credit report was obtained in November 2004 (Exhibit 2), and it revealed unfavorable information. For example, the trade section of the report has about nine accounts that were then, or in the past, in a collection status.

The correct case number is 06-15664.\n2\n2\nThe evidence is not sufficient to prove that Applicant made deliberately false statements\nabout her financial record when she completed her security-clearance application.

Her efforts, while\ncommendable, are not sufficient to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern under\nGuideline F for financial considerations. Clearance is denied.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s preliminary decision to deny or revoke her\neligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,1\non July 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its action. The SOR\u2014which is in essence the administrative\ncomplaint\u2014alleges a security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant\ntimely replied to the SOR and  requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on October 16, 2006, and a notice of hearing was issued\nscheduling the case for December 6, 2006. Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing took\nplace as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript on December 15, 2006.2\nPer Applicant\u2019s request, the record was left open until Wednesday, December 27, 2006, to\nallow her to submit additional documentary evidence. She did so in a timely manner and those\nmatters were forwarded to me by department counsel who voiced no objections to Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submission, which consists of a one-page fax cover sheet and eight pages. The nine-page\ndocument is admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B. \nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE   \nBefore the hearing, the government moved to amend the SOR (Appellate Exhibit I). The crux\nof the amendment is to add a second paragraph to the SOR alleging a security concern under\nGuideline E for personal conduct (falsification). The second paragraph contains two allegations that\nApplicant gave false answers to Questions 38 and 39 on her security-clearance application. The\nmotion was explained to Applicant during the hearing and she had no objections to it. Accordingly,\nthe motion to amend the SOR was granted. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to several creditors for 12 delinquent or unpaid\ndebts for about $10,000 in total. In addition, it alleges Applicant gave false answers in response to\ntwo questions about her financial record. Concerning the indebtedness, Applicant\u2019s reply to the SOR\nwas mixed, admitting several debts and denying others. Concerning the personal conduct, she denied\nboth falsification allegations. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.\n1.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old woman who works at a shipyard as a radiological control monitor.\nShe is in a trainee status. She has worked in this job since September 2004. She is seeking to obtain\na Defense Department security clearance for the first time. \n2.\nHer marital status is never married. She is a college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in\nbiological sciences awarded in 1997. During 1998\u20132003, she was a graduate student in a master\u2019s\nprogram studying Oriental Medicine. She did not complete the program or earn a degree.  \n3.\nAs part of the background investigation for her security clearance, a credit report was\nobtained in November 2004 (Exhibit  2), and it revealed unfavorable information. For example, the\ntrade section of the report has about nine accounts that were then, or in the past, in a collection\nstatus. Also, the collection section of the report lists 12 collection accounts, of which 4 accounts\nwere paid to a zero balance. Many of the collection accounts were based on unpaid medical bills.\nTwo additional credit reports were obtained in 2006 (Exhibits 3 and 4), and these reports further\nreveal or confirm Applicant\u2019s unfavorable financial history.\n4.\nThe SOR alleges that she is indebted to creditors for 12 delinquent or unpaid debts for about\n$10,000 in total. To date, most of the debts in the SOR are unpaid or otherwise unresolved. The\ndebts from the SOR are discussed below.\n5.\nThe debts in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b are student loans owed to the same creditor.\nApplicant was past due on each loan in the amounts of $1,922 and $1,111. On about October 30,\n2006, Applicant entered into a repayment plan for these debts wherein she agreed to pay $150 per\nmonth (R. 64; Exhibit B). It appears that the balance for the consolidated loans is now about $52,686\n(Exhibit B at 2). She had made one payment per the plan before the hearing. \n6.\nThe several debts in subparagraphs 1.c\u20131.h are unpaid medical bills that were placed for\ncollection. The debts are owed to the same creditor. In total, Applicant owes about $5,300 to this\ncreditor. On about October 30, 2006, Applicant entered into a repayment plan for these debts\nwherein she agreed to pay $200 per month (R. 62\u201363; Exhibit B at 1). She had made one payment\nper the plan before the hearing. \n7.\nThe debt of $1,641 in subparagraph 1.I is for an account that was placed for collection. In\nreply to the SOR, Applicant denied this debt and explained that she was not aware of it or when she\naccrued it. During the hearing, her position did not change (R. 34\u201336). Based on close review of the\nthree credit reports, it appears this debt is a medical account placed for collection and the balance\nis about $1,525 (Exhibit 2 at 9).\n8.\nThe debt of $124 in subparagraph 1.j is for an account that was placed for collection. In reply\nto the SOR, Applicant denied this debt and explained that she paid it in 2004\u20132005. At the hearing,\n\n4\nshe said that it was a medical bill and she believed that she had paid it, but she did not have proof\nof payment (R. 36).\n9.\nThe debt of $394 in subparagraph 1.k is for a charged-off account. In reply to the SOR,\nApplicant denied this debt and explained that she had never been indebted to this creditor. At the\nhearing, she said that she did not recall this debt, but was unsure about its status. Review of the\nMarch 2004 credit report shows this account was for a credit card account, which became a bad debt\nand was placed for collection (Exhibit 2 at 4). The account was closed when it was charged off. This\ndebt does not appear on the 2006 credit reports. \n10.\nThe debt of $143 in subparagraph 1.l is for an account that was placed for collection. In reply\nto the SOR, Applicant denied this debt and explained that the debt stemmed from a checking account\nthat she closed in 2004. When she sought to open a checking account with her current bank, she\nlearned that she owed this amount due to some outstanding checks that had not cleared before she\nclosed the account. She was required to pay this debt to open a checking account with her current\nbank, and she did so in late 2004 or early 2005. At the hearing, Applicant\u2019s position did not change\n(R. 37\u201339). \n11.\nTo help explain her financial difficulties, Applicant presented a letter from her\npsychotherapist (Exhibit A). Applicant has seen the psychotherapist since March 2006, and she\ncontinues to do so weekly. In the letter, the psychotherapist explained Applicant was referred to her\nby a medical doctor concerned about Applicant\u2019s depression and the impact it was having on her\nfunctioning and health. Also, the letter notes that Applicant has been depressed for several years, has\nbeen in treatment several times, and her depression affects her ability to take care of day-to-day life\nduties. \n12.\nTo obtain a security clearance, Applicant completed submitted a security-clearance\napplication in September 2004 (Exhibit 1). Applicant signed the form and certified that her\nstatements were true, complete, and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief and made in good\nfaith. She also certified that she understood that a knowing and willful false statement on the\napplication could be punished under federal law by a fine or imprisonment or both. \n13.\nIn response to Question 38 addressing financial delinquencies, Applicant replied \u201cYes.\u201d She\nrevealed a student loan with a balance of $46,000 that had been more than 180 days delinquent in\nthe last seven years. In response to Question 39 addressing financial delinquencies, Applicant replied\n\u201cNo.\u201d By answering in the negative, she denied currently having any debts more than 90 days\ndelinquent. She did not disclose any of her other debts in response to Questions 38 and 39 or\nanywhere else on her security-clearance application.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\n\n Directive, Enclosure 2, Item E2.2.1 (setting forth nine factors to consider under the whole-person concept).\n3\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (March 23, 2004) at p. 5.\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n10\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d)\n(citations omitted).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\n5\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.  A person granted access\n3\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n4\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n5\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n6\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n7\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n8\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  And as noted by the Supreme Court in\n10\nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order\n11\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\n\n Directive, Enclosure 2, Attachment 5 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n12\n Directive, Enclosure 2, Attachment 6 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n13\n Directive, Item E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations; Item E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or\n14\nunwillingness to satisfy debts. \n6\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  is always a security concern because it asks the central\n12\nquestion: Does a person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact\nin any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance\nor in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.\nAn omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot\nabout it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported. \nTo prove the falsification allegations, the government offered the security-clearance\napplication and relied on its cross-examination of Applicant. Although substantial evidence is a low\nstandard, the evidence here is insufficient to prove that Applicant made deliberately false statements\nwhen completing her security-clearance application. At the hearing, she explained why she did not\nreport the debts in subparagraphs 1.c\u20131.h and 1.j\u20131.l as called for in her responses to Questions 38\nand 39 (R. 41\u201343). In summary, she explained that she was either unaware of the debt or forgot about\nthe debt, and that she was not trying to mislead, falsify, or be untruthful. Having had a chance to\nlisten to Applicant\u2019s testimony, observe her demeanor, and gauge her sincerity, I found Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation to be credible, and I am not persuaded that her responses to Questions 38 and 39 were\ndeliberately false. Accordingly, Guideline E will be decided for Applicant.\n2.\nThe Financial Considerations Security Concern\nUnder Guideline F,  a security concern typically exists for two different types of\n13\nsituations\u2014significant unpaid debts or unexplained affluence. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet\nfinancial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nHere, based on the record evidence, a security concern is raised by significant unpaid debts.\nApplicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as inability or unwillingness to\npay just debts.  The record evidence shows a pattern of Applicant not fulfilling her financial\n14\nobligations. She just (in October 2006) put a plan in place to address her student loan debt and the\nseveral medical debts owed to the same creditor. So far, she has made one payment to each creditor\nper the plan. \nI reviewed the MCs under the guideline and conclude none apply in her favor. Applicant has\nnot presented sufficient evidence to support application of any MC under the guideline. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems are both recent and ongoing, and they are part of a pattern of conduct as opposed\nto an isolated incident. Her financial problems were not caused by a condition or circumstance\n\n Directive, Item E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n15\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation).\n7\nlargely beyond her control. As Applicant just started a repayment plan with her two chief creditors,\nit is too soon to say that there are clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved or\nare under control. Finally, although she is commended for making some progress, her efforts at this\npoint are not enough to conclude that she has made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve her debts. What\u2019s missing here is a substantial improvement to her financial\nsituation. Lacking a long-term track record of financially-responsible behavior, Applicant is unable\nto overcome her history of significant unpaid debts.  \nI have considered the psychotherapist\u2019s letter in the context of MC 3,  and conclude that\n15\ninformation cuts both ways. On one hand, it may help explain why Applicant had financial problems\nin the past. On the other hand, it is not particularly helpful because her depression is an ongoing\ncondition for which she continues to receive treatment. So long as her depression continues to hinder\nher ability to function in day-to-day activities (e.g., handling her finances), it is possible that her\ndepression will hinder her ability to put her financial house in order.   \nGiven these circumstances, I conclude Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Likewise, she did\nnot meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, I also considered Applicant\u2019s case under the whole-person concept, which a detailed\ndiscussion thereof would not change the outcome of this case.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Grossman, Esquire\nJanuary 31, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 8,\n2004. On February 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on September 12, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nNovember 1, 2007. DOHA initially issued a notice of hearing on November 8, 2007, and\nI convened the hearing as scheduled on November 26, 2007. Because of difficulties\nwith his first attorney, Applicant had engaged a new attorney shortly before the hearing.\nSince his new attorney did not have all of the relevant documents, when he appeared at\nthe first hearing, the case was continued.  A new notice of hearing was issued on\n\n2\nNovember 28, 2007, and I convened the hearing for a second time on Jan 8, 2008. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through G, without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 17, 2008. I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until January 22, 2008, to submit\nadditional matters.  He timely submitted five character letters and three additional letters\nregarding his finances, which have been marked collectively as Exhibit H, and entered\ninto evidence without objection. The record closed on January 22, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e., and he\ndenied 1.b., 2.a., and 2.b. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings\nof fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 44 years old. He is currently married and was married once before,\nand he has two children and one stepchild.  He served in the United States Navy from\n1982 to 2003\nApplicant works for defense contractors, and he seeks a DoD security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 5 allegations regarding financial difficulties under Adjudicative\nGuideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed\nin the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,340.\nApplicant testified that this debt resulted from medical treatment received by his\ndaughter, when she was with his former wife. He had insurance that would have paid\nthis bill, but his former wife never notified him so that he could submit it to the insurance\ncarrier for payment. In 2005 he learned of this bill and submitted it to his insurer, but\nunbeknownst to him it was not resolved. He resubmitted it when he learned it was still\noutstanding, and his insurance company sent him a statement (Exhibit A) establishing\nthat they paid $713.52 on the claim, leaving an outstanding balance of $178.38 that\nApplicant is to pay. While Applicant believed that the insurance company should have\npaid the entire amount, as he was active duty military at the time of the claim, he\nindicated that he would pay the $178.38 once he has ascertained whether it should be\nreimbursed to the health care provider or to the collection agency. In a post hearing\ndocument, (Exhibit H), Applicant submitted a letter from the carrier explaining that there\nhad been some communication problems between the carrier and the health provider,\n\n3\nwhich was the reason for the delay in payment, but at no time was it the fault of\nApplicant. I find that Applicant has acted responsibly and made a good faith attempt to\nresolve this debt, and that this debt is or will be paid shortly.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $71.\nApplicant testified that he was unaware of this debt. He has contacted the creditor three\nor four times, giving them his social security number and his previous home address,\nbut they have no record of this debt. Applicant indicated that he would resolve this debt\nif it could be identified by the creditor. I find that Applicant has acted responsibly and\nmade a good faith attempt to resolve this debt.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $9,784.\nApplicant acknowledged that this had been a debt of his former wife and him, but he\nhas yet to pay this debt. In a post hearing document, (Exhibit H), Applicant submitted a\nletter from the creditor establishing that they would accept a payment of $6,150.29 by\nFebruary 2, 2008, as settlement in full on this debt.   At the hearing, Applicant testified\nthat his current wife has been involved in a workers compensation lawsuit, as she has\nbeen off work since August 2004, from a back injury. They are anticipating a payment\nas this case was set to be heard on January 29, 2008. His wife is also in the process of\nreceiving a lump sum payment of approximately $31,000 as a pension payment from\nher former employer (Exhibit G). Applicant plans to use proceeds from either of these\nsources to settle this debt. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,111.\nApplicant testified that he will begin having $190 deducted each month from his\nretirement account to pay off this debt. Exhibit C establishes that $190.15 will be\ndeducted monthly, beginning February 1, 2008, to pay off this debt.\n1.e.  This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$46,203.83, for past due child support.\nApplicant testified that he had been current on his child support, but in 2004 he\nbecame unable to pay his child support for one year, because he was unemployed, His\nformer wife brought the case to child services. Applicant testified that child support\nservices made a three year miscalculation, and incorrectly assessed him as overdue in\nhis child support payment the amount of $54,000. Together with his former wife he went\nback to child services to explain their error and the case was audited again and\naccording to Applicant, he is now current on his child support, and his requirement is\nthat he pay $1,000 a month.  Exhibit B, a series of documents from Child Support\nServices Department dated October 2, 2007, shows that Applicant has paid a total of\n$79,916 in child support with a total still owing of $2,092.93. Applicant testified that,\nalthough he has only been ordered to pay $1,000 a month, he actually paid $2,000 a\nmonth from October 2004 until November 2007, so that he would pay his child support\nand eliminate his arrearage. I find that Applicant has been responsible with his child\nsupport requirements, and he is now current on his child support. \n \n\n4\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed Security Clearance Application (SCA) which is\nlisted on the SOR as August 26, 2004, but that was actually December 8, 2004, (Exhibit\n1). At the hearing, the SOR was amended to show the corrected date. Question #38\nasks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. The Government alleges that Applicant\nshould have answered \u201cYes\u201d to this question and included the debts listed as 1.b.\nthrough 1.d., in the SOR.\n2.b. Question #39 of the SCA asks,  \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to this question and again listed no debts.\nAgain, the Government alleges that Applicant should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to this\nquestion and included the debts listed as 1.b. through 1.d., in the SOR.\nApplicant averred that through oversight he did not list the debts on the SOR. He\ntestified credibly that he did not intend to mislead the Government in either of the\nquestions he completed on his SCA.\nApplicant cited several factors for his previous financial difficulties. When he left\nthe Navy he was unemployed for a period from January 2003 to February 2004, while\nhe was waiting for his current position to be ratified by the Government. He did pursue\nother employment opportunities during this period of time, but he was unsuccessful. His\ncurrent wife also became disabled and stopped working in August 2004, as discussed\nabove.\nApplicant testified that his current finances are in good order and he does not\nhave any other overdue debts. His wife is planning to go back to work in March 2004,\nand his retirement pay from his service in the Navy will also increase, because his\nformer wife will receive a smaller percentage, as the child care arrearage has been\nresolved. Applicant\u2019s wife will also be receiving child support payments from her former\nhusband. In total, Applicant\u2019s income and his retirement pay, together with his wife\u2019s\npay, and his wife\u2019s child support will allow Applicant to be able to pay all his current and\nfuture bills in a timely manner.\nFinally, Applicant offered into evidence five character letters from individuals who\nknow or have known him in his professional or private life (Exhibit H). One is from a\nBrigadier General and another from a Captain in the United States Air Force. Two\nothers were from Air Force personnel and a fifth letter is from a personal friend, who has\nknown Applicant for more than 25 years.  They all spoke in extremely laudatory terms of\nhis high integrity, reliability, and dedication to his job. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends\nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a\nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the\nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n6\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG  \u00b6 19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was unable to\npay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from Applicant\u2019s loss of employment, the dissolution of his\nmarriage, and the disability and loss of employment of his current spouse.  Applicant\nacted responsibly in continuing to pay his child support as soon as he was able, even\npaying more than was required just to remove the arrearage.  I find this potentially\nmitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nAG \u00b6  20 (d) is also applicable as the evidence is clear that Applicant has\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors and otherwise resolve his\ndebts. \n Applicant is now more financially sound and better prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nGUIDELINE E, PERSONAL CONDUCT\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhile AG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, I find that none apply in this case. As discussed above, Applicant was\n\n7\ncredible in his testimony that he did not knowingly furnish the Government with false or\nincomplete information regarding his finances on questions 38 and 39 of the SCA that\nhe completed. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s reasons for his previous\nfinancial difficulties, his conscientious efforts to resolve his overdue debts, his excellent\neconomic condition today, his long service in the United States Navy, and the positive\nletters of recommendation, I find that the record evidence leaves me without questions\nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the\nwhole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Starting around\n1999, he began to accumulate new delinquent debts, which remained unresolved until after he was\n\n2\nnotified that his security clearance was in jeopardy.  Security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations have not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).  The\nSOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 30, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2007, and heard on April\n18, 2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record open until May 9, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary evidence.  I received his additional evidence on May 8, 2007, and it has been\nadmitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) Q through double I (II), without objection.  DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor.  He has worked for his current\nemployer since January 2003.  He is a temporary employee but aspires to earn a permanent position\n(Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at 3; Tr. 55).  He is a high school graduate and has about 20 college\ncredits.  He currently holds a security clearance (Tr. 9).\nApplicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in September 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1.n).  About\n$30,000 in debts were discharged, most of which were credit card debts (Tr. 50).  He was\nunemployed from September to December 1999 and for an unspecified number of days in July 2002\n(GX 1 at 3).  He worked a series of temporary low-paying jobs insufficient to sustain his lifestyle,\nand he began using credit cards for living expenses (Tr. 56-57).  The SOR alleges 12 delinquent\ndebts totaling about $15,701, some of them dating back to 1999.  In his answer to the SOR and at\nthe hearing, he admitted the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and all the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.\nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant told a security investigator in January 2006 that he did\nnot intend to pay his delinquent debts because of the time elapsed since they were incurred (SOR \u00b6\n1.m).  Applicant admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR, and he commented, \u201cIt is not out\nof the realm of possibilities here to make proper restitution/payment if need be.\u201d\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement on\nSeptember 13, 2006.  It reflects net monthly income of $2,948, expenses of $1,620, no debt\npayments, and a remainder of $1,338 (GX 2 at 5).  His most recent pay vouchers reflect that his net\npay ranges from about $823 to $939 per week, depending on overtime (AX N, O, P).  \n\n4\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified he was \u201cappalled\u201d when he reviewed his credit report.  He\nadmitted having an \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d approach to his financial situation.  He was frightened\nwhen he learned that his clearance was in jeopardy as a result of his financial neglect (Tr. 38).  On\nJanuary 12, 2007, after receiving the SOR, he enrolled in a consumer credit counseling service,\nincluding a debt management program commencing on February 15, 2007 (AX A, B, J, K, L).  He\nno longer has any credit cards.

Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\n\n5\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  Guidelines \u00b6 19(a) applies where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that applies where there is\n\u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of\nwillingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 19(c)\napplies when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 19(e) applies\n\n6\nwhen there is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial\nanalysis.\u201d  All these disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence in this case.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nGuidelines \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 20(a).  Applicant\u2019s delinquencies were recent, frequent, and indicative\nof unreliability and bad judgment.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 20(b).  Both prongs, i.e.,\nconditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.  Applicant\nexperienced short periods of unemployment, but the fundamental causes of his situation were neglect\nand unwillingness to adjust his lifestyle to his income.  He ignored his debts even though he worked\nfor his current employer for more than four years and had funds available.  I conclude this mitigating\ncondition is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 20(c).  This condition is established.\nFinally, security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 20(d).  The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that\nshows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-\n0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Evidence of past irresponsibility is not\nmitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he was frightened into action by the prospect of losing his\nclearance.  His personal financial statement and the relative ease with which he was able to gain\ncontrol of his finances during the four months before the hearing demonstrates that he had the ability\nto resolve his problems long ago.  His inaction until well after he received the SOR dissuades me\nfrom finding good faith.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\n\n7\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent\nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nMany of these factors are addressed above, but a few merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, intelligent, and articulate man with a long history of\nfinancial irresponsibility that did not end until he was confronted with the prospect of losing his\nclearance.  His recent remedial actions have significantly reduced the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.  However, his financial recovery is too short-lived to warrant a conclusion of\nrehabilitation or behavioral changes.  It is too soon to determine the likelihood of recurrence.  \u201cOnly\nwith the passage of time will there be a track record that shows whether a person, through actions and\nconduct, is willing and able to adhere to a stated intention to refrain from acting in a way that the\nperson has acted in the past.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 97-0727, 1998 DOHA LEXIS 302 at *7 (App. Bd. Aug.\n3, 1998). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations, and he has not carried his burden of showing that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: James W. Green, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \n \nOn December 8, 2004, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). On December 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), to Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 9, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On February 14, 2008, DOHA assigned the \nApril 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase to me. A Notice of Hearing issued on February 29, 2008, and the case was heard \non March 19, 2008, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n8 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called four witnesses, and offered \nExhibits (AE) A through G and K into evidence without objection. The record remained \nopen until April 4, 2008, to give Applicant time to submit documentary evidence.  DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on March 28, 2008.  On April 4, 2008, Applicant \nsubmitted additional evidence to which Department Counsel objected. Ruling on said \nobjection is issued below. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n                                                         \nMotion to Amend the SOR \n \n \nOn or about March 5, 2008, Department Counsel filed a Motion to Amend the \nSOR and cross-allege the allegations, contained in subparagraphs 1.b and 1.d of the \nSOR, under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and to delete subparagraph 1.f under \nGuideline G, and incorporate it under Guideline J as subparagraph 1.c. On March 17, \n2008, Applicant objected to the Motion. \n \n \nAfter reviewing the pleadings and hearing arguments at the commencement of \nthe hearing, I granted the Government\u2019s Motion and gave Applicant some time after the \nconclusion of the hearing to submit additional information in response to the Motion. (Tr. \n10). \n \n \nThe Amended SOR adds Paragraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and \nrecites the following allegations: \n \n  \n\u00b6 2.a. That information in Subparagraph 1.b, above. \n \n \n \n\u00b6 2.b. That information in Subparagraph 1.d, above. \n \n \n\u00b6 2.c.

The charge was subsequently reduced \n \nto Attempted Child Endangering, and on or about September 22, 2005, you \n \npleaded guilty and were ordered to pay fine/court costs of approximately \n \n$66.00.  \n \nSubparagraph 1.f is deleted from Paragraph 1, Guideline G, and is incorporated under \nGuideline J. \n \nObjection to Admission of Applicant\u2019s Supplemental Documentary Evidence, \n \n \nOn April 1, 2008, Applicant submitted an Addendum to Response for SOR, and \ntwo attachments that I marked AE L, M and N, respectively.  Department Counsel \nobjected to the admission of AE M and N as irrelevant and not subject to cross-\n\n \n3 \n \n \nexamination. The Government\u2019s objections are noted. Said documents are admitted as \nhaving some relevance, the weight of which will be determined.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g of the SOR. In his Addendum to Response to SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the allegations cross-alleged in the Amended SOR. Both his Answer to the \noriginal SOR and to the Amended SOR offered explanations in support of his request \nfor eligibility for a security clearance. (Answer; AE L). His admissions are incorporated \ninto the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in August 1983. At the \ntime of his honorable discharge in July 1987, he was a Sergeant/Senior Airman (E4). \nHe held a Top Secret Clearance while in the Air Force. In October 1987, he began \nworking as a system administrator and security manager for his current employer, a \nfederal contractor. (Tr. 99). Presently, he is a software engineer. After leaving the Air \nForce, his Top Secret clearance was administratively downgraded to a Secret \nclearance, which he currently holds. During the 25 years that he has held a security \nclearance, he has worked with classified information and never been disciplined for any \nadverse incident involving it. (Tr. 101). He is married and has two children, ages 18 and \n20.  In August 2004, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Sciences. \n(GE 1; 2). \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol at the age of 16 while in high school. (Tr. \n105). During a Substance Abuse Assessment in January 2008, he told the evaluator \nthat in the mid-eighties, he drank 5-6 beers on a daily basis. (AE J at 2).  After leaving \nthe Air Force, he became a \u201chappy hour drinker.\u201d (Tr. 107). He \u201cwould stop off after \nwork for two to three, occasionally four nights a week and have three to four beers, 5:30 \nto 7:00\u201d before driving home. (Id.). He engaged in this pattern of drinking until \nDecember of 2007. (Id.). He never drank more than five beers because he knew that his \nblood alcohol level would go above .08, the legal threshold or point at which he was \nintoxicated and should not drive. (Tr. 156). In January 2008, he decided to stop \nconsuming alcohol after receiving the SOR. (Tr. 130; 160). \n \n \nApplicant has three incidents of criminal conduct in his background. In February \n1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, \nafter leaving work and celebrating with some colleagues the awarding of a new contract. \n(Tr. 108). He refused a Breathalyzer test at the time of the arrest and later pleaded \nguilty to a reduced charge of Reckless Operation, a misdemeanor. The court ordered \nhim to pay $125 in fines and to attend an alcohol program in lieu of serving three days \nin jail. He completed the two-day treatment program as required. No follow-up \ncounseling was recommended to him. (Tr. 168). \n \n \nIn July 2002, Applicant and his wife became embroiled in a heated argument with \ntheir son regarding his performance in summer school. The son had previously been \n\n \n4 \n \n \narrested and charged with arson, resulting in the failure of some semester classes and \nnecessitating his attendance at summer school. At a certain point, the altercation \nbecame physical, and Applicant backhanded his son, striking his face. (Tr. 113).  \nSomeone in the neighborhood called the police, who arrived shortly thereafter.   \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Domestic Violence that was later \nreduced to Attempted Assault, a misdemeanor. Applicant pleaded guilty and was \nsentenced to 90 days in jail, with 89 days suspended.  The court fined him $185, placed \nhim on probation for one year, ordered him to undergo an alcohol assessment, and \nattend an anger management course. (Tr. 116). He underwent the assessment, \nattended the course, and sought counseling over the next three to four months. (Tr. \n117). At the conclusion of the assessment, the evaluator indicated that he would \nrecommend Applicant attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and participate in \noutpatient counseling. However, that recommendation was never formalized in the \nprobationary reports and Applicant did not follow up with either suggestion. (Tr. 118; \n168; Answer).  Applicant admits that he had consumed beer prior to striking his son, but \ndoes not believe it was a contributing factor to the incident. (Tr. 116; 153). He is very \nremorseful and acknowledges losing his temper. (Tr. 115; AE L). That was the first and \nlast time he ever struck his son. (Tr. 115). \n \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with Child Endangering after \nan incident involving his high school age daughter. Upon learning that his daughter, who \nhad been convicted of shoplifting, was regularly skipping school and leaving home at \nnight without permission, he struck her several times with a belt.  A few days later, his \ndaughter left school and was picked up by the police as truant. She told the police that \nher father had abused her, after which, she was sent to live with her grandmother. \nSubsequently, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of Attempted Child Endangering. \nHe was fined $66.00 and his daughter was returned home. (Tr. 127; GE 8).  All charges \nfiled against his wife were dropped. (Tr. 126). He greatly regrets the situation. (Tr. 145).  \nHe had not been drinking when he struck her. (Tr. 122).  \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant made an appointment with a professional clinical \ncounselor, who is also a licensed independent chemical dependency counselor with the \nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP) at work, for a substance abuse assessment. (Tr. \n131). According to the counselor\u2019s final evaluation report, Applicant was consuming \nthree to four beers on a daily basis until January 13, 2008, and admitted that at certain \nsocial gatherings, he could consume up to 12 beers over many hours. Based on his \nevaluation, the counselor diagnosed him as having a \u201cHistory of Alcohol Abuse \u2013\noccasional, with recent early remission.\u201d (AE J). He recommended Applicant remain \nabstinent, \u201ccontinue social support system involvement and continued outpatient \npsychotherapy with frequency of office visits to be reduced to one time per month in the \nnear future.\u201d (Id.). The counselor noted a favorable prognosis, as a consequence of \nApplicant\u2019s recent participation in treatment. (AE I and J).   \n \n \nAlthough Applicant underwent alcohol assessments in 1996 and 2002, he was \nnot diagnosed as having an alcohol dependence or abuse disorder. (Tr. 169). The first \n\n \n5 \n \n \ntime he received a diagnosis of alcoholism was from the EAP counselor in January \n2008. (AE J).   \n \n \nIn March 2008, Applicant sought another voluntary substance abuse assessment \nfrom a clinical psychologist. The psychologist interviewed Applicant for three hours, \nreviewed various documents, and administered four psychological tests. Based on the \ninformation that he gathered, the psychologist opined that he believes that Applicant \n\u201cpossesses a low risk for alcohol abuse\u201d or \u201crelapse behaviors.\u201d (AE H). Although he did \nnot specify in his report a designated medical code for the diagnosis of alcohol abuse or \ndependence, he referred to Applicant\u2019s \u201cpotential future recovery from alcoholic \naddiction.\u201d (AE J at 9). He noted \u201cDenial tends to be a significant problem for most \nalcoholics and [Applicant] appears to recognize his condition, be taking proactive steps \nto address it adequately, and to accept responsibility for his actions. These bode well, \nclinically speaking, for future potential long-term recovery.\u201d (Id.).   \n \n \nWhile testifying, Applicant stated he is \u201cnot an alcoholic.\u201d (Tr. 144). He abuses \nalcohol and knows that it has caused many problems in his life. (Tr. 172-173).  He \nstated that until recently \u201cI never considered myself as a problem drinker, but I think that \nI may have been in some state of denial about that.\u201d (Tr. 132). He realizes that he \u201ccan \nnever drink again.\u201d (Tr. 176). \n \n \nApplicant never went to work after consuming alcohol. (Tr. 130). He has not been \narrested or involved in any criminal conduct since May 2005. (Tr. 154).  In mid-January \n2008, he began attending weekly AA meetings, working with a sponsor, and \nparticipating in a 12-Step program at church. (Tr. 162).  His family\u2019s dynamics have \nimproved and his relationships with his children are much better. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current program manager, who supervises Applicant\u2019s direct \nsupervisor, testified. He has a Secret security clearance. He has known Applicant since \n1988 and interacts with him about three times a week. He has never observed any \nbehavior by Applicant that would give him concern about Applicant\u2019s loyalty or \njudgment. (Tr. 24-32).  \n \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s previous co-workers testified. They worked together about 16 \nyears, before the co-worker retired. He held a Top Secret clearance for a period of \nyears, and then a Secret clearance. Since retiring six years ago, the co-worker has \nmaintained a friendship with Applicant. He is aware of the alcohol security concerns \nregarding Applicant\u2019s clearance.  Over the course of the years that he has known \nApplicant, he has never found any reason to be concerned about Applicant\u2019s \nconsumption of alcohol. (Tr. 45-59). \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s friends testified. He has known Applicant for more than 20 \nyears. He is aware that Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol has raised issues pertaining \nto his security clearance. Although he has observed Applicant consuming beer at social \nevents over the years, he does not recall seeing him inebriated. While watching sports \nevents together on many occasions, he believes Applicant drank six to eight beers over \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe course of the evening, including during a game in the fall of 2007. Applicant \nnormally drank three or four beers during golf games. He has not seen Applicant drink \nany alcohol since January 2008 and is aware of Applicant\u2019s decision to stop drinking. \nHe considers Applicant to be a good father, husband and friend. (Tr. 33-44).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified. They have been married 27 years and have two \nchildren. Their daughter is a senior in high school and their son works at an automobile \nshop, while attending college part-time. She has observed her husband consuming \nalcohol over the years, but does not believe he has an alcohol problem. He normally \ndrank with his friends while watching football games at their houses. She is aware of the \ncriminal incidents in his history, and does not think he would \u201cdrink and drive.\u201d (Tr. 66).  \nShe was present when he was arrested for assaulting their son and was involved in the \naltercation. She does not believe her husband was drinking at the time.  She was \narrested, along with Applicant, after the incident involving their daughter. She believes \nthat her husband is committed to abstinence, recovery and church. (Tr. 60-96). \n \nFive of Applicant\u2019s colleagues submitted letters in support of Applicant, attesting \nto his reliability, integrity and trustworthiness. Several of them have known him for many \nyears. (AE A, B, C, and D).  A senior manager at a competitor\u2019s company, who has \nknown Applicant for more than 17 years, highly recommends that Applicant be \npermitted to maintain his security clearance. (AE F). Applicant\u2019s Pastor also wrote a \nletter of recommendation for him. He verified Applicant\u2019s participation in the church\u2019s \nrecovery program and suggested that he participate in the program for at least two \nyears. (AE K). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. Three are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuse or alcohol dependent; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant has two alcohol-related criminal misdemeanors in his history. In 1996, \nhe was arrested for driving while intoxicated, and in 2002, he was arrested for striking \nhis son during which time he had been drinking. The Government raised a concern \nunder AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant admitted that since he began consuming alcohol, there \nhave been periods of time, up to the fall of 2007, when he drank to excess and to the \npoint of intoxication. That evidence is sufficient to raise the disqualification under AG \u00b6 \n22(c). In March 2008, Applicant was diagnosed by a clinical psychologist, as having an \nalcohol related disorder. That diagnosis triggers the application of AG \u00b6 22(d).1   \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of that disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation.  \nConditions that could mitigate Alcohol Consumption are provided under AG \u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n\u00b6 23(a) does not provide mitigation because Applicant\u2019s excessive \nconsumption of alcohol has been ongoing from the mid-eighties until late 2007. \nHis pattern of drinking over the years does call into question his good judgment. \n\u00b6 23(b) provides some mitigation. Applicant acknowledged his problem with \nalcohol in January 2008 and began taking positive steps to address it. However, \nthere is insufficient evidence, at this time, to establish a pattern of sobriety, also \nrequired under this guideline. Based on his participation in a treatment program \n                                                          \n1 In addition to an evaluation by the clinical psychologist, Applicant submitted a substance abuse \nassessment from a professional clinical counselor, who is also a licensed independent chemical \ndependency counselor. The counselor diagnosed him as having a history of alcohol abuse. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nwith an EAP counselor, who gave him a favorable prognosis due to his \nparticipation, AG \u00b6 23(c) has some application. AG \u00b6 23(d) is not applicable to \nthe facts in this case, because Applicant did not enter a formalized treatment \nprogram, as implied under this guideline. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Based on the evidence, the Government raised a potential concern under \nAG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d Applicant was convicted \nof a misdemeanor in 1996, 2002, and 2005.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. The evidence in this case creates some mitigation under two of them: \u201c(a) \nso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment;\u201d and \u201c(d) there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without the \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last incident of criminal conduct occurred in May 2005, three years \nago, and under circumstances that are not likely to be repeated, given the change in his \nfamily dynamics. In the last several months, Applicant has demonstrated a commitment \nto sobriety and exhibited sincere remorse over his conduct. He continues to maintain a \nstrong employment record and begun participating in his church\u2019s community. All of \nthose actions document evidence of successful rehabilitation.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \n\n \n10 \n \n \na security clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s candid \ntestimony. Applicant is an intelligent and successful 47-year-old man, who has worked \nfor his employer for more than 30 years and has received the support of many \ncolleagues. He has successfully held a security clearance for 25 years, including the \ntime he served in the military. There is no evidence of misconduct in his record since \nMay 2005.  \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol in high school. By the mid-eighties he was \ndrinking excessively and consistently, a pattern that has not essentially varied until \nJanuary 2008. Despite alcohol assessments in 1996 and 2002, after incidents that \narose and involved alcohol, he did not take any steps to modify his routine alcohol \nconsumption, even though one evaluator suggested participation in recovery work. After \nreceiving the SOR in January 2008, he realized that his drinking habits could adversely \naffect his employment and he sought professional help.   \n \nSince seeking assistance, Applicant began regularly attending a church recovery \nprogram and outside AA meetings. His relationships with his family have improved. He \nrecognizes that he \u201cwas in denial\u201d about his alcoholism and the problems it created in \nhis life until he received the SOR.  He expressed a firm commitment to abstinence. He \nhas informed his employer and friends of his problem and the potential effect it may \nhave on his job.  All of these steps represent solid evidence of his decision to change \nhis life. However, his history of alcohol abuse spans more than thirty years, during \nwhich time he engaged in at least three criminal incidents that were indicative of poor \njudgment and a lack of self-control. His evidence of alcohol rehabilitation spans three \nmonths. While he appears dedicated to his recovery program, he has not established a \nsufficient track record of rehabilitation and good judgment, at this time, to persuade me \nthat he has conquered his alcohol related issues.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under criminal conduct, but not those arising \nfrom alcohol consumption.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nDeleted \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She said that the beating will usually go on for more than 20 hits with the belts but she stated that she had\nlost count.\u201d     \nAdministrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed\na timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her application\nof the Guideline G mitigating concerns; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.  \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  \nApplicant is a 47 year old veteran of the United States Air Force.

He admitted drinking\nalcohol to excess to the point of intoxication from 1975 until February 2006.  He admitted using\ncocaine from 1984 until 1990.  He used opiates at least once in 2004.  He was diagnosed at a medical\ntreatment facility as alcohol and cocaine dependent.  He provided false information on his security\nclearance application concerning his use of opiates in 2004.  The provisions of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986\ndenying a security clearance to a person who is a user of or addicted to a controlled substance\napplies.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 6, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 25, 2006.  He admitted the four\nallegations under Guideline G.  He admitted three and denied three of the allegations under\nGuideline H, mainly because he believes he was treated for alcohol abuse, not cocaine abuse, at a\nsubstance abuse medical treatment facility.  He admitted three and denied one of the allegations\nunder Guideline E, mainly concerning the dates of his use of cocaine.  He admitted the allegations\nunder Guideline J.  He provided an explanation for allegations both admitted and denied.  He elected\nto have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on May 30, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on June 19, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.  His response was due July 19, 2007.  As of August 13, 2007, he had not responded.  The\ncase was assigned to me on August 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 42 years old and has been a support technician for a potential defense contractor\nsince 1999.  He is high school graduate and has never been married.   \n1\nApplicant admits he consumed alcohol to excess to the point of intoxication at times from\n1975 until February 2006.  He states that during this time he did not consume alcohol from\nNovember 1998 to June 2001, and during June and July 2004.  He was experiencing health\n\nItem 8 at 3-5.\n2\nItem 2; Item 7.\n3\nItem 2 at 2.\n4\nId.\n5\nItem 2 at 2; Item 6 at 2.\n6\nItem 8 at 6-15.\n7\nItem 2 at 1.\n8\n3\nproblems, and his doctor thought the problems were related to his liver caused by consumption of\nalcohol.  The doctor referred Applicant to a substance abuse medical treatment facility.  He was\nadmitted to an inpatient program and treated for severe alcohol abuse from November 1998 to\nJanuary 1999.  Upon discharge, it was recommended he abstain from the use of alcohol and attend\nalcoholics anonymous meetings.2\nApplicant admitted he was arrested for and pled guilty to possession of marijuana in May\n1989.  He paid a $48 fine.   He admitted he used cocaine from 1984 until March 1989.  He also\n3\nadmitted to using cocaine after March 1989 once or twice.   He denied receiving treatment for\n4\ncocaine dependence from November 1998 to January 1999, and June 2004 until July 2004 at the\nsubstance abuse medical treatment facility.   He stated he enrolled in the substance abuse facility\nbecause of alcohol dependence, not cocaine dependence.  Since the only program at the treatment\nfacility was for chemical abuse, and not specifically alcohol abuse, he enrolled in the program.   \n5\nApplicant admitted he tested positive for opiates in March 2004.  He and other employees\nof his company were on a business trip to Tokyo, Japan.  After completing the job, some of the team\nmembers, including Applicant, drank to excess one night.  Applicant awoke from a coma the next\nday in a Tokyo hospital.  He was informed that opiates were found in his blood system.  He does not\nremember consuming opiates but because of his condition he very well may have done so.  One of\nthis team members died that evening from an overdose of alcohol and opiates. .  He was treated upon\n6\nhis return home from June 2004 to July 2004 at the same substance abuse medical facility used in\nNovember 1998 until January 1999.  The diagnosis was alcohol and cocaine dependency.  He admits\n7\nthat from July 2004 to September 2006, he consumed beer once or twice a month with customers.\nIn his September 25, 2006, response to the SOR, Applicant stated he had not consumed alcohol since\nSeptember 6, 2006, a period of 19 days.8\nApplicant admitted his answers were false when he responded \u201cNO\u201d to question 24 on his\nOctober 29, 2001, and his December 2, 2004, security clearance applications asking if he had ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any offense involving drugs or alcohol.  He did not list his May\n1989 offense for possession of marijuana.  His admission was based on his current knowledge that\nhe was arrested and convicted of the offense of possession of marijuana.  He remembered something\nabout a drug charge.  He checked the court records where he would have been charged and convicted\nbut there was no record of an arrest under his name.  Since there was no record, he did not believe\n\nItem 2 at 1.\n9\nItem 2 at 3.\n10\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n11\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n12\nId.\n13\n4\nhe was charged and convicted and answered the question \u201cNO\u201d.  When questioned again about the\nincident, he checked with the court again and determined he was convicted of a drug offense, but the\ncase was filed using his wrong middle initial name.9\nApplicant denied falsifying  his \u201cNO\u201d answer to question 27 on his October 29, 2001 security\nclearance application, asking if in the last seven years or since the age of 16, has he used any\ncontrolled substance, was false.  He admitted his answer to the same question on the December 2,\n2004, security clearance application was false.  He admitted using cocaine from 1984 until 1989.\nHe was 16 in 1981 and seven years before the signing of the 2001 security clearance application was\n1994.  His use of cocaine from 1984 until 1989 was not within the question\u2019s time line.  Applicant\nadmitted using a controlled substance in March 2004, based on information from treating physicians.\nThis use was within the seven year period for the December 2, 2004, security clearance application.10\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n11\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.12\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access\nto classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each\nguideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the\nDirective \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n13\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\n\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1.1 through E2.2.1.9.\n14\nSee Exec.

The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n15\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.16\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n17\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n18\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n19\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n20\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 21\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises question\nregarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or\ndependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized\n\n6\ndisclosure of classified information.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable  judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, or unwillingness to comply with rules or regulations could indicate that\nthe person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt abut a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nThe government established security concerns for Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) based\non Applicant\u2019s admission he drank alcohol to excess to the point of intoxication from approximately\n1975 until February 2006, and his treatment for and diagnosis of severe alcohol abuse at a medical\ntreatment facility by licensed clinical social workers.  His alcohol consumption raises Alcohol\nConsumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.5 (Habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment).  His treatment and diagnosis for alcohol abuse raises AC\nDC E2.A7.1.2.4 (Evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social\nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program). \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR does not specifically raise any Alcohol Consumption\nMitigating Conditions (AC MC).  However, I considered AC MC E2.A7.1.3.1 (The alcohol related\nincidents do not indicate a pattern); AC MC E2.A7.1.3.2 (The problem occurred a number of years\nago and there is no indication of a recent problem); and AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3 (Positive changes in\nbehavior supportive of sobriety).  Applicant admits he has an alcohol problem.  He admits drinking\nalcohol heavily for over 30 years, and was still drinking alcohol as late as September 25, 2006, when\nhe submitted his answer to the SOR.  Even after being treated for alcohol related health problems and\nillness, he continued to drink alcohol.  On an overseas trip, he drank to excess, almost causing his\ndeath.  There is a definite pattern of excessive alcohol consumption.  Applicant presented no evidence\nof a positive change in behavior supportive of sobriety.  Applicant presents no information confirming\nthat he has not drunk alcohol in the immediate past.  The last correspondence from him was that he\nhad consumed alcohol just before submitting his answer to the SOR.  Without any information to\nconfirm his abstinence from alcohol and attendance at any type of alcohol prevention meetings, there\nis no credible evidence of record to establish positive changes in his behavior supportive of sobriety.\nSince Applicant has not established sufficient positive changes supportive of sobriety, he has not met\nhis burden to mitigate the security concerns for alcohol consumption.  In fact, he continues to consume\nalcohol, which indicates recent alcohol consumption and thus problems.  Applicant has failed to\nmitigate security concerns for his alcohol consumption.\n\nTitle 10, United States Code, Section 986.\n22\n7\nApplicant\u2019s admitted use of cocaine from 1984 to 1990, and admitted use of opiates in March\n2004 raises Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (Any drug abuse), and\nDI DC E.A8.1.2.2 (Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution).  Applicant admitted using cocaine for over 6 years.  He admits he used opiates\nin 2004 because medical personnel found opiates in his system when treating him when he became\ncomatose.  Applicant denies being treated for cocaine abuse in both 1999 and 2004 stating he was\ntreated only for alcohol abuse and not cocaine abuse.  However, there was a diagnosis for cocaine\nabuse so he was treated for that condition.  The government has established the disqualifying\nconditions.\nI have considered all of the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (MC) and determine none\napply.  He admits last using opiates in March 2004 while on a business trip in a foreign country.  His\nuse a little over three years ago after using cocaine for six years shows his use was not aberrational\nbehavior or an isolated event.  MC E2.A8.1.3.1 (The drug involvement was not recent), and MC\nE2.A8.1.3.2 (The drug abuse was an isolated or aberrational event) do not apply.  Applicant presents\nno information to demonstrate any actions to show he will not use drugs in the future.  A statement\nnot to use in the future is not sufficient to establish a demonstrated intent.  He has not presented\ninformation to mitigate the security concern for his use of drugs.\nFederal statute prohibits a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled\nsubstance from being granted a security clearance.  An addict is a person who habitually uses a\nnarcotic so as to endanger the public morals, health, safety or welfare or who is so far addicted to the\nnarcotic he is unable to control his addiction.   The diagnosis from the substance abuse medical\n22\ntreatment facility shows Applicant is cocaine dependent.  He is therefore addicted to the drug and\ncannot be granted a security clearance.\nThe government raises security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) based on\nApplicant\u2019s answers to drug and alcohol use questions on security clearance applications submitted\non October 29, 2001, and December 2, 2004.  Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d to questions 24 and 27 on\nthe applications asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense related to drugs\nor alcohol and if in the last seven years he illegally used any controlled substance.  Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the question concerning arrest or conviction for any offense related to drug or alcohol use\nwas false because of Applicant\u2019s 1989 arrest and conviction for possession of marijuana.   Applicant\nadmitted using cocaine only until 1990.  His negative answer to the question on the October 2001\nsecurity clearance application that he had not used a controlled substance in the last seven years was\ncorrect because it was not within the time line established by the disqualifying condition.  However,\nhe admitted using opiates in March 2004, so his negative response to drug use in the last seven years\non the December 2004 application was not correct.\nApplicant\u2019s false or incomplete information on security clearance application raises Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities).  The security concern under personal conduct is a deliberate action in providing false\n\n8\ninformation to the government with the intent to deceive.  Prior to completing the security clearance\napplication, Applicant remembered something about a drug charge but was not sure of the details or\nthe exact charge.  He checked the court records and found no offense listed for him.  He answered\n\u201cNO\u201d to the questions on the security clearance application pertaining to an offense related to alcohol\nor drugs.  Subsequent checks of court records to respond to the SOR shows his 1989 arrest and\nconviction for possession of marijuana but listed with a different middle initial.  His false answers to\nthe questions concerning his arrest for possession of marijuana on both security clearance applications\nwas not a deliberate attempt to conceal the facts.  His failure to list his use of opiates in 2004 on the\nDecember 2004 application was a deliberate concealment of his use of a controlled substance. \nI considered the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) in relation to the one\ndeliberate false answer and find none apply.  He admitted he provided a false answer to the question.\nPC MC E2.A5.1.3.1 (The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of\njudgment, trustworthiness, or reliability), and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 (The individual made prompt, good-\nfaith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts) do not apply.  I find that\nhe failed to mitigate the security concern raised by his personal conduct.  \nApplicant admits he was arrested and convicted for possession of marijuana in 1989.  He\nadmits he deliberate provided false information on his security clearance application in violation of\na federal criminal statute.  Applicant\u2019s arrests and his deliberate false answer raises Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses).\nI considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.3 (the criminal\nbehavior was not recent); and CC MC E2.A10.1.6 (there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation).\nThe possession of marijuana happened over 26 years ago, but the false statement was provided only\nthree years ago.  His last use of opiates was three years ago which is a continuation of his illegal drug\nuse.  The criminal activities are recent.  Applicant presented no clear evidence of successful\nrehabilitation.  Applicant has not mitigated security concerns for criminal conduct. \nThe determination of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness requires a very careful and full analysis\nof his conduct under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The adjudication of security worthiness is an\nexamination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the\nperson is an acceptable security risk.  I considered Applicant\u2019s admission to a long history of excessive\nuse of alcohol and his medical treatment and diagnosis of alcohol abuse.  I considered his use of\nalcohol and opiates in 2004 in a foreign country to such an extent that he almost lost his life.  I also\nconsidered his deliberate failure to provide correct information on his use of opiates in 2004 on his\nsecurity clearance application.  The allegations in the SOR, taken together with a consideration of the\n\u201cwhole person,\u201d indicate a individual who is not trustworthy or reliable and does not exercise good\njudgment.  Applicant has not mitigated the alcohol consumption, drug involvement, personal conduct,\nor criminal conduct  security concerns.  His past history of exercising poor judgment after drinking\nalcohol and providing false information about his drug use establishes a concern that he may engage\nin conduct that does not safeguard classified information.  Applicant\u2019s conduct indicates he is a\nsecurity risk.  I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations et forth in the SOR, as required by\nSection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are;\nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a..:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from high school in May 2000. He attended a community college and received an associate\u2019s degree in business management in December 2001. He completed his college education and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management in August 2003. He has worked for his current employer since January 2006. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant began experimenting with drugs and alcohol while attending the community college. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted he used marijuana with varying frequency from about July 2000 to March 2005, cocaine with varying frequency from February 2001 to June 2004 and once in June 2005, ecstasy with varying frequency from June 2000 to June 2004 and once in August 2005, gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) with varying frequency from July 2001 to March 2003 and once in February 2005, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) once between June 2001 and November 2001.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on January 23, 2006. On \nJuly 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline H. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive). The revised adjudicative guidelines promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, do not apply because the SOR was issued before September 1, \n2006, the date they became effective within the Department of Defense.  \n  \nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on August 1, 2006; and answered it in an undated \ndocument; and requested determination on the record without a hearing by an \nadministrative judge. DOHA received his response on August 21, 2006. Department \nCounsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on January 29, 2007. On the same \nday, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the government\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on April 5, 2007, \nand he did not respond. The case was assigned to me on January 21, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in May 2000. He attended a community college and received an associate\u2019s \ndegree in business management in December 2001. He completed his college \neducation and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management in August 2003. \nHe has worked for his current employer since January 2006. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance. \n \n \nApplicant began experimenting with drugs and alcohol while attending the \ncommunity college. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted he used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from about July 2000 to March 2005, cocaine with varying frequency \nfrom February 2001 to June 2004 and once in June 2005, ecstasy with varying \nfrequency from June 2000 to June 2004 and once in August 2005, gamma \nhydroxybutyrate (GHB) with varying frequency from July 2001 to March 2003 and once \nin February 2005, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) once between June 2001 and \nNovember 2001. He also admitted illegally using prescription drugs (Xanax, Lortab, and \nValium1) with varying frequency from May 2001 to June 2004 and once in June 2005. In \nhis answer (submitted in August 2006), he declared that he has matured and has not \nused any illegal substances or abused prescription drugs for over a year. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a letter from his manager, who described him as honest, \ntrustworthy, ethical, hard-working, and dedicated. The letter does not indicate whether \nhis manager was aware of his history of drug involvement. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \n                                                          \n1  Xanax is misspelled as \u201cXantax\u201d and Lortab is misspelled as \u201cLoritab\u201d in the SOR. \n\n \n3\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied \nin conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531.  \n \n\n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used the following drugs with varying frequency: \nmarijuana from July 2000 to March 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); cocaine from February 2001 to \nJune 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); ecstasy from June 2000 to August 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and \ngamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) from July 2001 to February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). It alleges \nhe used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) once between June 2001 and November 2001 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). It also alleges he illegally used prescription drugs (Xanax, Lortab, and \nValium) with varying frequency from May 2001 to June 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n \n Under Guideline H, improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions \nregarding an applicant=s willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug \nabuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk \nof an unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Directive & E2.A8.1.1. Any illegal \nuse of a controlled substance can raise a security concern and may be a disqualifying \ncondition (DC 1). Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.2.1. Illegal drug possession also is a disqualifying \ncondition (DC 2). Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.2.2. Applicant\u2019s admitted use of illegal drugs and \nabuse of prescription drugs raises DC 1 and DC 2, shifting the burden to him to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \nSecurity concerns based on possession and use of illegal drugs or illegal use of \ncontrolled substances can be mitigated by showing that it was not recent. (MC 1) \nDirective \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.1. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is \nArecent.@ The determination must be based Aon a careful evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows \nAa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last admitted drug abuse was in August 2005, about four months \nbefore submitting his security clearance application. In August 2006, he responded to \nthe SOR and asserted that he had abstained from drugs for about a year at that time. \nSince he did not respond to the FORM, there is no evidence in the record to support a \nfinding of continued abstinence. In the context of five years of regular drug abuse, a one \nyear period of abstinence is not sufficient to establish MC 1. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing the \ndrug involvement was \u201can isolated or aberrational event.\u201d (MC 2) Directive \u00b6 \nE2.A8.1.3.2. This mitigating condition is not established because of Applicant\u2019s \nrepeated abuses of multiple drugs during a five-year period. \n \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any \ndrugs in the future.\u201d (MC 3) Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.3. Applicant has changed his \nenvironment by gaining employment with a defense contractor, but there is no evidence \n\n \n5\nshowing whether he continues to associate with drug users and no evidence of \nabstinence after August 2006. Thus, I conclude MC 3 is not established. \n \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated by \u201csatisfactory completion of a drug \nprogram, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of \nabuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional.\u201d (MC 4) \nDirective \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.4. This mitigating condition is not established because there is no \nevidence Applicant has sought or obtained treatment for drug abuse. \n \nWhole Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed in Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole person analysis. Some of \nthe factors in Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1 were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse began shortly after he graduated from high school and \ncontinued for two years after he graduated from college. His last admitted drug abuse \nwas only four months before he began his current employment. Although he asserted in \nhis answer to the SOR that he was a changed person, the record is silent regarding his \nlife after August 2006, primarily because he did not respond to the FORM. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n6\nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Throughout the decision this letter will be referred to as the \u201cform letter.\u201d\n2\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue an ADP\nI/II/III position for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan.\n2, 1992), as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 29,\n2006, detailing the basis for its decision\u2013concerns raised under Guideline F (financial considerations)\nand Guideline E (personal conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29,\n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 16, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 13, 2007. With the consent\nof the parties, I convened a hearing on April 17, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP\nI/II/III position. Department Counsel offered five exhibits that were marked GE 1-5 and admitted\nwithout objections. Applicant offered two exhibits that were marked AE A and B and were admitted\nwithout objections. The record was left open so Applicant could provide additional documents. She\ndid so timely and the document was marked as AE C and admitted without objections. DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 49 years old and has worked for a medical contractor for the federal government\nfor approximately two and half years. She is not married and has a child who lives with the father\nand for whom she pays child support. Prior to this period she worked as a medical officer supervisor\nfrom May 2002 to October 2004. She lived in a different state for several years prior to then. She has\nhad two periods of unemployment since 1996.  One period was for two months when she moved to\n1\na different state in 2001, and the other was for two months prior to accepting employment with her\npresent employer. She has earned an associate\u2019s degree in applied science.\nApplicant has numerous unpaid delinquent debts. They are listed below with their\npresent status and pertinent information.\nApplicant sent a form letter to her creditors on October 24  and 25 , 2006.  In the letter she\nth\nth\n2\nadvises the creditor that she is attempting to develop a realistic repayment plan. In each letter she\nmakes a proposal to pay a nominal amount on the account or in some letters makes no proposal at\nall and leaves that part of the form blank. She asks that they respond in writing and advises them if\nshe does not hear from them within two weeks she will assume the offer is accepted and she will\nstart paying the proposed amount. She advises them not to call her at work or at home. On some of\nthe letters she provides a handwritten address, on others she does not provide any address or means\nto contact her. Applicant did not provide any evidence that once the two weeks had expired that she\nstarted to make payments on the accounts.\n\nTr. 38.\n3\nTr. 39\n4\nTr. 40.\n5\nTr. 41.\n6\nTr. 47.\n7\nTr. 45-48.\n8\nTr. 48.\n9\nTr. 43.\n10\nTr. 49-51.\n11\nTr. 52.\n12\n4\nSOR 1. a is a phone bill she did not pay when she moved.  It was sent to collection in\n3\nDecember 2000. She claimed she sent a small payment in November 2006. She did not provide\ndocumentation. She mailed the form letter in October 2006, but has not received a response. She\ncontinues to receive statements from the collection company that has taken over the debt. 4\nSOR 1. b is for a credit card that went to collection in October 2001. Other than sending the\nform letter she has not taken any action on the account and it remains unpaid.  \n5\nSOR 1.c is a medical debt that was incurred for an air ambulance that was needed when\nApplicant and her daughter were in a car accident in 1999.  She received a monetary settlement from\n6\nthe insurance company to pay her medical bills.  The settlement was a total of $16,000. Of that,\n7\n$10,000 went to her daughter and the remaining $6,000 was to be used for Applicant\u2019s medical\nbills. Applicant did not use the money to pay her medical bills and the debt remains delinquent. She\n8\nstated she used the money to care for her mother.  She is attempting to include this debt in a debt\n9\nconsolidation plan, but the plan is still being devised. Applicant\u2019s testimony about this debt was very\nevasive and not forthcoming. She originally stated she was unaware she owed this debt until she was\nconfronted by an investigator,  but she clearly stated later in her testimony that she received an\n10\ninsurance settlement check to pay the bill, but chose to use it for other purposes. I find Applicant\nintentionally was misleading in her testimony.\nSOR 1.d is a debt for a broken lease. Applicant\u2019s lease ran from September 2001 to August\n2002. She left after four months because her mother was ill and she decided to move in with her and\nhelp her. She forfeited her one month\u2019s rent security deposit and owed rent for the remaining seven\nmonths.  Applicant did not contact the creditor prior to October 2006 when she sent the form\n11\nletter.  No payments have been made on this debt. \n12\n\nTr. 53-55.\n13\nTr. 60.\n14\nTr. 61.\n15\nTr. 62.\n16\nTr. 62.\n17\nTr. 64.\n18\nId.\n19\nTr. 65.\n20\nTr. 66.\n21\n5\nThe debt in SOR 1.e, Applicant denies. She stated she did not recognize the creditor. She\nstated she attempted to find the creditor on the internet. She did not use the contact number that is\nlisted on the credit report.  She also sent this creditor the form letter. It remains unpaid. \n13\nSOR 1.f is a medical debt. Applicant stated she was unfamiliar with the creditor. She did not\ncontact the creditor prior to sending her form letter. The account was placed for collection in\nSeptember 2004. The debt remains unpaid. \nSOR 1.g is a magazine catalog creditor. Applicant ordered merchandise in November 2004.\nNo payment was ever made on this account. She stated she did not have the money to pay this\ncreditor, but thought she did when she made the purchase.  \n14\nSOR 1.h is a credit card debt. The account was opened in July 2005.  The credit limit was\n15\n$500 and she maximized the limit in the first month. Applicant does not recall what she bought. The\n16\nlast activity on the account was one month after it was opened. She does not recall if she made any\npayments on the account, but did not think she did.  She sent this creditor the form letter. \n17\nSOR 1.i is a credit card account. Applicant could not recall the exact year she opened the\naccount, but thought it was in the last two to three years.   The account was sent to collection in\n18\nSeptember 2005. She believed she may have made several $30 payments over a six month period.19\nShe sent them the form letter, but has not made any other payments nor did she make any other\ncontact with them prior to her form letter.20\nSOR 1.j was a personal loan that she obtained in July 2005, and it was placed in collection\nin October 2005.

She never did. Applicant\nstated she intended on including the debt in SOR 1.l in a repayment plan with a debt consolidator.22\nThe plan has not been accepted by the creditor.  \n23\nSOR 1.m is a telephone bill that was incurred in 2005 and remains unpaid.  Her service was\n24\ndiscontinued due to her failure to pay the bill. \nSOR 1.n is a debt that Applicant did not recognize and she is not sure who is the original\ncreditor, but admitted the debt.  It remains unpaid. \n25\nSOR 1.o is a medical debt for emergency room services incurred in 2005. Applicant agrees\nshe owes it and the debt remains unpaid.  \n26\nApplicant is unsure of the original creditor in SOR 1.p and has not pursued it. It remains\nunpaid.  \n27\nSOR 1.q is a credit card debt that is in collection status. Applicant believes the account was\nopened in the last two to three years. After she opened the account she did not make any payments\non it.28\nApplicant broke her lease and incurred additional expenses when her mother became ill and\nshe returned home to assist her.  She lived with her mother and assisted with her mother\u2019s living\n29\nexpenses. This occurred from approximately 2002-2003. Applicant went through a child custody\ndispute in 2002, and pays child support through garnishment to the father of the child.\nApplicant was receiving back child support from 1996-2006 from the father of her oldest\nchild, who was born with a disability and has been deceased since 1996.  She received the support\n30\nthrough a garnishment order to the father\u2019s employer. The support was for $200 a month. She no\nlonger receives the support, but believes she is owed more money.\n\nTr. 84-87.\n31\nTr. 87-88.\n32\nTr. 88.\n33\nTr. 89.\n34\nTr. 96, 99.\n35\nTr. 97.\n36\nTr. 97.\n37\nTr. 80-81. The debts for the broken lease is listed in GE 5 at page 2. Another debt also listed in GE 5 was for\n38\nmedical services. The broken lease debt is for her failure to pay her rent for two months and she left before she was\nevicted. The rent was for $625 per month. The lease was from May 2006 to April 2007. She moved out in October 2006.\nShe could not identify the other debt for $57. Neither debt has been paid. I have not considered the debts for\ndisqualifying purposes, but have considered them when analyzing the \u201cwhole person\u201d and Applicant\u2019s ability and\nwillingness to repay her delinquent debts. \nTr. 105-107. These debts are not considered for disqualifying purposes, but are considered when analyzing\n39\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d and Applicant\u2019s financial history.\nTr. 102-103.\n40\nTr. 108.\n41\n7\nApplicant owes $22,000 in student loans. She attended school from 1991-1993. She made\nsome monthly payments in 1994, but stopped for a period of time.  She could not provide the\n31\nspecifics of when she made payments, when she stopped, and when and if she resumed.  She has\n32\nnot made any payments in at least the last five years, but really could not pinpoint when she last\nmade a payment.  She stated in the last six months that she consolidated her student loans and will\n33\nstart paying $153 in July.  Her student loan debt was the only one she listed on her public trust\n34\nquestionnaire submitted on November 28, 2004, that required her to list if she had any debts over\n180 days delinquent. She did not list any of her other delinquent debts. Applicant claimed she\nmisunderstood the question and thought she only had to provide information on delinquent loans.\nShe also stated it did not occur to her to list her other debts.  She stated she did not know she was\n35\nfilling out a public trust questionnaire. She stated \u201cI just thought it was a credit background check,\nlike a lot of employers do.\u201d  She stated she did not know that the information would be used for a\n36\nbackground investigation.  I find her testimony was not credible.\n37\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income is approximately $1,550. Applicant provided a list of her\nmonthly expenses which totaled at a minimum $1,510. She lives with a friend and does not pay rent.\nShe has three other debts that are not part of the SOR, one is for an apartment she broke the lease\non and owes approximately $6,000,  one is a phone bill for $207, and another is an electric bill for\n38\n$142.  She has not paid these bills. She also has a credit card she opened in November or December\n39\nof 2006.She owes approximately $300, but it is not delinquent.  \n40\nApplicant contacted a debt consolidation company on April 5, 2007.  She stated she\n41\ncoordinated with them to propose a payment plan that included the debts listed in SOR 1.l and 1.c,\n\nTr.108-109.\n42\nAE A.\n43\nDepartment of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R (Regulation) \u00b6 C2.1.2.\n44\nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n45\nRegulation \u00b6 C3.1.2.2.\n46\n8\nbut does not know if they have contacted these creditors nor is there any confirmation that the\ncreditors agree to a plan.  Applicant\u2019s proposal is to pay $143 a month to the debt consolidation\n42\ncompany for these two debts. She has made one payment to the consolidation company, but does not\nknow if any payments have been made to the two listed creditors. \nCurrently, based on Applicant\u2019s details of her monthly living expenses, she spends close to\nwhat she earns. She does not have enough money to make the payments in her payment plan and she\nwill increase that shortfall in July when she must start repaying her student loans. No information\nwas provided on how Applicant intends on meeting her monthly payments in her proposed payment\nplan and student loan payment. None of her other debts are included in the proposed plan nor is she\nmaking any payments on them. \nApplicant provided a character letter from a coworker who believe Applicant has the \u201cutmost\nrespect\u201d for the policies of her company. Her coworker stated, \u201c[s]he has always demonstrated\nintegrity and trustworthiness whether it is with co-workers, beneficiaries or providers.\u201d  She is\n43\nconsidered an asset.\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines are used to make ADP trustworthiness determinations.\nDepartment of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the\nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.\nAn individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security\nauthority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to do so.  Positions\n44\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n45\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed to apply the due process provisions\n46\nof the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II, and including ADP III\npositions by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and\nSecurity) dated November 19, 2004. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases. \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\n\nRegulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1.\n47\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n48\nRegulation Appendix 8 at 132.\n49\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd.

Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the adjudicative procedures contained in the Directive.48\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Each eligibility\n49\ndetermination  must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Regulation.\nSpecifically these are: the nature, extend, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of\nparticipation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition\nor factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n50\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n51\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n52\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n53\ndecision.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\n54\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n55\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n56\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\n\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n57\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n58\n10\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n57\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n58\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has many debts that have been delinquent for years with\nno action toward paying them. In October 2006, she sent a form letter to many of them, but did not\nfollow up on her proposal. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions that\n\n11\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the person received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant has many delinquent debts. She has taken little or no action to resolve these debts.\nShe continues to use credit cards. Based on her income and the amount of debts she has it is unlikely\nshe will make significant progress to resolve the debts. In October 2006, she sent form letters to her\ncreditors. She never followed up with them. She said if she did not hear from them within two weeks\nshe would start repaying the debt at the amount she proposed. She did not offer any evidence that she\nbegan paying any of these debts. She did contact a debt consolidation company shortly before her\nhearing to work out a consolidation repayment plan. This plan only included two debts, had not been\napproved by the creditors, and she made only one payment. She was not aware if the creditors had\neven been paid. I find FC 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant had some intervening events in her life that were beyond her control. She was in\na car accident, her mother became ill and she assisted her, and she was in a custody dispute over her\ndaughter. She did receive a financial settlement to repay her medical debts from her car accident , but\nshe did not use the money to do so. This condition was within her control. She broke her lease and\nwent to live with her mother and help her with expenses. Applicant could have handled this more\nresponsibly, but did not. Her custody dispute was unforeseeable. Under the circumstances these\nevents were beyond her control. I find FC MC 20(b) applies. \nApplicant sought debt consolidation counseling in early April 2007, shortly before her\nhearing. She also sent a form letter to creditors advising them of her intentions regarding her\ndelinquent debts. Applicant did little else in the past seven years regarding repaying her debts. She\nwas provided settlement money to repay her hospital bills, but did not use it for that purpose. She\nopened credit card accounts, bought merchandise and then shortly thereafter let the account go unpaid.\nShe has broken more than one lease, leaving unpaid rent, utilities, and phone bills, without resolving\nthem. She has not taken the time on some debts to find out who the creditor is and contact them in\na responsible manner. She continues to make irresponsible financial decisions. Her form letter is a\nweak attempt at best to resolve her debts and is years too late. Applicant continues her pattern of\nacquiring debts and not repaying them. I find there is no indication that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems are being resolved. She has a pattern of not paying her bills and continued to do so as\nevidenced by her recent delinquent debts that are not part of the SOR. Applicant continues to make\nirresponsible financial decisions and has failed to show she is making a legitimate good faith effort\nto repay her creditors and resolve her delinquent debts. Therefore, I find FC MC 20(c) and (d) do not\napply.\nBased on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies. Applicant intentionally failed to list all\nof her debts on her public trust questionnaire. Applicant\u2019s explanation and testimony for why she did\n\n12\nnot divulge her delinquent debts was not credible. Even if she was to be believed that she thought the\ndocument was just a credit check by an employer, she failed to explain why she would not have listed\nall of her delinquencies as requested, so a proper credit check could be conducted. Applicant has an\nextraordinary amount of delinquent debts and it is simply not believable that she thought she only had\nto list her delinquent student loan. \nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC ) and especially\nconsidered PC MC 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) and PC MC 17(e) (the individual\nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress).\nI find neither applies. Applicant\u2019s testimony at her hearing was not credible and not believable. No\nevidence was provided to show Applicant made a good faith effort to correct her omission and\nfalsification before being confronted. She failed to offer any positive steps she has taken to reduce\nor eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I find neither of the above\nmitigating conditions apply.\nThe Whole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. I considered Applicant\u2019s age and her work performance. I also\nconsidered that the only action Applicant had taken on most of her debts was to send a form letter in\nOctober 2006. She has started to work with a debt consolidator, but most of her debts are not included\nin the proposed program that has not been approved by any creditors. Many of her debts are old and\nshe continued to incur additional debts by failing to pay her rent, phone and utilities. She has a history\nof incurring debts and then not paying. It does not appear that pattern has changed. I also considered\nApplicant\u2019s testimony regarding her failure to include almost of all of her debts on her public trust\nquestionnaire. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by the\nfinancial considerations under Guideline F, and personal conduct, under Guideline E. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n13\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position. Eligibility\nis denied.\nCarol G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

ROSS\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant\u2019s debt problems occurred between 2000 and 2004.  During that period, he had\nwork and family issues that caused him to fall behind on some of his debts.  Of the debts listed in\nthe SOR, seven have been paid off, two are duplicates of paid debts, and four others he denies and\ndisputes.  He has satisfactorily resolved his past due indebtedness, and evinces a credible intent not\nto have similar debt problems in the future.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 13, 2006, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to an Administrative Judge on April 23, 2007.  The case was\nassigned to a second Administrative Judge on May 1, 2007, and reassigned to me on June 11, 2007.\nA Notice of Hearing was issued on July 19, 2007.\nA hearing was held on August 7, 2007, at which the Government presented seven\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted three exhibits.\nThe transcript was received on August 20, 2007.  The record in this case closed on September 4,\n2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 56, married and has a Bachelor\u2019s degree.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as an Engineer, and he seeks to retain a Secret-level DoD security clearance previously\ngranted in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based\nupon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are\nentered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer\nto the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial concerns).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to obtain funds.\nThe majority of the Applicant\u2019s past due debts were incurred during the period from 2000\nthrough early 2004.  During that time the Applicant worked for five different companies, as well as\nhaving several short periods of unemployment.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 6.)  The\nApplicant and his family lived in several different locations, and states, during the same period.\n(Government Exhibit 1 at question 4.)  The Applicant also traveled extensively during this period\non projects related to his work.  He was not always reimbursed in a timely fashion by his employer\nfor his expenses related to travel.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 2.)  All of these facts had an impact on\nhis ability to know and handle his debts.  (Transcript at 79-82.)\nTurning to the specific debts mentioned in the SOR:\n\n3\n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits owing a past due debt to a utility in the amount of $252.70.\nThis debt was paid in full as of August 3, 2007.  (Transcript at 42-45, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 2.)\n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits owing a past due debt to a property management company in\nthe amount of $2,463.00.  An agreement was reached with the creditor and the debt was settled on\nApril 2, 2007, by means of a payment of $1,231.50.  (Transcript at 45-46, Government Exhibit 7 at\n1, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 2.)\n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits owing a past due debt to Dish Network in the amount of\n$60.00.  This debt was paid in full as of August 3, 2007.  (Transcript at 46-47, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nB at 3.)\n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits owing a past due medical debt in the amount of $182.00.  This\ndebt was paid in full as of August 7, 2007.  (Transcript at 47-49, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 3.)\n1.e.\nThe Applicant admits owing a past due credit card debt to Capital One Bank in the\namount of $1,238.00.  This debt was paid in full as of June 11, 2007.  (Transcript at 49-52,\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 4.)\n1.f.\nThe Applicant admits owing a past due debt to a utility in the amount of $271.00.\nThis debt was paid in full as of February 17, 2007.  (Transcript at 52-54, Government Exhibit 7 at\n2, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 5.)\n1.g.\nThe Applicant has consistently denied owing a past due debt to Portfolio in the\namount of $671.00.  He testified that, using the contact information found on page 9 of Government\nExhibit 4, he contacted Portfolio.  The company informed the Applicant that they had no knowledge\nof any current debt owing to them.   (Transcript at 54-56.)\n1.h.\nThe Applicant admits owing a past due credit card debt to S & P Capital in the\namount of $923.00.  An agreement was reached with the creditor and the debt was settled on August\n1, 2007, by means of a payment of $709.00.  (Transcript at 56-57, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 6.)\n1.i.\nThe available evidence indicates that this debt to Citifinancial is the same as that set\nforth in 1.h., above.  The Government\u2019s exhibits show these two creditors being owed the same\namount of money.  This indicates that the debt was transferred, but the credit reporting agency did\nnot have the information.  (Transcript at 57-59, Government Exhibit 4 at 4 and 9.)\n1.j.\nThe available evidence indicates that this debt to Consumer Collection Services is\nthe same as that set forth in 1.a., above.  The Government\u2019s exhibits indicate that this is the same\ncreditor.  (Transcript at 60, Government Exhibits 4 at 4, and 7 at 1.)\n1.k.\nThe Applicant has consistently denied owing a past due debt to Midland Credit\nManagement in the amount of $10,106.00.  He testified that he has contacted the possible creditors,\nbut no one is able to give him a good answer as to what this debt is for and to whom he currently\nowes it.  (Transcript at 60-65.)\n\n4\n1.l.\nThe Applicant has consistently denied owing a past due debt for medical services in\nthe amount of $438.00.  The Applicant won a court case concerning this debt but the plaintiff\u2019s\nlawyer will not remove the entry in the credit reports out of spite.  (Transcript at 65-68.)  This entry\ndoes not appear on his most current credit report.  (Government Exhibits 5, 6 and 7.)\n1.m.\nThe Applicant has consistently denied owing a past due debt to West Asset\nManagement in the amount of $727.00 for medical care.  He testified that he contacted the original\nhospital, which informed the Applicant that they had no knowledge of any current debt owing to\nthem.   (Transcript at 69-71.)  This entry does not appear on his most current credit report.\n(Government Exhibits 5, 6 and 7.)\n1.n.\nThe Applicant has consistently denied owing a past due debt to Omnium in the\namount of $718.00 for medical care.  He testified that he contacted the original hospital, which\ninformed the Applicant that they had no knowledge of any current debt owing to them.   (Transcript\nat 69-71.)  This entry does not appear on his most current credit report.  (Government Exhibits 5, 6\nand 7.)\nThe Applicant testified that he was going to pay some past due medical debts that appeared\non his most recent credit report.  (Transcript at 71-72, Government Exhibit 7 at 2.)  The Applicant\npaid $945.00 on August 21, 2007, to resolve these debts.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 4.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n\n5\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of financial irresponsibility that demonstrates poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\n\n6\noutweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has past due debts (Guideline F).  The Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully\nmitigated the Government's case.  \nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has had financial difficulties in the past.  Accordingly,\nDisqualifying Conditions 19.a. (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and 19.c. (A history of\nnot meeting financial obligations) apply. \nThe evidence also shows, however, that the Applicant\u2019s inability to pay his debts was in large\npart related to his family and work situation between 2000 and 2004.  Almost all of the past due\ndebts date from this time.  The Applicant previously indicated his concerns to the Government\nconcerning the efficacy of credit reports.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  However, once he obtained\nthe Government\u2019s exhibits, he worked hard to resolve his indebtedness.  Of the debts listed in the\nSOR, seven have been paid off, two are duplicates of paid debts, and four others he denies and\ndisputes. \nThe Applicant testified that he is able to maintain a budget and pay his current indebtedness\nThis testimony is credible and worthy of belief.  His credit reports show that he does not abuse\ncredit.  The following Mitigating Conditions apply: 20.a. (The behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment), 20.c. (The person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control) and 20.d. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  \nI have also examined this case under the Whole Person concept as described in the General\nFactors, and as set out at length above.  They also support a finding for the Applicant.  Paragraph 1\nis found for the Applicant.  He is eligible for a security clearance.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nfor the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.n.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H. Ross\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 16, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\n2\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 23, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n(1) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify his response to two questions on his\nsecurity clearance application by failing to disclose multiple debts that had been delinquent for more\nthan 90 or 180 days.  In support of that argument, Applicant contends that he failed to disclose the\ninformation because he misunderstood the scope of the questions.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  His ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline\nE is sustainable.\n \n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns\nraised by his history of financial difficulties had been mitigated because his indebtedness had\nresulted from a failed business venture approximately six years ago, and the  circumstances which\nled to his financial problems were not likely to recur.  In support of this argument, Applicant submits\nadditional documentary evidence which was not submitted at the hearing.  He also cites to several\nDOHA Hearing Office decisions in which an applicant in ostensibly similar circumstances was\ngranted a clearance.  Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s arguments do not\ndemonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005). \nThe Board gives due consideration to the Hearing Office cases which Applicant has cited in\nhis appeal brief.  However, such decisions are not binding on Hearing Office Judges or on the Board.\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-14853 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2007).  They do not demonstrate error in this\ncase.  See ISCR Case No. 06-18340 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007). \nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security eligibility, there\nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v.\nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the\nth\ngovernment presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nestablish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts\n\nDecision at 6.\n1\n3\nof a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record\nevidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  \u201cThus, the\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\nclearance decision.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-02833 (App. Bd. Mar.19, 2007).  \u201cAs the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the Guideline F allegations had not been mitigated.  Although the Applicant strongly disagrees\nwith the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision he still had\napproximately $96,000 in outstanding debts and \u201c . . . had made no effort to pay any of the debts\nalleged, even though he had the means to do so.\u201d   In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\n1\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were recent and still ongoing.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun.\n29, 2005).  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Although the debts were corporate debts, he had personally guaranteed payment.  He did\n\n2\nnot disclose the debts on his security clearance application.  Security concerns based on financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (AG).  The SOR\nalleged security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 4, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned an administrative judge on April 11, 2007,\nand reassigned to me based on workload on July 9, 2007.  It was heard on July 19, 2007, as\nscheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old high school graduate.  He has been married since August 1992.\nHe has two children, including a son in the U.S. Navy (Tr. 36).  He has never held a security\nclearance.\nIn 1999, Applicant formed a construction company in which he was the president and sole\ncorporate shareholder.  He was licensed as a general contractor (Tr. 27).  He entered into a contract\nwith a leaseholder at local airport to build aircraft hangars.  He contracted with four vendors for\nconstruction supplies and equipment, and the vendors required that he personally guarantee payment\nfor the supplies and equipment. The leaseholder went broke, leaving Applicant personally\nresponsible for the debts (Tr. 27-28).  Relying on the leaseholder\u2019s assurances that he could obtain\nadditional funds, Applicant continued to order supplies and equipment.  Applicant wrote the\nleaseholder a letter demanding payment, but received no response (AX D; Tr. 29).  Applicant\ncontacted the bank where the leaseholder claimed he could obtain a loan, and he learned that the\nbank had declined to fund the project (Tr. 30; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) D).  \nThe vendors obtained default judgements against the corporation and against Applicant\nindividually (Government Exhibits (GX) 6-9), and the judgments were unsatisfied as of the date of\nthe hearing (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f).  Applicant did not file for bankruptcy, but instead he\ndissolved the company at some time in late 2001 (Tr. 27, 44-45, 93).  He testified he believed it\nwould be better for his creditors if he closed the company and let the creditors pursue the leaseholder\n(Tr. 46).  He testified he is able to pay the judgments, but he has not done so because he does not\nbelieve they are his personal debts (Tr. 35).\n\n4\nApplicant also used a company credit card for incidental expenses connected to the\nconstruction contract (Tr. 33).  Applicant was the personal guarantor for charges to this account (Tr.\n62).  A credit card debt of $13,691 was charged off in April 2001, and it remains unpaid (SOR \u00b6 1.c).\nApplicant negotiated an installment payment plan to pay off the default judgment alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.e.  However, his check for the first payment was dishonored, and he did not redeem the\ncheck or make any further payments (Tr. 74-75).\nApplicant also used his personal credit card for some company expenses.  A debt of $4,151\non this credit card was charged off in November 2001, and it remains unpaid (SOR \u00b6 1.g).  He\ntestified he did not pay the debt because he regarded it as a corporate debt (Tr. 81).\nApplicant received a parking ticket sometime in 1999, while on vacation (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  He\nthought the ticket was unfair, because he returned to his car and tried to move it before the ticket was\ncompletely executed.  He received a letter stating that the ticket was unpaid.  After he was\ninterviewed about the unpaid ticket by a security investigator in March 2006, he wrote a letter\ncontesting the ticket (Tr. 67, 69).  He testified he received no response to his letter and assumed the\nmatter had been dropped, until it appeared on his credit report (Tr. 66; GX 3).  In response to DOHA\ninterrogatories in July 2006 (GX 2 at 4), he stated: \u201cI wrote a letter to the parking bureau explaining\nmy position. They never responded to it. I assumed they dropped it. Guess not.  Will pay if required.\u201d\nApplicant presented no evidence that the ticket was ever paid.\nApplicant is now the president and sole shareholder in a company seeking to provide aircraft\nto fly sensors over various locations for the Department of Defense (Tr. 25).  Ninety percent of\nApplicant\u2019s business is with the Department of Defense (Tr. 37).  He started the company in\nNovember 2004, and initially capitalized it with about $10,000 of his own money (Tr. 41-42).  After\nthe company started making money he purchased six aircraft at a total cost of about $500,000.  The\naircraft were \u201cjunk\u201d when he purchased them, but he rebuilt them for use in his current business, and\nhe estimates they are now worth about $1,000,000 each (Tr. 43-44).  He estimates that his net equity\nin the company is about $7,000,000 (Tr. 26).\nIn November 2005, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (eQIP).  Even though he was the sole owner and president of the construction company\nand received a salary as president from 1999 until the company closed in 2001, he did not list the\ncompany in Section 11, pertaining to his employment record.  The omission is not alleged in the\nSOR.\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question in Section 27d of the eQIP, asking if there were any\nunpaid judgments against him in the last seven years.  He did not disclose the judgments alleged in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f.  In response to two questions in Section 28 regarding debts more than\n180 days delinquent during the last seven years and debts currently more than 90 days delinquent,\nhe disclosed one satisfied judgment, but he did not disclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and\n1.g.\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories and at the hearing, Applicant maintained that the debts\nand judgments alleged in the SOR, except for the parking ticket, were corporate debts and not\npersonal debts.  He testified he did not pay the debts because he hoped the vendors would seek\n\n5\npayment from the leaseholder.  He also testified he did not disclose the debts and judgments on his\neQIP because he thought the questions pertained only to personal debts and not to corporate debts\n(Tr. 34). He admitted he knew the creditors would look to him for payment if the corporation could\nnot pay its corporate debts (Tr. 92).\nApplicant owns his home and estimates his equity is about $400,000.  His current net\nmonthly income is about $4,800 and his net monthly expenses are about $4,000 (Tr. 89).  He\npresented letters from three business associates attesting to his trustworthiness and reliability (AX\nA, B, E). \nThe facility security officer at his current company, who has known him for thirteen years,\nconsiders him a person of high integrity and honesty, deeply involved in the local community.  She\ndescribed one incident in which Applicant decided not to litigate the award of a multimillion dollar\ncontract because he believed that the litigation would have created a break in coverage for the troops\nsupported under the contract (AX F).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the AG.  Each clearance decision\nmust be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n\n6\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows:. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG\n\u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts.\u201d  This condition is raised because Applicant admitted he was able to pay the debts but\nwas unwilling to pay them.\nAG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is \u201cindebtedness caused by\nfrivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay\nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  This condition is not raised, because\nApplicant\u2019s debts were caused by a deadbeat client rather than frivolous or irresponsible spending.\nAG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  This\ncondition is raised by Applicant\u2019s record of unpaid debts and judgments.  \nAG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis.\u201d  This condition is not raised.  Although Applicant took business\nrisks, they were reasonable under the circumstances.  What he did not anticipate was his client\u2019s\nfinancial irresponsibility.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR\nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\n\n7\ngood judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound mitigating condition, with three disjunctive\nprongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be established by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d\nor \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d  If any of the\nthree disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the\nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  I am satisfied Applicant\u2019s debts are recent and frequent, but they are not likely to recur.\nApplicant incurred his debts due in large part to business naivete.  He learned his lesson and is now\ninvolved in a highly successful business venture.  However, his refusal to pay debts that he\npersonally guaranteed, including charges on his personal credit card, casts doubt on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Thus, I conclude this mitigating condition is not\nestablished.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the persons\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nThe evidence establishes the first prong but not the second, because Applicant did not act responsibly\nwhen his client defaulted on his payments.  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).  As\nof the date of the hearing, Applicant had made no effort to pay any of the debts alleged, even though\nhe had the means to do so.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(e).  Applicant testified he disputed the parking ticket, but he\npresented no \u201cdocumented proof\u201d of his dispute and no evidence that the ticket was either paid or\ndismissed.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15.  \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d  AG \u00b6 16(a).\n\n8\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the\nomission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind\nat the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining\nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nApplicant admitted that he knew his vendors would hold him personally responsible for the\ncorporate debts if the corporation failed to pay them.  He knew he had been individually sued for the\nunpaid debts and that default judgments were entered against him as well as his company.  He knew\nhis personal credit card account had been charged off as a bad debt and remained unpaid.  I find his\nexplanation for not disclosing the judgments and debts implausible.  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose the existence of his construction company and his employment\nas president of that company suggests an attempt to conceal the entire financial misadventure\ninvolving his construction company.  This omission from his employment record was not alleged\nin the SOR.  However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered: \u201c(a) to assess an\napplicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed\ncircumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d)\nto decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to\nprovide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 03-20327\nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted).  I have considered his failure to disclose his\ninvolvement in the construction company for the limited purpose of assessing the credibility of his\ndenial of intentional falsification and to determine whether the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a)\napplies.  I conclude the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to\nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance application\nmay be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(a).\nApplicant made no effort to correct his omissions and misleading answers until he was confronted\nwith the evidence.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established.  No other mitigating\nconditions under this guideline are established.  \nLack of candor in the security clearance application process is a matter of \u201cspecial interest\u201d\nunder this guideline.  Applicant has not rebutted or mitigated the security concern raised by his lack\nof candor.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n9\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a mature adult.  He presented himself as intelligent and articulate at the hearing.\nAll the debts except the parking ticket arose from one failed construction contract.  He has learned\nfrom his business mistakes, but has not changed his attitude about personal responsibility for\ncorporate debts that he personally guaranteed.  Absent a change of attitude, the likelihood of\nrecurrence remains a concern.  His debts are significant, but he is not financially overextended.\nBecause he is financially secure, there is minimal potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress.  However, his lack of candor about his involvement in the construction business and the\ndebts arising from it are a serious concern that remains unmitigated.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security concerns based on financial considerations and personal conduct.  Accordingly, I\nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On November 29, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n1\n2\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 19, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before\nan administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.  On June 6, 2007, I convened\na hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na trustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted\nexhibits that were admitted into evidence.  Applicant submitted additional exhibits within the two\nweeks allowed at the hearing, marked Exhibits H to M, which I admitted into the record without\nobjection from the Government.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 54 years old, married, and has two children.  He works for a defense contractor\nin the health care benefits business.  He retired from the Air Force in 1992 and receives a monthly\npension.  After his military retirement, he had three civilian jobs, all of which ended in layoffs not\ndue to any fault of Applicant.  When laid off from work, Applicant obtained part-time or temporary\nwork to support his family.  As a result of the layoffs, Applicant and his wife filed Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in November 1997.  His debts were discharged in bankruptcy in March 1998 (SOR\n\u00b61.a.). (Tr. 34, 36, 38, 51, 52, 73-76; Exhibits 1, 2-4)\nApplicant obtained a college degree in health care management in 2000.  He took out student\nloans to pay for that degree.  He is now repaying those loans at $150 per month.  With that degree,\nhe was able to obtain employment in the job he now has.  His income is approximately $49,000\nannually. (Tr. 36, 38, 52; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant moved to his present location in June 2004.  He could not sell his house at his prior\nlocation until October 2004, thereby causing him to spend money on the mortgage and rent in his\nnew location for six months.  His wife, a nurse, was injured on the job in 2005 and not able to work\nfor four months.  She currently commutes to another city for a nursing job, working on a contractual\nbasis.  She started that job in June 2007, after not working since February 2007, for medical reasons\n\n3\nand a layoff. Her income dropped from $68,000 to $48,000 annually after her move from their\nformer state of residence. (Tr. 34, 36-41, 44, 67; Exhibits I, J)\nApplicant incurred several debts that were not repaid in a timely manner.  They have now\nbeen repaid using the $5,000 profit from his house sale, and an inheritance his wife received from\nher late mother.  Applicant pays cash for any purchases now, and uses two debit cards linked to his\nbank accounts for the payment of debts and current purchases.  He also has a contract with a credit\ncounselor. (Tr. 39, 41, 42, 50, 58, 59)\nApplicant owed $193 for a water bill at his previous residence that he sold in October 2004\n(SOR \u00b61.b).  The attorney handling the real estate closing was supposed to pay that debt from the\nsale proceeds.  That debt was paid February 1, 2002. (Tr. 24, 52, 53, 68-70; Exhibits E, 2-4)\nApplicant owed $188 on a cable television debt (SOR \u00b61.c).  That debt was paid by check\non June 5, 2007, in the amount of $290. (Tr. 24; Exhibit D, Answer)\nApplicant owed $2,886 to a creditor (SOR \u00b61.d).  This debt was paid in full on or before\nMarch 26, 2007. (Tr. 22; Exhibits C, 2-4)\nApplicant owed a bank $216 (SOR \u00b61.e).  Applicant paid a settlement amount of $179.57\nin May or June 2007.  That debt is now paid in full. (Tr. 18; Exhibits A, 2-4)\nApplicant owed another bank $579 (SOR \u00b61.f).  That debt was paid by deduction from\nApplicant\u2019s bank account in April 2007, in the amount of $625.29. (Tr. 20, 54, 55, 64; Exhibits B,\nL, 2-4)\nApplicant owed a creditor $9,381 on a repossessed car (SOR \u00b61.g).  Applicant\u2019s son had the\ncar and was supposed to make the payments, but did not.  Applicant\u2019s wife paid $2,000 on the\naccount, but the car was repossessed anyway in February 2007.  Applicant has not been contacted\nby the creditor for any balance owed, but he will contact the creditor to verify any amount owed and\narrange a payment plan.  He hired an attorney to help him obtain information from the creditor to\nresolve this debt. (Tr. 27-32, 34, 38, 65, 71, 72; Exhibits B, O, P, 2-4, Answer)\nApplicant owes $9,348 on his student loans (SOR \u00b61.h).  He is now paying $150 monthly\non that debt.  This loan was in forbearance mode from May 7, 2006, to May 6, 2007. (Tr. 32, 34, 60,\n75; Exhibits 2-4, Answer )\nApplicant owes $786 to a furniture company (SOR \u00b61.i).  He paid that debt in two\ninstallments, first $500 in January 2007, then $285.87 from another bank account in February 2007.\nThe debt is fully paid. (Tr. 25, 26, 53, 64; Exhibits F,G, K, 2-4, Answer)\nApplicant did not know of these unpaid debts because his wife managed the household\nmoney.  She has done this since they were married.  She did not tell him about their financial\nshortfalls because she was embarrassed about it.  She did not want him to worry about it as he\nworked to support the family.  She now pays the student loan and car loan payments by a direct pay\narrangement from Applicant\u2019s military retirement pay.  They have a budget now that they use\nshowing a positive cash flow of income over expenses.  Her explanation is credible, sincere, and\n\n4\npersuasive about Applicant\u2019s lack of knowledge of the unpaid bills. (Tr. 42, 44-49, 58, 73-76;\nExhibit H)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\n\n5\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F: Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts totaled $23,577.  He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin November 1997 because of his unpaid and delinquent debts that had accumulated to that time.\nApplicant has a difficult time managing his money in the context of his low-paying jobs and frequent\nlayoffs in the 1990s after he retired from the Air Force.  The disqualifying conditions applicable are\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\nand \u00b619.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nApplicant suffered several job losses after his retirement from the Air Force.  He kept\nworking at whatever job he could find to support his family.  After his Chapter 7 bankruptcy,\nApplicant got a college degree and now has a better paying job.  He had further financial difficulties\nmoving to the location of his current job in that he could not sell his former residence promptly and\n\n6\nhad to pay that mortgage and his rent in his new location.  Now, with that house sold, he applied his\nnet gain from the sale to his debt repayments.  His wife contributed her inheritance to paying the\ndebts.  They have a plan for repaying debts, and the only one not currently being addressed is the\nauto loan, on which they are working to contact the creditor and arrange payment.  The Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions applicable are \u00b620.b (the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances), and \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  Applicant has taken responsible and good-faith\nefforts to control his spending and repay his debts.\nWhole Person Analysis  \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\u201d\ntrustworthiness decision. Directive \u00b62.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive\n\u00b62.\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties extend back into the 1990s.  They were serious, but caused\nby external employment circumstances.  He had three jobs he lost through corporate layoffs.  He kept\nworking to support his family at any job he could find.  He got more education to better prepare\nhimself for the marketplace.  His wife kept the family finances and did not share the information\nabout their recent financial situation with him to prevent him from worrying about it as he strived\nto find employment and support the family.  He was, therefore, not fully knowledgeable about the\ncurrent status of his delinquent debts.  The financial problems are past, not recent or current, because\nhe has a higher income now and his wife is working again after her 2004 injuries healed.  There are\nbehavioral changes, in that Applicant pays cash or uses a debit card for all purchases.  He and his\nwife undertook to use the net gain on their house sale and her inheritance to pay their debts instead\nof spending it on other purchases, thereby acting responsibly.  There is no likelihood of a recurrence\nof their previous financial situation based on their budget and present incomes, and therefore, no\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Lastly, I conclude Applicant is very credible\nin his explanations of his past financial difficulty and his efforts to repay his debts. \nI conclude the Financial Considerations trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  I also\nconclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d evaluation for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.a. to 1.i.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn January 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations,\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn an undated sworn statement, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to\nhave her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on February 26, 2007. The FORM was mailed to\nApplicant on February 28, 2007, and received on March 2, 2007. Applicant was afforded an\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\nresponded on March 9, 2007. The case was assigned to me on March 22, 2007. \nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nThe case file did not indicate Applicant received a copy of the revised AG issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. On\nMarch 23, 2007, an Order was sent to Department Counsel. Department Counsel was ordered to\ncontact Applicant to inquire as to whether the revised Adjudicative Guidelines were sent to\nApplicant.  If not, the order states Department Counsel will send Applicant a copy of the Revised\nAGs and give her 30 days to review and respond to the revised AGs. On April 2, 2007, Department\nCounsel spoke with Applicant and she confirmed on April 3, 2007, she received a copy of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines. \nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, Item 3, contained numerous attachments.

She is hospitalized approximately once a year due to\nher condition.   She incurred a lot of the medical bills when she did not have medical insurance,\n7\nespecially when she was a full-time student. Even when she had insurance, co-payments were a\nfinancial burden to her family expenses.  In response to interrogatories, dated November 30, 2006,\n8\nApplicant indicated her husband was injured in a motorcycle accident in August 2006.  He was\nunable to work indefinitely  resulting in Applicant being the sole provider for the family. She stated\nthat she would pay the debts as soon as she had the money.9\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided proof that she resolved all of the delinquent\naccounts in the SOR.  She was able to pay off the debts with a cash settlement her husband received\n10\nrelated to his motorcycle accident.   The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was paid on February 7, 2007.\n11\n12\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was paid in full on February 7, 2007.

The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern\nas it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that cannot be\nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.22\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n23\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n24\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\n\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n25\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n27\n Item 5, Credit Report dated November 7, 2006, p. 5.\n28\n6\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n25\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.26\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n27\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nApplicant's poor financial history raises a security concern. She has encountered financial\nproblems since she was a college student.  She was only recently able to resolve her delinquent\naccounts as a result of monies received from a settlement related to her husband's motorcycle\naccident. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's\ncase. \nThe financial considerations concern can be mitigated.  I find that Financial Considerations\nMitigating Conditon (FC MC) 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), applies, in part.  The majority of Applicant's\ndelinquent accounts are medical bills. Her chronic asthma contributed to her financial burdens,\nespecially when she had no health insurance.  Her husband's motorcycle accident in August 2006,\nprevented him from working.  The record is not clear as to whether he is currently unable to work.\nIt is also not clear how much income he brought into the household.  Regardless, his inability to work\nadversely affected Applicant's ability to resolve her delinquent accounts.  However, I also note that\nApplicant purchased a time share in 2003.  This is a frivolous expense and indicates poor judgment\n28\non Applicant's part.  The money would have been better spent towards her delinquent accounts. For\nthis reason, I give FC MC 20(b) less weight.\n\n7\nFC MC 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications the problem is being resolved or under control) applies.  Applicant resolved all\nof the delinquent accounts in the SOR.  Her financial problems appear to be under control. There is\nnothing in the file indicating that she received financial counseling. It is strongly recommended\nApplicant attend financial counseling to learn how to budget her expenses in order to prevent her from\nhaving financial problems in the future.  \nAlthough the resolution of Applicant's debts were at the last minute, she resolved her accounts\nwhen she and her husband received the monetary settlement. FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.  \nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.

(TR 19)\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns over his personal conduct, sexual behavior and\ncriminal conduct based on his long history of following minor children and masturbating in his car\nfrom 1985 to 1997 which ultimately led to his arrest and guilty plea in 1998 to a misdemeanor charge\nof Public Sexual Indecency.  He waited until January 2007 to seek  treatment, so he is still in the\nearly stages.  Security concerns persist despite a favorable prognosis from his therapist.  While he\nhas taken some steps to reform his conduct, he failed to demonstrate sufficient positive changes in\nbehavior, especially in light of the potential for blackmail and duress as he  failed to divulge his past\nmisconduct either to his current wife or family and friends.   Consequently, security concerns remain\nover personal conduct, sexual behavior and criminal conduct.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on November 16, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over personal\n1\nconduct (Guideline E) in paragraph 1, over sexual behavior (Guideline D) in paragraph 2, and over\ncriminal conduct (Guideline J) based on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of December 13, 2006, where\nhe admitted all paragraph 1 allegations and provided a letter with explanations, but failed to answer\nallegations in paragraphs 2, 2.a., 3 and 3.a.  He requested a decision without a hearing.  However,\nDepartment Counsel on January 9, 2007, requested a hearing under paragraph E3.1.7 of the\nAdditional Procedural Guidance of Enclosure 3 to DoD Directive 5220.6; and he informed Applicant\nby letter of January 9, 2007.  \nDepartment Counsel indicated the case was ready to proceed on January 30, 2007.  The\nmatter was assigned to another Administrative Judge on February 1, 2007.  Subsequently,\nApplicant\u2019s counsel entered his appearance on February 20, 2007.  A Notice of Hearing, issued on\nMarch 14, 2007, set the matter for March 28, 2007, at a location near where Applicant works and\nlives. Applicant received the notice on March 20, 2007, only eight days prior to the hearing which\nwas outside the 15 days notice required which his counsel would not waive. The case was re-\nassigned to me on March 27, 2007.  A March 30, 2007, Notice of Hearing re-set the case hearing for\nApril 18, 2007. \nAt the hearing the Government offered eleven exhibits  (Exhibit 1-11) which were admitted\ninto evidence; I overruled Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s hearsay and other objections  to police reports\n2\n(Exhibits 5-10).  Applicant testified; his counsel called one witness, qualified as an expert, and\n\n       The record was not clear as to how he lost his Top Secret security clearance in 1998 but retained his\n3\nSecret clearance. (TR 72) In addition to his statement and admission in the SF 86 (Exhibit 1), he also\nprovided a statement in March 1995 to a special investigator for the Air Force (Exhibit 3) and to a special\nagent of the Defense Security Service in August 1998 (Exhibit 4).  Perhaps his clearance was withdrawn by\nanother agency, not DoD, as Applicant testified he retained his DoD Secret clearance.  His counsel stated\nthe SF86 submitted in January 2005 was for a ten-year update.  (Exhibit 1; TR 72-75, 126)\n3\nsubmitted Exhibit A, his resume. Government counsel indicated no objection, so the document was\nadmitted into evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on April 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\n  \nApplicant, 54 years old, has worked as an engineer for a defense contractor from August\n1984 to present.  He completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in January 2005.  He\nreported that he initially received a Secret Defense Department security clearance in 1988.  But, he\nstated he lost  a security clearance in August 1998 as a result of a misdemeanor conviction reported\n3\nin answer to Question 26.  He testified that he has either been evaluated as having met or exceeded\nexpectations. (Exhibit 1; TR 60-62)  \nApplicant served in the military from 1972 to 1975; he did not report his discharge status.\n(Exhibit 1)\nApplicant received a B.S.E.E. from a state university in May 1975.  Applicant met his first\nwife (Wife #1) in an overseas military assignment and married her in November 1976; they were\ndivorced in September 1995.  He and this wife had three adopted daughters.  Shortly after his divorce\nhe met a woman who moved in with him.  He stated they had a troubled relationship and never\nmarried.  Later, he remarried in October 2004.  (Exhibits 1, 7; TR 63-68) \nPersonal Conduct, Sexual Behavior and Criminal Conduct\nApplicant disclosed that in June 1998 he was convicted for a 1997 offense of Public Sexual\nIndecency, a misdemeanor for which he received one year of unsupervised parole from a city court.\n(Answer; Exhibit 1)  \n\u2022\nApplicant admitted that from June 1985 to October 1997 he frequently followed minor\nchildren in his car and masturbated while following them in order to satisfy his sexual\ndesires.   (SOR 1.a., 2.a., 3.a.)  Several of the girls were frighted and called police who filed\nreports on his misconduct.  When the police interviewed him in June 1989, Applicant\nexplained he had not sought counseling as he was too embarrassed to talk to anyone about\nhis conduct. He also admitted he understood that his conduct frightened these \u201ckids.\u201d  He\nwas not arrested as there were no known victims, but police warned him to stop his conduct\nin 1989.  He admitted to the police that he had driven around and masturbated in his vehicle\nfrom 50 to 100 times.  (Answer; Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; TR 95-100)   In March 1995 he\n\n       Applicant\u2019s belief expressed in 1998 that he could not be blackmailed about this information does not\n4\nmitigate that concern especially as he has continued his pattern of non-disclosure about this conduct to the\npresent day.  \n4\nprovided a statement explaining his interpretation as to why he engaged in this sexual\nmisconduct.  He admitted, \u201cI realized what I was doing was very wrong and there is no\nexcuse for this type of deviant behavior.\u201d  He also stated he was in the process of ending his\nmarriage to Wife #1 as he believed his unsatisfying marriage contributed to this pattern.  He\nalso excused his conduct by stating  that \u201cthis behavior has not occurred in quite some time\nand I believe I am in control again and will not engage in this type of behavior in the future.\u201d\nHe was also aware that this conduct  created a \u201cpotential for. . .blackmail\u201d as he had not\nmade the problem widely known except to his immediate family. (Exhibit 3, March 1995;\nTR 91-95)  He explained he had continued this conduct out of habit as a junior high school\nwas near his route from work.  He no longer drives through that area.  (TR 70-71) He chose\nthat area as the junior high school was a \u201creliable source\u201d of what it \u201ctook to get him off.\u201d\n(TR 84-85)  In 1995 he reported he planned to divorce his wife and cease this conduct.\nHowever, then he began a troubled relationship with another woman.  When that relationship\ndissolved, he again engaged in sexual misconduct.  (Exhibit 3; TR 102-103)\n\u2022\nIn March 1998 a criminal complaint was filed against him charging him with two counts of\nPublic Sexual Indecency, both felonies, after he followed two minor children home from\nschool in September 1997; he had masturbated in his car while following them to satisfy his\nsexual desires.   In June 1998 he pleaded guilty and was found guilty of a lesser misdemeanor\ncharge of Public Sexual Indecency.   (SOR 1.b., 2.a., 3.a.) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 9, 10)  Again,\nhe was driving around a junior high school and following girls and stared removing his shirt\nwhile he masturbated.  (Exhibit 10; TR 104)  He explained in a DSS Statement that the\nprosecutor and his attorney interviewed the two victims in June 1998.  As one was not a\nminor and the other did not actual see Applicant expose himself, the charges were reduced\nto a single misdemeanor of sexual indecency.  He admitted having a problem with this\nbehavior for ten years beginning in 1987 when he would drive around aimlessly between\nwork and home and masturbate while in the car during \u201chigh stress\u201d times.  He reported he\nhad been interviewed by police and \u201cconfessed\u201d his activity to them.  After he ended his first\nmarriage in 1995, from 1996 to June 1997 he had a relationship with another woman which\nwas stressful. After the stresses from the breakup, he again began to drive around\nneighborhoods and masturbate.  In September 1997 he \u201cwas unable to control\u201d himself.\nLater he and the girlfriend reconciled as friends; he allowed her to move back into his house\nin October 1997 to at least August 1998.  He did not tell  this girlfriend of his sexual\n4\nmisconduct as he was ashamed of his behavior.  (Exhibit 4, August 1998)  He did complete\nhis unsupervised probation successfully.  (Exhibit 1; TR 68-69)  Applicant stated he and his\nlawyer are seeking to have this conviction set aside.  (TR 75-76)\n\u2022\nApplicant did not seek treatment for his deviant sexual behavior after his conviction in 1998\nas he was ashamed of his behavior and feared additional police contact.  (SOR 1.c., 2.a.)\n(Answer) Again, in August 2006 he was asked if he had sought treatment; he had not as he\nwas ashamed of what he had done.  (Exhibit 11) Because of the interrogatories sent to him\nin August 2006, the SOR sent to him in November 2006, and the letter in January 2008\nstating the government was requesting a hearing, he decided to begin psychotherapy with Mr.\n\n       Applicant\u2019s current belief he would not be subject to blackmail because of his conviction and past\n5\nmisconduct is not sufficient to mitigate this security concern as he has again failed to disclose this conduct\nto a significant person in his life out of embarrassment.  His current wife did not even know he had a security\nclearance hearing.  \n       The Government agreed to his expert credentials in psychotherapy.  Also, Mr. D has taken some courses\n6\nand workshops in the specialty of sexual addiction.  He has five or six current clients with those issues; he\nhas not published articles in this specialty.  He was offered as an expert in sexual addiction; however, the\ngovernment objected as he had not published in the field. Applicant\u2019s counsel countered that he was well\nversed in the field and publication was not required.  I accepted him as an expert in sexual addiction as well\nas psychotherapy.  (Exhibit A; TR 43)\n       The expert based his opinion solely on the information that Applicant disclosed to him; he did not\n7\nreview any of the arrest records or police documents.  (TR 47; 53-54) Applicant and he did not initially\ndiscuss his conduct when he followed minors in his car and masturbated  Instead they discussed issues that\nunderlie sexual addiction.  (TR 49-51) He did not Applicant take a battery of psychological tests.  (TR 53)\n5\nD (credentials detailed below) in January 2007.  He also took this step because he had\nreceived the Directive which explained that counseling was a mitigating factor.  His shame\nprevented him from seeking such help earlier, but he did not want to lose his job.  (Exhibit\n11; TR 76-77; 85-90) Applicant also reported attending Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA)\nthree or four times since March 2007.  (TR 77; 82-82) \nApplicant testified he regrets his past behavior and attested that the last time he engaged in\npublic sexual indecent behavior was in September 1997.  (TR 79-81)   He has not told  his current\n5\nwife of this past sexual misconduct nor of the security clearance hearing. Neither has he disclosed\nthis conduct to family and friends.  He has only discussed this conduct in SAA meetings.  (TR 78,\n105-106)\nExpert in Psychotherapy and Sexual Addiction\nApplicant\u2019s expert witness, Mr. D, has been a solo practitioner in psychotherapy in private\npractice from May 1989 to present.  He has an MA in counseling psychology granted in 1983. He\nhas specialized in the past five to seven years on sexual deviancy which he referred to as sexual\naddiction and sexual compulsive behaviors.  Mr. D has counseled twenty to thirty individuals with\nthis diagnosis. He was qualified as an expert  in psychotherapy and sexual addiction. (Exhibit A; TR\n6\n29-34; 34-43) \nMr D reported he first met Applicant in late January 2008 when he sought help for \u201csome\nsexual issues,\u201d including periods of asexual activity in his relationship. He has seen Applicant\nweekly since then.  His understanding of Applicant\u2019s background is based solely on what Applicant\ntold him as he did not review any police records.   Applicant also disclosed his interest in\n7\npornography which continued to 2006.   Recently, Applicant disclosed to the therapist his arrest in\n1996 or 1997 and his previously being questioned by police when no arrest was made. Mr. D\n\n     Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n8\n6\ndiagnosed Applicant with generalized anxiety disorder or impulse control disorder.  The therapist\nhas worked with Applicant on how to handle his stress.  Applicant has attended all scheduled\nsessions and has followed through on assignments.  He does not assess Applicant as a pedophile.\n(TR 43-48; 52)  His prognosis for Applicant was good as he has not acted out sexually in public in\nten years.  However, as part of his treatment, he  recommended that Applicant attend a 12-step group,\nSex Addicts Anonymous (SAA).  Applicant has complied with that recommendation.  (TR 45-46;\n47; 51-53) The expert could not say for certain that Applicant would never engage in sexually\ncompulsive behaviors again.  (TR 55)  However, the expert has seen other people manage their\naddiction in an appropriate way.  (TR 57-58)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which  are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding whether\n to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the mere presence or absence\nof any adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole in evaluating this case, I weighed these relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines:\n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely\n8\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline E:  Personal Conduct\n15. The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n\n        Applicant provided no information on the stability of his current marriage.\n9\n7\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  \nThe government provided substantial evidence that Applicant\u2019s personal conduct raised\nsecurity concerns under disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 16. (e)., personal conduct, or concealment\nof information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofession or community standing. . . .as he has failed to disclose his sexual misconduct to his\ncurrent wife or to friends and family which raises the potential for vulnerability to duress.  Earlier\nhe had not disclosed his misconduct to his girlfriend.  While he has recently started attending a 12-\nstep program where he has shared his past conduct, those meetings have confidentiality as a\nhallmark, so engagement in SAA, though commendable, would not provide a basis to mitigate a\nconcern over vulnerability to duress. Applicant admitted to being extremely ashamed and\nembarrassed about this behavior and used those reasons as a justification for keeping these issues\nsecret. While that may be understandable, those concerns also led him to postpone seeking treatment\neither in the 1985 to 1997, a period where he was most active and urged by the police to seek help.\nNeither did he seek treatment after his criminal conviction in 1998. Nor did he do so even after the\nSOR was issued in November 2006.  It was not until he was advised that the Government would seek\na hearing in his case, that he consulted a therapist in January 2008.  \nThe relevant mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 17.(d) requires an individual  to acknowledge the\nbehavior and obtain counseling to change the behavior or to take other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and a prognosis that such behavior is unlikely to recur.  To his credit, Applicant has finally\nsought counseling; however, his therapist has not reviewed his criminal records nor done any\npsychological testing.  He has required Applicant to attend an SSA 12-step program where Applicant\nhas to confront his conduct.  He has only met with Applicant for a few sessions. While Mr. D\nprovided a good prognosis as Applicant has not acted out sexually in public in ten years, he could\nnot say for certain that Applicant would never engage in sexually compulsive behaviors again.  At\nthe time of the hearing he had only been in therapy for three months and more recently began\nattending SSA.  Nonetheless, despite this therapy, Applicant had not yet disclosed this troubling past\nto his current wife  or family and friends which suggests the potential for blackmail remains.  Three\n9\nmonths is too short a time frame to conclude with reasonable certainty that Application will be able\nto manage his addiction in an appropriate way as he admitted that as recently as 2006 he was\nengaged in viewing pornography.  Thus, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\nand all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to\nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct considerations.  I rule against\nApplicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior\n12.  The Concern.  Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or\n\n8\nwhich many subject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation,\nor duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information.  No adverse inference concerning\nthe standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual\norientation of the individual.\nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior which\npersisted over a long period of time from at least 1985 to 1997 when police reports were made that\nhe frequently followed minor children and masturbated in his car in order to satisfy his sexual desires.\nHe repeated this conduct in 1997 and pleaded guilty to Public Sexual Indecency, a misdemeanor,  in\n1998.  While he has testified he subsequently ceased this conduct, he admits he has continued an\ninterest in pornography to 2006.  Thus, disqualifying concerns raised include:  \u00b6 13. (a) sexual\nbehavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted; \u00b6 13. (c) sexual\nbehavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress; \u00b6 13. (d)\nsexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.  \nIt is possible to mitigate security concerns under this guideline. Two relevant mitigating\nconditions (MC) include:  \u00b6 14. (b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment; or \u00b6 14. (c) the behavior no longer\nserves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.  While Applicant testified he has not engaged\nin public sexual misconduct since 1997, the behavior, in the period when it did happen, was frequent\nand repeated and recurred even after he had been interviewed and encouraged by the police to seek\ntreatment.  Yet he persisted.  While he has recently sought treatment in January 2007 to April 2007,\nas discussed above under personal conduct, he has failed to meet his burden of establishing that his\nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  For example, he has yet to disclose his past sexual misconduct to his\ncurrent wife and family; so the potential for duress persists.  \n After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule\nagainst Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a. under SOR Paragraph 2.\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\n30.  The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe government\u2019s security concerns under criminal conduct parallel the concerns alleged in\npersonal conduct under subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. and establish security concerns under\ndisqualifying conditions under \u00b6 31.(a), a single serious crime, and  \u00b6 31. (c) allegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconviction.  As discussed above, Applicant\u2019s sexual misconduct persisted over a long period of time\nfrom at least 1985 to 1997 which led to multiple police reports and his repeated misconduct resulted\nin a criminal misdemeanor conviction in 1998 where he pleaded guilty to Public Sexual Indecency.\nIt is possible to mitigate security concerns under this guideline:  \u00b6 32. Conditions that could\nmitigate security concerns include: \u00b6 32.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\n\n9\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individuals reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \u00b6 32.(b) the person was\npressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in the\nperson's life;  \u00b6 32.(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; \u00b6 32.(d) there is evidence\nof successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record,\nor constructive community involvement.  \nTo his credit, Applicant finally sought therapy in January 2007 to address the underlying\nissues that led to his sexual misconduct and conviction.  However as discussed under the other\nguidelines, he is just in the early stages of his therapy and recently began attending SSA, a 12-step\nprogram.  Under MC \u00b6 32. (a) he did establish that  much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened; however, because of his delay in seeking therapy, no one yet can concluded with certainty\nthat his misconduct  is unlikely to recur.  Thus, doubt does persist over his reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.  On the other hand, under MC \u00b6 32. (d), Applicant did demonstrate evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of over several years without\nrecurrence of any criminal activity as there has been no additional sexual misconduct  arrests reported.\nAlso he reported a satisfactory employment record, but he provided no evidence of constructive\ncommunity involvement.  He has made substantial progress; but because of his delay in seeking\ntherapy, doubts persist over his suitability to have access to classified information. \nWhole Person Analysis\nHaving considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, I\nconclude he is an earnest person who has struggled with reforming his life style and has finally made\nprogress by seeking treatment from a psychotherapist. However, his continuing to keep his past sexual\nmisconduct and criminal conviction secret from key people in his life leads to continuing security\nconcerns. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is high even though he has a\nlong-term and favorable employment history. \nConsequently, after looking at him as a whole person and considering the Adjudicative\nProcess factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 3.a. under\nSOR Paragraph 3.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Clearance is\ndenied.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 28, 2007, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndetermination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nraised trustworthiness concerns raised under Guidelines F.  She also argues that the Judge gave\ninsufficient weight to the favorable evidence in the record, particularly her outstanding job\nperformance and the fact that she has no criminal record.   Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate\n1\nthat the Judge erred.\nThe legality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstance does not preclude a Judge from\nconsidering whether they raise trustworthiness concerns.  Cf., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 5 (App.\nBd. July 29, 2005). The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven\nconduct under any of its Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility.  Cf., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-28935 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 28, 2005).  The federal government need not wait until an\napplicant actually mishandles or fails to properly handle sensitive information before it can deny or\nrevoke access to such information.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. June 6, 2007).\nTrustworthiness determinations are not limited to consideration of an applicant's job performance\nor conduct during duty hours, and off-duty conduct can be relevant in assessing an applicant's\ntrustworthiness eligibility. ADP Case No. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).  An applicant\nwith good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative trustworthiness\nimplications.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. June 6, 2007).  The Directive's\nGuidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of\ntrustworthiness concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine an\napplicant's trustworthiness eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace. Id.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\n\n3\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nADP Case No. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).

Her debts were mitigated by unemployment, under-employment\nand hospitalization over an extended period, which was beyond her control. Her financial situation\nhas improved due to her present full time employment and court ordered child support payments\nfrom her former husband. She is in a position to continue and increase the re-payments to the bank\nand there is little likelihood of recurrence of the problem. Her omission of information relating to\ndelinquent debt on her public trust application was not deliberate with intent to deceive. Clearance\nis granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for an ADP clearance for Applicant.\nDOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether such a\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nOn September 21, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a\nhearing. The matter was assigned to another judge on October 24, 2006, and assigned to me on\nDecember 15, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on January 18, 2007, for a hearing on February\n6, 2007, and held that day. The government offered three exhibits and Applicant offered eight into\nevidence and all were accepted. The record was left open for until March 9, 2007, for submission\nby the Applicant of additional material. The transcript was received on February 14, 2007. One\nsubmission consisting of eleven documents was made on March 2, 2007, and admitted in evidence\nwithout objection. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted two of the three allegations relating to delinquent debts with explanatory\ninformation for all. She denied the single allegation relating to falsification of financial information\non her application for a security clearance (SF 86). She appended two documents to her answer.\nAfter a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old customer service representative for a defense contractor health\nprovider and has held this position since September 2005. She has a responsible position working\nwith medical information for military personnel and is highly regarded by her employer (Exhs. E,\nF, and G). Her work involves  making telephone calls to military personnel and their families\nregarding  claims against insurance companies and health service providers. She takes great pride\nin her work and especially so since her father served 20 years in the military. She has worked for her\npresent employer since September, 2005. \n\n3\nBefore her present employment she worked for several years as a customer representative and\ncashier for several employers. From July 2001 until the end of January 2002 she worked in a bank\nwhere she was employed as a part time bank teller while holding another part time job. During that\nperiod she was offered full time 40 hours a week employment at an hourly rate as a teller filling a\nfull time position of another employee, who had family medical problems. She quit her other part\ntime job to work full time at the bank. \nDuring the period of her bank employment in 2001, Applicant made a consolidation loan\nwith her employer in the amount of $20,000. This is the principal delinquent debt alleged (SOR 1.b.).\nA second easy access loan was taken for $2,000 and subsequently reduced to $1,800 (SOR\n1.c.).Payments were to be made to the bank of $294 each month, which was to be disbursed to\ncreditors (Exh H Post submission). These payments were used on December 10, 2001, to pay the\ndebt of $816 alleged in SOR 1.a. (Exh. D Post submission). Subsequently, her hours of work were\ncut to between seven and eleven per week because of personnel changes. She could not keep up the\npayments and was laid off in July 2002 because the bank could not have an employee who was in\ndefault on a loan to them. She was again working with only part time employment. \nThe bank filed suit to collect, resulting in a hearing and an agreement in 2002 to pay $100\nper month to settle the account. Some payments were made over the next two years and the bank\nappears to have been flexible in collecting. She had a serious automobile accident in February 2005\nthat resulted in surgery in October 2005 shortly after she began her new job. She was unable to work\nuntil January 2006. Although she was paid disability insurance during convalescence, she could not\nmake the bank payments on a regular basis, and so advised the bank. They agreed to defer payments\nuntil she resumed her work \nThe agreement with the bank was re-confirmed on February 26, 2007, (Exh. C Post\nsubmission). She has made payments since the new agreement was reached. Since obtaining her\npresent full time position her annual salary, after recent promotions, is almost $29,000 (Exh. L Post\nsubmission). She intends to pay more than the required minimum, and her income level indicates\nthat is now possible.\nApplicant has one child, a daughter who is in college. She recently was awarded a judgment\nagainst her former husband for child support arrears in the amount of $19,000 which she can collect.\nShe is active as a missionary in her church whose bishop vouched for her good character (Exh. J\nSupplemental submission). \nApplicant failed to report delinquent debts at Question 20 of her Public Trust Position\nApplication (SF 85 P) submitted September 21, 2005. This question asked if she was over 180 days\ndelinquent on any loan or financial obligation. She knew the SOR 1.a. debt had been paid and\nbelieved that her agreement for payments to the bank meant that she was not delinquent on the two\nbank loans. \nPOLICIES\n\n4\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . .\n. that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988). In Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information, \u00a7 3.1(b) (August 4,\n1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only\nto United States citizens \u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to\nthe United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound\njudgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness\nand ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified\ninformation.\u201d  \nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to\nsensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security.\u201d DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets\nforth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline. \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  DoD 5200.2-R,\nAppendix 8.  An administrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and\ncarefully weigh the available, reliable information about the person. Id. An administrative judge\nshould consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Id.  \nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive\n5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be made. DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C8.2.1.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.14. Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment. The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7 7.\n\n5\nIt is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts cited in the SOR prompted the allegation of security concern\nunder Guideline F since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence\nof inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) \nMitigating Conditions (MC) might include the fact that the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (E2.A6.1.3.3.), and the person has initiated a good\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.). There is sufficient\nevidence that the debts resulted from conditions beyond her control because of her employment\nchanges at the bank where she had the loan, compounded last year by her accident and\nhospitalization. She now has sufficient income from her salary and child support that she can pay\nthe loan to the bank and the likelihood of a recurrence of the problem is minimal. While the bank\nloan helped her out of the immediate problems she had in 2001, the reduction in employment and\nthe loss of that job complicated her financial recovery. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to report her financial delinquencies at Questions 20 on her SF 85 P raises\nissues under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information (E2.A5.1.1.). Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from a trustworthiness application could raise a security\nconcern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) Applicant\u2019s explanation of the circumstances of the\nloans from the bank and her understanding of the state of her debts in relation to those loans was\ncredible and thus, I cannot conclude that it was deliberate omission as the guideline requires. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and\nomissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nApplicant impressed me at the hearing as a proud person who is hard-working. Her\ndelinquent debts accumulated largely as a result of checkered history of employment for an\n\n6\nextended period resulting in a loss of control of her finances. She took out two bank loans from her\nemployer in an effort to resolve those issues but then had her employment cut and then terminated\nby the lender bank. She is a responsible parent with significant responsibilities, who now has a good\njob where she is a valued employee. There is a strong likelihood of success in effective management\nof her finances. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude in favor of the grant of a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

He has made good faith efforts to resolve the\ndebt. His continuing efforts to resolve his past financial obligations have sufficiently mitigated the\ntrustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations. Applicant's eligibility for a\ntrustworthiness position is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 18, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On August 24, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F,\nFinancial Considerations. On October 6, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nrequested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 3, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on January\n2\n11, 2007, scheduling the hearing for January 30, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The\ngovernment submitted four exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5. The\nexhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant submitted five exhibits which\nwere marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-E. The exhibits were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the\nrecord open for additional submissions. Applicant timely filed three documents for post hearing\nsubmission. The documents are marked AE F, G, and H. Department Counsel had no objection to\nthe admission of the documents. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 7, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted, with explanation, allegations, 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, in his SOR\nresponse under Guideline F.  He denied the other allegations, because he has paid some of them and\n3\nhad no knowledge of  \u201cunknown medical provider accounts\u201d listed in the SOR. The admissions are\nincorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due\nconsideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\n\nGE 1 (Public Trust Application), dated December 18, 2005 at 1-5.\n4\nTr. 26\n5\nTr. 36.\n6\nAE D (Annual Performance Evaluations), dated 2000 to 2007 at 1-5.\n7\nId.\n8\nTr. 26.\n9\nGE 2 (Affidavit and Personal Financial Statement), dated October 2, 2004 at 1-9.\n10\nAE E (Pay record), dated 2001-2007.\n11\nTr. 29.\n12\nAE F (Letter from physician, dated February 15, 2007); Tr. 58.\n13\n3\nApplicant is a married, 53-year-old team specialist of a defense contractor, seeking a position\nof public trust.  After graduating from high school in 1971, he attended a community college,\n4\nreceiving an Associate of Arts degree in 1973. Due to his poor health, he was not eligible to enlist\nin the military.  In 1976, Applicant married. However, in 1983, he divorced. His second marriage\n5\nlasted from 1985 until 1996. In 1985, Applicant engaged in a lengthy custody battle for his daughter.\nThis created approximately $100,000 in legal expenses for Applicant. He managed to support his\nfamily during this time. Applicant married for the third time in1998. He has 13 children, with two\ndependent children at home.  He has been with his current employer for almost seven years,\n6\nreceiving various promotions.  His performance evaluation rated him as \u201cexceeding expectations.\u201d\n7\n8\nApplicant had no financial difficulties prior to 1998. He was current on his bills. However,\nin September 1998, he was in an automobile accident. He damaged his back and has permanent\narthritis spurs. He has medication for the pain.  This resulted in unemployment for about three\n9\nmonths. He started to fall behind in his accounts. He attempted to make minimum monthly payments\nbut was living paycheck to paycheck. At the same time his wife lost her job. He accrued more debt\nand lost potential income. Shortly after returning to, work Applicant was again unemployed. He\nworked at low paying jobs and part time work to support his family. The financial delinquencies\ncontinued.10\nIn 1999, Applicant started working for his current employer. He receives an hourly wage.11\nHe and his wife, at that time, however, took custody of his wife\u2019s grandchild. The child\u2019s father was\nin jail and the mother was selling drugs, could not provide for the baby. Applicant and his wife spent\ntwo years in legal proceedings to become the legal guardians. This cost them approximately $5,000\nin legal fees.  As well as loss of pay due to absence from work for many court proceedings but they\nfelt they had no choice.  Applicant\u2019s health also continued to decline. He suffers from a low immune\n12\nsystem which subjects him to illness.\nApplicant contracted meningitis in late 1999. He has suffered from pneumonia and has severe\nallergies. His treating physician confirms his multiple respiratory infections and severe irritable\nbowel syndrome, which has caused prolonged absence from work, and some loss of pay.13\n\nGE 5 (Bankruptcy Petition and Discharge ), dated November 2002 at 1-57.\n14\nGE  supra note 6, at 1-5.\n15\nAE E supra note 11.\n16\nTr. 23, 24.\n17\nAE B (Ledger card for collection company), dated November 21, 2006.\n18\nAE A (Journal voucher for a federal credit union), dated October 13, 2006.\n19\nAE C (Account summary), dated December 2006.\n20\nTr. 69.\n21\nTr. 68.\n22\nId.\n23\n4\nIn 2002, Applicant filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy court discharged the\nindebtedness in November 2002.  He will not consider another bankruptcy proceeding.\n14\nOn December 18, 2005, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application SF 85-P.15\nApplicant\u2019s work history prior to his current employment was, as noted above, uneven. He produced\nevidence at the hearing confirming that his income with his current employer has varied widely over\nthe past years due to illness.  His recent illness has caused further delay in paying on his delinquent\n16\naccounts.  Applicant was on temporary disability last year, at the recommendation of his doctor. At\n17\none point his doctor suggested permanent disability, but Applicant asked for modifications and\nrestrictions at work instead.\nApplicant\u2019s debts in SOR include two judgments which have been satisfied.  A judgment\n18\nfor one property management company was listed three times. Applicant\u2019s testimony was credible\nconcerning the property management judgment. The owner of the property released him from the\nunpaid rent and security deposit. The owner expressly told Applicant that the property management\ncompany did not have the owner\u2019s consent to file the judgment. A collection account in the amount\nof $8,773 has a zero balance.  A charged off account in the amount of $178 is paid in full. Applicant\n19\nis paying another debt of $1,209 on a regular basis.  \n20\n Applicant provided information about the origin of the debts. He lived frugally and none of\nthe debts were due to excessive spending. Several unpaid accounts, totaling less than $400 are to\nmedical institutions.   He acknowledges that the lengthy custody battles put his debts, other than\n21\nliving expenses on the back burner. He has selected the most important debts and made an effort to\nresolve them. The one large debt remaining is due to the voluntary repossession of a used automobile\nin 2004.  He had been making payments on the vehicle, but the vehicle was constantly breaking\n22\ndown. It was under a warranty, but the dealer did not honor the warranty. Applicant told them to\ncome and pick up the car.23\n. \n\nTr. 101, 102.\n24\nTr. 103.\n25\nTr. 76.\n26\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated October 2006.\n27\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n28\n5\nApplicant\u2019s remaining debts are as follows: $6,495 balance on an auto loan (voluntary\nrepossession) in 2004; $50 medical account in 2003; $200 medical account in collection in 2003;\n$75 medical account in collection in 2003; $50 medical account in collection in 2004; and $1,014\ndelinquent account in 2004.  His total debt is approximately $16,000.\n24\n25\nApplicant has a net monthly income of $1,800. His wife earns approximately $1,500 a month.\nAfter reported expenses, he has a small net remainder.  He has retirement savings. His wife budgets\n26\nand manages the bills. They are current on their rent and car note. Applicant\u2019s alleged debt in the\nSOR was $32,000. He has established with sufficient documentation that today the total debt has\nbeen significantly reduced.27\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n28\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to\ngenerate funds to meet financial obligations.\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as\nthose which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n29\n Id.\n30\n Id.\n31\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n32\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n33\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n34\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n35\n6\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n29\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n30\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n31\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.32\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\n33\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to\n34\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access\n35\nto sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nFinancial Considerations\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant has experienced difficulty meeting\nhis financial obligations since 1999. He filed for bankruptcy in 2002, and his indebtedness was\ndischarged by the bankruptcy court. This is a legally permissible mean of dealing with delinquent debt.\nCurrently, he has delinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $16,000. \n\n7\nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). Applicant's\nnumerous delinquent debts remain outstanding. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The\nbehavior was not recent), nor FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (The behavior was isolated) because he still carries\na significant amount of delinquent debt. \nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation)) applies. Applicant had periods of illness and temporary disability,\nand provided  evidence as to the effect on his finances. Moreover, his divorce and subsequent lengthy\ncustody proceedings created a significant amount of debt. Applicant provided  evidence to support this\nmitigating condition. Applicant\u2019s uneven pay history, ill health, divorce and custody issues are\nsufficient for mitigation in this case.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) partially applies.\nApplicant has satisfied several judgments and paid some accounts.  He has  taken steps to resolve these\ndebts. The record is devoid of any information concerning financial counseling.\nFC MC E2.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is applicable. Applicant has shown that he established a record of steady\npayments or financial stability when he was working. He made attempts to resolve the delinquent\naccounts, and continues to do so. He and his wife are both employed. I  conclude that he made a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his debts.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. Applicant is a married man with children and dependents at the current time. His debt\nresulted from unemployment and illness. He has a good work history. In this case, Applicant presented\nsufficient evidence of extenuation and mitigation to warrant a favorable decision. He has\nacknowledged a willingness to accept responsibility for his overdue accounts and has reduced his\ndelinquent debt. Applicant has met his burden. Based on the evidence in the record, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nEligibility is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Applicant failed to mitigate Guideline F\nsecurity concerns.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On October 26, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and Department\n1\nof Defense (DoD) Directive (Directive),  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the\n2\nbasis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), promulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications of SORs\nissued as of September 1, 2006, and thereafter.  With the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy\nof the Directive and the applicable Guidelines.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November\n7, 2006, and requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government\ncompiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 28, 2007.  The FORM contained documents\nidentified as Items 1 through 9.  By letter dated March 28, 2007, a copy of the FORM was forwarded\nto Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days\nof receipt.  Applicant received the file on April 3, 2007.  He filed additional information within the\nrequired time period.  Department Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s submission.  On May 2, 2007,\nthe case was assigned to me for a decision.  After a careful review of the record and Applicant\u2019s\nsubmission of additional information,  I admitted his one-page submission as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ex.)\nA.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains 19 allegations of disqualifying conduct under revised adjudicative Guideline\nF, Financial  Considerations.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.s.)  Applicant admitted 18 allegations and denied\none.  While he denied he owed the debt alleged at \u00b61.p., he stated he would pay it if he acquired the\naddress of the creditor.  (Item 3 at 5.)  Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact.\nApplicant is 55 years old, married, and the father of two adult children.  In 1970, Applicant\nenlisted in the U.S. Navy.  He was granted a security clearance in 1970.  He rose in the enlisted ranks\nand, by 1980, he had attained the rank of Chief Petty Officer (E-7).  In 1980, Applicant was\ncommissioned as an ensign.  He served as a Naval officer until 1991, when he retired as a Lieutenant\n(0-3).  (Item 4.) \n\n3\nFrom 1991 to 2003, Applicant was employed as a technical instructor by a community college.\nHe was unemployed from the end of December 2003 until July 2004.  In June 2004, he moved  to\nanother state to take the job he currently holds.  Since July 2004, he has been employed as an Engineer\nII by a defense contractor.  (Item 2; Item 4.)\nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies.  The SOR alleges Applicant owes and is\nresponsible for the following debts: a federal tax lien of approximately $28,895, entered against him\nin June 2003 for outstanding federal income tax owed for the years 1998 through 2000 (SOR\u00b6 1.a.);\nten accounts, totaling approximately $27,039, in collection status (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.i., 1.j.,\n1.n., 1.p., 1.r., and 1.s.); and eight charged off accounts, totaling approximately $19,818 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e.,\n1.g., 1.h., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.o., and 1.q.)  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all debts, with\nthe exception of a debt of $237, alleged at \u00b6 1.p.  However, he also indicated that while he didn\u2019t\nremember the debt alleged at \u00b6 1.p., he would make arrangements to pay it if he could acquire an\naddress for the creditor.  (Item 3 at 3, 5.)\nAmong Applicant\u2019s financial obligations are a voluntary repossession of an automobile, alleged\nat SOR \u00b6 1.k., a debt of approximately $5,765 in charged-off status.  Applicant stated he did not know\nhe was obliged to pay charged-off debts.  (Item 3 at 4.)  Applicant is also responsible for student loans\nof approximately $14,500, taken out for the educations of his son and daughter (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.i., and\n1.j.).  The student loans are paid by garnishments from his pay check.  (Item 3 at 5; Item 6 at 2.)\nIn a financial statement dated September 19, 2006, Applicant reported a net monthly salary of\napproximately $2,150.  He also reported he received approximately $1,906 in military retirement pay\neach month, resulting in a net monthly income of approximately $4,056.  Applicant listed $2,333 in\nfixed monthly expenses.  He reported wage garnishments of $700 monthly to the Internal Revenue\nService, $412 to his state taxing authority, and $334 to the holder of his children\u2019s education loans.\nWhen his living expenses and garnishments were subtracted from his monthly income, Applicant\nreported a net remainder of $276. (Item. 6 at 2, 4, 14.)\nIn mitigation, Applicant attributed his financial delinquencies to his unemployment from\nDecember 2003 to July 2004, his expenses in moving his household to another state to take on his\npresent job in July 2004, expenses he incurred in car repairs so he could drive his car on a military base\nwhere he was assigned to work, and his wife\u2019s health status, which prevents her from holding a job\nand contributing to the family income.  Applicant claimed his moving expenses were approximately\n$4,000 and his car repairs totaled approximately $2,700  (Item 3 at 4.)\nIn his answer to the SOR, dated November 6, 2006, Applicant stated he would pay some of his\ndebts in January and February of 2007.  Additionally, he requested he be given a grace period of six\nmonths to a year \u201cto get fully on top of [his] obligations.\u201d  (Item 3 at 5.)  Nothing in the record\nestablishes that Applicant has received credit counseling or has a plan in place to pay his creditors. \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant again requested more time to pay off his debts.  He\nstated he had not made arrangements to pay his delinquencies because he was uncertain his job would\ncontinue.  While he stated his son was paying the debt of approximately $31 alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h., he\nprovided no credible evidence to corroborate his statement.  (Ex. A)\n\n4\nApplicant executed  and signed a security clearance application (SF-86) on February 14, 2005.\nUnder the general remarks section of the SF-86, Applicant wrote:\nI was unemployed from 2003/12/31 until 2004/07/06.  So I was unable\nto keep up with my financial obligations. I am planning to bring all my\naccounts up to date now that I have a job, and continue to maintain\ncurrent status on delinquent accounts that are outstanding. \n(Item 4 at 9.)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[No one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive. \nBy Memorandum dated August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense directed\nimplementation of revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), promulgated December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006, as modified.\nThe revised AG replaced the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to DoD Directive 5220.6 and\nAppendix 8 to DoD 5200.2-R and apply to all adjudications and other determinations in which a SOR\nhad not been issued by September 1, 2006.  Accordingly, since the SOR in this case was issued\nOctober 26, 2006, the revised AG apply. \nThe revised AG set forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of\nan applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination\nas to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing\na clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \n\n Guideline F, \u00b6 19(a) reads: \u201cInability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d Guideline F, \u00b6 19(c) reads: \u201cA history\n3\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n5\nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2013Financial Considerations\nAn applicant\u2019s failure to live within his means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.  See Guideline F, \u00b6 18.\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was responsible for 19 delinquent debts in the amount\nof approximately $75,000, which had not been satisfied.  The allegations raised security concerns\nunder two Guideline F disqualifying conditions, \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   Applicant admitted responsibility\n3\nfor the financial delinquencies and provided no credible evidence that he did not owe the one debt he\ndenied.\nThrough Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence, the Government established that\nApplicant had a history of not meeting his financial obligations and was unable or unwilling to satisfy\nhis debts as specified in Guideline F, \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \nSeveral conditions could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s remaining\nfinancial delinquencies.  Unresolved financial delinquency might be resolved if it happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  (Guideline F, \u00b6\n20(a))  Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, such as loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  (Guideline F,\u00b6 20(b))  Still other mitigating\ncircumstances that might be applicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control  (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(c)) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(d)).\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged financial delinquencies are numerous, long-standing, and continue\nto the present day.  Applicant has failed to follow through on an assertion he made in February 2005\nthat he would pay his debts and achieve financial stability.  His financial delinquencies remain\nunresolved, suggesting that the circumstances that caused these delinquencies might occur in the\nfuture.  Accordingly, \u00b6 20(a) does not apply as a mitigating condition.  While Applicant\u2019s six-month\n\n6\nexperience of unemployment in late 2003 and early 2004 and his wife\u2019s illnesses were unfortunate,\nthese events do not of themselves establish that Applicant\u2019s unresolved financial delinquencies were\nlargely beyond his control or that he acted reasonably under the circumstances.  Nothing in the record\nsuggests Applicant contacted his creditors or otherwise gave them notice of his reduced financial\ncircumstances resulting from his job loss and his wife illness.  Nothing in the record suggests\nApplicant offered his creditors a plan to meet his obligations responsibly while in reduced\ncircumstances.  Accordingly, I conclude \u00b6 20(b) does not apply in mitigation under the facts of this\ncase.\nThe record does not show that Applicant sought financial counseling or that he was able on\nhis own to resolve or bring his financial delinquencies under control.  Accordingly, I conclude that \u00b6\n20(c) is inapplicable.  Applicant failed to provide evidence he had initiated a good-faith effort to pay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.  He did not submit evidence that he is timely meeting\nhis financial obligations.  Instead, he requested more time and made promises to resolve his financial\nproblems in the future.  Applicant made the same request on his SF-86 in February 2005.  At that time,\nhe stated he would bring his financial plans in order.  However, he failed to take any action as\npromised in the past two years.\nApplicant\u2019s promises to pay his creditors in the future were not persuasive.  Promises to take\nactions in the future are not a substitute for a documented track record of remedial actions.  ISCR Case\nNo. 98-0188 at 3 (April 29, 1999.)  In determining an individual\u2019s security worthiness, the\nGovernment cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant might resolve his or her outstanding debts\nat some future date.  ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999).  Accordingly, I find \u00b6 20(d)\ndoes not apply in mitigation in this case.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe revised AG and the Directive require that the adjudicative process in a security clearance\ncase not only assess conduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but it must also reflect a careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  The factors to be considered\nin a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  the extent to which participation\nis voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, the\nlikelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is a mature adult who has a history of financial over-extension.  He held a security\nclearance for many years as an enlisted man and as a Naval officer, and he was familiar with the\nGovernment\u2019s concern that failure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s history of not meeting his financial obligations and his inability to pay his debts\nraises a security concern because it suggests a lack of good faith.  Since he has not sought consumer\ncredit counseling or assistance in learning how to manage his finances, Applicant has failed to\ndemonstrate his delinquencies will not continue to be security concerns in the future.  He has made\n\n7\npromises to put his financial situation in order, but he has made no progress in the past two years in\ndoing so.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security\nclearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past\ntransgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common\nsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed,\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and\nomissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude Applicant\nshould not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the\nevidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department of Defense\nDirective, 5220.6., as amended.  I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.: Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.s.: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

As a  result of the 2004 DUI, he remains on probation until April 2008. He has a\nwell-established history of treatment for his alcohol problem followed by relapse. In addition, he\ndeliberately failed to disclose his 1983, 1988, and 1995 DUIs when he completed a security-\nclearance application in December 2004. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nDecember 8, 2006. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the\nfactual basis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline G for alcohol consumption\nand Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification). Applicant timely replied to the SOR and\nrequested a hearing. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or\nthereafter.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated December 8, 2006. The applicability of the\nRevised Guidelines was made a matter of record at the start of the hearing (R. 5). \nThe case was assigned to me February 5, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling\nthe hearing for February 27, 2007. Before the hearing was convened, Applicant, by counsel,\nrequested a continuance of the scheduled hearing and that request was granted. With the agreement\nof counsel, the hearing was rescheduled for April 11, 2007. On March 15, 2007, a notice of hearing\nwas issued for the agreed upon date. The hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript April 19, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nApplicant admits the five driving under the influence (DUI) offenses, he admits attending\noutpatient treatment during 2004\u20132005 and having a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, he denies\nattending inpatient treatment at a certain facility during 1995\u20131996, and he denies the allegation that\nhe provided a deliberately false answer in response to a question about his alcohol-related offenses\non a security-clearance application signed by him in December 2004. His admissions are\nincorporated herein. I make the following findings of fact set forth below in numbered paragraphs.\n1.\nApplicant is a 43-year-old computer scientist for a company engaged in federal contracting.\nHe married in 1998. His wife works as a retail manager. He has two stepchildren, a 21-year-old\ncollege student and a 17-year-old high school student. He served as a soldier on active duty in the\nArmy during 1985\u20131987, and then served in the reserves for four years until 1991, when he was\nhonorably discharged. \n2.\nFrom April 1988 to March 2001,  Applicant was employed by a large metals company. He\nlost that job when the company went out of business, and he was unemployed from March 2001 to\nJanuary 2004. During this period of unemployment, he went to college on a state-sponsored\nretraining program for individuals who lost jobs when the metals company went out of business. In\nAugust 2003, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration/management\ninformation systems. In January 2004, he worked as a research assistant at a local college. He was\nunemployed again from May 2004 until starting his current job in August 2004. The company\ndevelops software for the U.S. Army, and Applicant works as a quality assurance test manager. Also,\nhe serves as the office manager and lead technical support manager.  \n3.\nApplicant has a history of consuming alcohol, at times to excess or to the point of\nintoxication. He started drinking alcohol at about the age of 18 and his drinking increased steadily\nover time, although there were periods of abstinence. In the more recent years when he was drinking,\nhe would drink four to five nights per week and would drink to the point of intoxication two or three\ntimes per week (R. 76). His history of alcohol consumption includes being late to work, blackouts,\nand drinking in the morning (R. 77, 80, 81). His drinking has resulted in five alcohol-related\nincidents involving law enforcement, and each incident is discussed below.\n4.\nIn 1983, Applicant was charged with his first DUI. He was found guilty of the DUI offense,\nand his sentence included serving one day in jail and a fine of $355.\n5.\nIn 1988, he was charged with his second DUI. As a result, he received deferred prosecution\non the DUI charge.\n6.\nIn 1995, he was charged with his third DUI. The matter was disposed of in 1996 when he\nreceived deferred prosecution on the DUI charge. About two years later in 1998, the DUI charge was\ndismissed.\n7.\nIn 1997, he was charged with his fourth DUI in a neighboring state. The matter was disposed\nof in 1998 when he was found guilty of the DUI charge. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail (28 days\nsuspended), a fine of about $779, and was placed on probation for one year.\n8.\nOn January 19, 2004, he was charged with his fifth DUI. He pleaded guilty to the DUI charge\nin March 2004. The following month in April, he was found guilty and sentenced to 365 days of\n\n \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d\n3\n On this basis, I will enter a favorable finding for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.h.\n4\n4\nimprisonment (355 days suspended) and a fine of about $1,335. He was placed on supervised\nprobation for four years until April 2008, and placed on the DUI ignition interlock program for 12\nmonths. He was required to have an alcohol assessment, and he was ordered not to consume nor\npossess alcohol during probation. \n9.\nIn conjunction with his current employment, Applicant completed and signed a security-\nclearance application in December 2004 (Exhibit 1). In signing the application, he certified that his\nstatements were true, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and were made in good\nfaith. Also, he acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished under\nfederal law. In response to Question 24  about alcohol-related offenses, Applicant responded in the\n3\naffirmative and disclosed the 2004 DUI and the 1997 DUI. He did not disclose the other three DUIs.\nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant maintained that he did not intentionally falsify his application,\nand that  his omission of the three DUIs from 1983, 1988, and 1995 was due to a faulty memory (R.\n35\u201336, 47\u201348). \n10.\nApplicant has received treatment for his alcohol use on more than one occasion. The first\noccasion was after the 1988 DUI (R. 70\u201373). During this time he received a diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence. The treatment started as an intensive outpatient treatment program, but he had a relapse\nand then entered the inpatient treatment program for about 28 days. Thereafter, he was sober for\nabout two years until he resumed drinking in about 1990. The second occasion was after the 1995\nDUI. It is alleged that Applicant attended a certain inpatient treatment program, was diagnosed as\nalcohol dependent, and discontinued treatment before completing the program (SOR \u00b6 1.h and\nExhibit 5). Applicant explained that he contacted the treatment facility named in the SOR and asked\nthem to initiate the paperwork, but he continued to shop around. He found another treatment program\nand completed it instead (R. 45\u201347 and Exhibit H).  The third occasion was after the 1997 DUI. He\n4\nattended an outpatient program in 1998 and completed it in August 1998 (Exhibit G). \n11.\nThe fourth and most recent occasion was after the 2004 DUI when he participated in a one-\nyear program of intensive outpatient treatment (Exhibit 5). During this time he received a diagnosis\nof alcohol dependence. The program consisted of group sessions focused on education, processing,\nand monitoring. Applicant was an active participant in the sessions. He completed the program in\nNovember 2005 (Exhibits A and B), and he received a good prognosis if he continued to seek\nassistance through Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA).  \n \n12.\nApplicant has abstained from alcohol since his arrest in January 2004. His wife is essentially\na nondrinker and they do not have alcohol in their home. After completing treatment in November\n2005, Applicant did not attend AA until approximately February 2007, when be began attending at\nhis attorney\u2019s suggestion. Although initially motivated to obtain a security clearance, he has found\nAA very helpful by working the steps and having a sponsor (R. 78). It has helped alleviate his\ncraving for alcohol. He now regularly attends AA (Exhibit C), he is familiar with the 12-step\nprogram, and he is working on the first step. He admits that he has a problem with alcohol that he\ncannot solve by himself. Unlike the past, he no longer associates with the friends he used to drink\nbeer with to avoid the slippery situations that led him to relapse. Instead of drinking beer, he now\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n5\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

He acknowledges that his  decisions to drink and drive\nwere foolish and he offered no excuses (R. 87). After the 2004 DUI, he was able to obtain an\noccupational driver\u2019s license that allowed him to commute to his job. In October 2006, he obtained\na regular driver\u2019s license with an expiration date of April 2011.\n13.\nApplicant is a highly regarded and respected employee by people who work with him\n(Exhibits D, E, and F). None of these individuals have seen anything that suggests Applicant is\ncurrently drinking alcohol. \nPOLICIES\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n5\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n6\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n7\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n8\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n9\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.10\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n11\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n12\n6\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n11\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n12\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nThe Alcohol Consumption Security Concern\nUnder Guideline G, excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses. It can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s\nfive DUIs and his history of alcohol use and treatment or counseling for the same. First, his five\nDUIs qualify as alcohol-related incidents away from work within the meaning of the guideline.\nSecond, showing up late for work due to drinking the previous night (during his previous\nemployment) qualifies as alcohol-related incidents at work. Third, his history of alcohol consumption\nqualifies as habitual or binge drinking to the point of impaired judgment. Fourth, his repeated\ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence is also a concern under the guideline. And fifth, his well-established\nhistory of treatment followed by a return to drinking qualifies as a relapse after a diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. Taken together, these matters raise\na serious concern about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. \nI reviewed the MCs under the guideline and conclude he receives some credit in mitigation.\nEach MC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014does not apply. The record evidence\nshows a pattern of behavior resulting in adverse consequences, and the most recent was the 2004\nDUI, for which he is serving probation until April 2008. This pattern is not mitigated by passage of\ntime without recurrence, infrequency, or as an isolated incident. \nThe second MC\u2014the individual acknowledges his alcoholism, provides evidence of actions\ntaken, and has established a pattern of abstinence\u2014applies. Applicant admits that he has a problem\nwith alcohol and presented evidence that he is now working to overcome his problem by abstaining\nfrom alcohol (Exhibits 5, A\u2013F). He resumed attendance at AA in February 2007, has a sponsor, is\nworking the 12-step program, and is benefitting from it. He has abstained from alcohol since January\n\n7\n2004, after his fifth DUI arrest. Given these circumstances, he deserves credit in mitigation for his\nefforts.\nThe third MC\u2014the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program and has no history of previous treatment or relapse\u2014does not apply. Applicant\u2019s\nwell-established history of treatment followed by a return to drinking militates against applying this\nMC.     \nThe fourth MC\u2014the three-part reform and rehabilitation condition\u2014applies. First, Applicant\nsuccessfully completed his last course of treatment in November 2005 (Exhibits A and B). Second,\nhe has demonstrated a pattern of abstinence by not drinking since January 2004 and his attendance\nat AA since February 2007. And third, he received a good prognosis when he completed the\ntreatment program in November 2005 (Exhibit 5 at 1, 4). The credit is limited, however, given that\nhis attendance at AA is only a few months old, his good prognosis is not current, and his pattern of\nabstinence has likely been influenced by his court-ordered probation that requires him to refrain from\ndrinking and possessing alcohol. \nWeighing the disqualifying and mitigating information under the whole-person concept, the\nmain issue here can be framed as follows: Does Applicant\u2019s track record of abstinence  resolve the\nconcern that he will not relapse or backslide, as he has on previous occasions? Clearly, Applicant\nhas made good progress in addressing his alcohol problem, and he should be proud of his efforts. His\nabstinence since January 2004 and his recent participation in AA are indicators of success. He is also\nliving in an environment that supports his sobriety. But given his lengthy history of drunk driving,\nhis well-established history of treatment followed by relapse, and his status as a probationer until\nApril 2008, it is too soon to make a reliable determination about the potential for recurrence of\nsimilar conduct. What is needed here is a clear and established pattern of abstinence once he is no\nlonger under the court\u2019s supervision serving a sentence of probation. That would be persuasive and\nconvincing evidence that he is genuinely committed to abstinence. Accordingly, Guideline G is\ndecided against Applicant. \n2.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E addresses issues of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations. In this regard, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material\nfact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security\nclearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and\nwillfully. An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported.\nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 24 in his December 2004\nsecurity-clearance application. Applicant contends he did not list three of his five DUI offenses\nbecause he relied on a faulty memory when he completed the application. His explanation for not\ndisclosing the DUIs from 1983, 1988, and 1995 is not credible. It may be difficult to remember the\nspecific dates and details of his lengthy history of drunk driving, but given his history he had to know\nthat he had more than two DUIs. Although forgetting one of several  DUIs may be an honest mistake,\n\n8\nforgetting 60% of his drunk driving record is too much of a stretch. Accordingly, I conclude\nApplicant deliberately omitted or falsified material facts when he answered Question 24 by\nunderstating his history of alcohol-related offenses. In other words, his answer to Question 24 was\nat best a half-truth\u2014it was not a full, frank, and truthful answer. \nI reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. Making\nfalse statements to the federal government during the security-clearance process is serious\nmisconduct, and it is not easily explained away, extenuated, or mitigated. Accordingly, Guideline\nE is decided against Applicant.  \nIn conclusion, after weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I conclude that\nApplicant has failed to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Likewise, he did\nnot meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, I also considered Applicant\u2019s case under the whole-person concept, and my whole-\nperson analysis does not support approval of a clearance for Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline G:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph h:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
