On October 13, 2021, \nthe Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and detailed reasons why the DCSA \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a \ncontract with the DOD.

Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law have no \nconnection with the Tunisian government. (Item 7) \nAdministrative Notice \nTunisia is a constitutional republic with a multiparty, unicameral parliamentary \nsystem and a president with powers specified in the constitution. In 2019 the country held \nparliamentary and presidential elections in the first transition of power since its first \ndemocratic elections in 2014. In October 2019 the country held free and fair parliamentary \nelections that resulted in the Nahada Party winning a plurality of the votes, granting the \nparty the opportunity to form a new government. \nSignificant human rights issues exist in Tunisia including reports of unlawful or \narbitrary killings, primarily by terrorist groups; allegations of torture by government agents; \narbitrary arrests and detentions of suspects under antiterrorism or emergency laws; \nundue restrictions on freedom of expression and the press, including criminalization of \nlibel; widespread corruption, although the government took steps to combat it; societal \nviolence and threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and \nintersex persons; criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual conduct that resulted in \narrests and abuse by security forces; and the worst forms of child labor. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State continues to assess Tunisia at Level 4 (out of 4), \nwhich indicates that travelers should not travel to the country due to crime, civil unrest, \npoor health infrastructure, kidnapping, and arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d (Department of the Navy v.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) based on the heightened risk associated \nwith Tunisia and the potential conflict of interest that arises from his connection to them. \nA heightened risk is associated with Tunisia due to the continued repressive, \nauthoritarian, and anti-American regime which supports known terrorist groups. \nMoreover, violent crime, corruption, drug trafficking, and human-rights abuses are \nprevalent. Applicant bears the burden of persuasion to mitigate these concerns. (ISCR \nCase No. 99-0532 at 7 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6 8(a) is not \nestablished. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen, who served honorably in the U.S. military. He met his \nsecond wife while serving abroad.

She is a citizen of \nTunisia but is now a legal resident of the United States. He moved back to the United \nStates after his military career. They have a home. However, the record contains \ninsufficient facts to overcome the equally strong ties that he has to his wife\u2019s family in \nTunisia, who are at a heightened risk of coercion or pressure from a foreign government. \nUnder these circumstances, I cannot conclude that Applicant could be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s familial relationships are casual; nor is his contact with them \ninfrequent.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

Applicant \nwas divorced and his wife was to resolve some of the debts, but he did not act responsibly. \nHe blamed his ex-wife\u2019s financial mismanagement but failed to provide substantiating \ndocumentation to confirm his claim. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply as Applicant received no financial counseling \nor showed a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. He \npromises to pay his taxes but has not done so at the close of the record. \nApplicant disputed some of the reported delinquent accounts, but he failed to offer \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of delinquent debts he disputed. Other than \nhis general promise made to the OPM investigator in February-March 2020, he offered \nno indication that he intended to pay the bills or that he had made any efforts to do so \nsince receiving the SOR, even though he has held full-time employment. Thus, AG \u00b620 \n(e) does not apply. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant offered no evidence of a good-faith effort to \ncontact his creditors, engage in efforts to resolve any of his delinquent debts, or make \nany payments. Between the date he was interviewed by the OPM investigator in February \nMarch 2020, and the date his response to the FORM was expected, he made no claimed \nor verifiable efforts to address any of the delinquent debts. \nBased on the record, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. He has not acted responsibly by \nfailing to address his delinquent accounts while employed and by failing to make limited, \nif any, efforts of working with creditors.

ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her public trust position is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has failed to offer any evidence that he has even begun making \nsuch efforts even after the SOR was issued in October 2021. \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered \nno specifics regarding any repayment efforts; submitted no documentary evidence to \nreflect any payments made; and only made promises of proposed actions. Not one \ndelinquent debt has been resolved. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s inaction under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served honorably in the \nU.S. military. He provides for his family. He has an undergraduate degree and has worked \nfor defense contractors for many years. He is married to a citizen of Tunisia. His wife\u2019s \nfamily are citizens and residents of Tunisia. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.: \nAgainst Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.n.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of \npublic trust to support a contract with the DOD.

(GE 1; AE F; Tr. 13) He seeks a secret security \nclearance as a requirement of his continued employment. (GE 1; Tr. 13-14) He \npreviously held a clearance from approximately 2000 to 2005 while employed by a \nprevious defense contractor. (SOR Answer; GE 1) \nApplicant received his high school diploma in May 1994. He was awarded a \nBachelor of Science degree in engineering science in December 1998. Applicant was \nawarded a Master of Electrical Engineering degree in June 2003. He has received three \npatents and has three patents pending.

None of his drug use occurred while holding a security clearance. (GE 2) He \nfurther elaborated on his drug use in his January 29, 2021 SOR Answer as well as \nduring his testimony. The following summarizes that drug use. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout January 1996 to June 2019. During his testimony, Applicant clarified his past \nmarijuana use.

It\u2019s not part of my life.\u201d (Tr. 22-\n23, 28) \nApplicant does not use marijuana or cannabis-based products. His prior use was \nalways personal and recreational.

So no one would be anywhere near our house using \nmarijuana, or anything else illegal.\u201d (Tr. 24-25) Applicant does not associate with \nanyone who uses marijuana. (Tr. 44) \nApplicant stated that his marijuana use was never the result of a medical \nprescription, nor for self-medication. He has never been referred to drug counseling for \nhis past marijuana use. Applicant further stated that he does not now, nor has he ever, \nstruggled with addiction for any illegal substance, including cannabis. He has never had \na positive drug test. In his SOR Answer and during his hearing, Applicant submitted two \nseparate signed statements of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. (SOR Answer; AE B, AE K; Tr. 23-24, 29-30) Applicant \nsubmitted three negative drug tests, one test collected on January 25, 2021, and two \ntests collected on June 10, 2021.

(Tr. 30-31; AE H, AE L) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides one condition that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nThese proceedings were initiated after Applicant self-reported his history of drug \nuse on his September 20, 2019 SF-86, and later during his November 12, 2019 OPM \ninterview. These self-disclosures establish AG \u00b6 25(a). Further review is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find Applicant proved \nfull mitigation of security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd.

Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the \nrecency analysis, the Appeal Board stated:  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s last drug use was June 2019, about 24 months before his hearing \nand about six months before he self-reported his drug use on his SF-86. His marijuana \nuse occurred in college and intermittently and infrequently in the following years until he \nstopped completely in June 2019.

He recognizes the importance of being a responsible \nhusband and colleague, and that his actions can affect others. He also fully recognizes \nthat there is no room for any drug use while holding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nself-reflection, change in behavior, and support from his family, friends, and associates, \nnot to mention 24 months of abstinence, are indicative of an individual who wants to \nright his course. The absence of evidence of more recent or extensive drug use, and his \npromise not to use illegal drugs in the future, eliminates doubts about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to abstaining from illegal \ndrug use. In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board \nreversed an unfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge \nfailed to explain why drug use was not mitigated after the passage of more than six \nyears from the previous drug abuse. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists three ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has maintained a drug-free environment, achieved \nongoing personal growth, and changed his own life with respect to drug use. He does \nnot associate with anyone who uses marijuana, has made lifestyle changes, and has \nabstained from drug use for about 24 months with no problem in doing so. \nApplicant\u2019s letters of support from his wife, friends, and colleagues document that \nhe is an individual who possesses character and integrity. Applicant\u2019s work performance \nevaluation reflects the caliber of the contribution he is making as an employee. His \nperformance further reflects his work behavior is not indicative of someone with a drug \nproblem. As an employee and as a member of his community, he is viewed as reliable, \na constant learner, and an individual with integrity. At his hearing, Applicant \nacknowledged that future drug abuse is incompatible with his future career and family \nplans, and manifested a steadfast commitment to continue lifestyle changes consistent \nwith total abstinence of involvement with all illegal drugs. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, I did so after assessing his demeanor, overall \ncandor on other matters, and reputation among his superiors and peers. Given the \ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s background, his explanation for his actions, and his \nsubsequent behavior, I find credible his assertion that he will not use any illegal \nsubstance in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. Drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.

However, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant has been and is willing to maintain conduct expected of one entrusted \nwith a security clearance. He self-reported his drug use knowing that such disclosure \ncould jeopardize his clearance eligibility. I note that his drug use did not occur while he \nheld a clearance. Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred infrequently. He recognizes that it is not \nprudent to associate with anyone who uses drugs or place himself in such an \nenvironment where drugs are used. \nApplicant\u2019s employer, friends, and family support him. He has a history of stable \nemployment and a strong work ethic. This level of support and self-introspection should \nensure his continued success. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and \ncommitment to remaining free of illegal drug involvement. He has multiple indicators of a \nmature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. He was serious, candid, and \ncredible at the hearing. He appears to have cooperated fully and provided truthful \ninformation during the security clearance process and during his OPM PSI. He made a \ngood impression on me during the hearing. I believe Applicant has learned from this \nexperience, and is committed to remaining drug-free. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n8 \n Subparagraph 1.a: \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

She \nhas been working at temporary jobs. (Tr. 16-24, 58) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has five delinquent consumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.d and 1.n) totaling approximately $2,331; delinquent student loans totaling \napproximately $32,325 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.m); unfiled federal and state income tax \nreturns from tax year 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o-1.p) and a $244 state tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.q).  \nApplicant provided documents to corroborate that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($426) \nwas settled in September 2020; the debt in \u00b6 1.b ($142) was paid in January 2020; and \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($564) was settled in August 2019. These debts are resolved. (Tr. \n26; AE D, E, F) \nApplicant testified that sometime before December 2021, she was working with a \nperson who was helping her with her finances, but she lost faith in that person. So in \nDecember 2021, she began working with a credit specialist (CS) who gave her tips on \nbudgeting and tackling her financial problems. The service was free for the first 60 days \nand then she paid CS $99 a month until about two months ago. CS sent out letters to the \ncredit bureaus to dispute some of her debts. Applicant stated she has not received \nresponses regarding the disputed debts. (Tr. 30-32) \nApplicant denied the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($284).

It is not reflected on her 2021 and 2022 CBRs. (Tr. 27-29; GE 2, 3, \n4, 5) \nApplicant is disputing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($915). She admitted this debt in her \nanswer to the SOR, but testified that she never had an account with this cell phone \nprovider, so she disputed it. In her background investigation, she told the investigator that \nshe had not had an account with this creditor since 2017 and was unaware of the \ncollection account. She intended to contact the creditor and verify the accuracy of the \ndebt and pay it if it was accurate. Her two 2019, 2021, and 2022 CBRs reflect this debt \nas a charged-off account. She testified that CS is disputing this debt. Post-hearing, \nApplicant provided a copy of a credit report showing the account had been disputed and \ndeleted. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 32-34; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE H) \nApplicant testified that she funded her college education with student loans and \nworked part-time while attending college. In 2015, she stopped attending school and \ncould not afford to pay her student loans. She did not contact the lender to advise them \nof her status. (Tr. 19-22) \nIn January 2019, Applicant was interviewed by the government investigator and \nwas confronted with her delinquent student loans. After she stopped attending school in \n2015, she did not make any payments on her student loans. She disagreed with the debts \nbecause she had not received any correspondence that they were in collection. She said \nshe had three student loans and did not recall the name of the lender and had no \nknowledge the loans were from the Department of Education (DOE). She intended to \nobtain a copy of her credit report to determine who she needed to pay and then pay the \nloans if the information was correct. The debts are reflected as collection accounts in her \n2019 CBR and the loans were obtained from 2009 through 2012. She testified that it was \ndifficult to handle her student loans when she lost her job. (Tr. 35-40, 58-60; GE 3, 5) \nApplicant testified that she participated in a student loan rehabilitation program, \nwhere she was to pay $5 a month for a period of months. She stated she made the \npayments until the government placed the student loans in a deferred status. The record \nwas held open to allow Applicant an opportunity to provide the supporting documents to \nshow when she had applied for the rehabilitation program and that she was making the \nrequired monthly payments before the deferment. Post-hearing, she provided a copy of \nher request to the creditor from March 2021 to rehabilitate her student loans, copies of \nher monthly rehabilitation payments from March 2021 to August 2021, and a November \n2021, confirmation letter from the creditor advising her she had successfully rehabilitated \nthe loans. The loans are now deferred pursuant to the Government\u2019s moratorium on \nstudent loan payments. (Tr. 35-40; AE I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o, 1.p, and 1.q alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her 2019 federal \nand state income tax returns and she owed past-due state income taxes ($244) for tax \nyear 2017.

She did not receive a W-2 income statement from \none of her employers, which caused a problem of unreported income. She stated that she \nfiled her 2019 returns when she completed her 2020 returns. She received a refund for \n2020 tax year. She provided unsigned copies of her 2019 federal and state tax returns \nindicating they were completed by a professional tax preparer. Her 2019 federal income \ntax return showed that she owed $722 in federal income taxes and $104 for state income \ntax. There was also an electronically completed voucher for the amount to be paid to the \nIRS that was included with the return. (GE 2; Tr. 40-56; AE A, B) \nApplicant provided a letter from the Department of the Treasury from April 2021, \nthat showed a portion of her refund was applied to a state tax obligation. Presumably, this \nrefund was from her 2020 federal taxes and satisfied her 2017 state tax debt. Post-\nhearing, Applicant stated in her email that she verified with the IRS that her 2019 tax \nreturn was not filed. She contacted her tax preparer who told her that her 2019 tax returns \nwere mailed. Applicant said she advised the tax preparer that the IRS tax transcripts for \n2019, reflected the returns were not filed. The tax preparer told her that she would mail \nApplicant a copy of the 2019 tax returns to sign and mail. Applicant stated that she had \nreached out several times to the tax preparer, but was unable to connect with her. At the \nclose of the record, she had not yet received the tax returns that were presumably in the \nmail. (Tr. 40-56) \nAt her hearing, Applicant provided a copy of her 2019 federal and state tax returns \nas exhibits. The tax preparer\u2019s name and identification number were on the copies. The \ncopies were unsigned by Applicant. Also included with the tax exhibits were copies of \nelectronically prepared payment vouchers with Applicant\u2019s name and address and the \naddress of the IRS and state tax authority where they should be mailed. It is unknown \nwhy Applicant has not signed her copy of the tax documents and mailed them. Applicant \nprovided a copy of a letter from the IRS indicating that on July 26, 2022, it had received \na request for verification of non-filing for tax year 2019. The letter confirmed that there \nwas no record that Applicant\u2019s 2019 federal tax return had been filed. The evidence does \nnot support that her 2019 federal and state tax have been filed. (Tr. 40-56; GE 2; AE A, \nB, C, G, L, Q) \nApplicant attributes her financial issues to being underemployed. She stopped \nattending college when she had her daughter. She moved in with her parents. She was \nworking at a state office for about seven years and was only earning about $8 an hour. \nShe is working at a temporary job now and earning $15 an hour. She has no extra money \nat the end of the month after paying her expenses. She does not have a budget. (Tr. 61-\n65 \nApplicant\u2019s August 2021 and June 2022 CBRs reflect that she has a new \ndelinquent debt for unpaid insurance for $52 that was not alleged in the SOR. It was first \nreported delinquent in July 2021. There is a second delinquent debt reported in the June \n2022 CRB that is reflected as a charged-off account for $2,759 that was opened in June \n2020, and the last payment made was June 2021.

In her technical role, CS does not provide \nbudgeting and financial management services, but did try to assist Applicant with some \nfinancial advice. CS disputed items on Applicant\u2019s credit report that did not belong to her \nor had an inaccurate amount reported. She advised Applicant how credit cards worked. \n(Tr. 70-78) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant has debts and student loans that have been delinquent or in collection \nfor years. She failed to file her 2019 federal and state tax returns and owed taxes to her \nstate for tax year 2017. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant attributes her financial issues to being underemployed. She paid the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c before receiving the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndebts. She attempted to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but was unable to determine the \nmedical creditor. She disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n because she did not believe it was \nvalid, and it was deleted from her credit report. I find AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to these two \ndebts. Applicant did not begin to address her delinquent student loans until after receiving \nthe SOR. She began a rehabilitation program in March 2021 and consistently made the \n$5 monthly payments, and the loans are no longer in default. Payments on the loans are \ndeferred under the Government\u2019s moratorium. I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) only partially applies \nbecause she delayed years before addressing her student loans and did not take action \nuntil after receiving the SOR. However, I give her credit for rehabilitating the loans. \nApplicant testified that she delayed filing her 2019 federal and state tax returns \nbecause she was missing a W-2 and wanted a professional to prepare her returns. She \nbelieved her tax preparer had filed her 2019 returns with her 2020 returns. It appears she \nreceived a refund from her 2020 federal tax returns, which was applied to her state tax \ndebt. Applicant verified through the IRS that her 2019 federal taxes are not filed. She has \ncorresponded with her tax preparer to resolve the matter, and she said she was waiting \nfor a copy of the return so she could file it. Applicant has copies of her 2019 federal and \nstate tax returns, which she provided as exhibits (AE A, B), and a copy of a voucher to \npay $722 for her federal taxes and $104 for her state taxes. It is unknown why she has \nnot signed them and mailed them. Applicant was put on notice when she received the \nSOR that her 2019 federal and state income tax returns were not filed. At this juncture \nthey still are not filed. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. The state tax debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q is \nresolved. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to years of underemployment. She has \nmade progress in resolving her delinquent debts, including a few before she received the \nSOR. She did not begin to address her student loans until after she received the SOR, \nbut made the $5 monthly payments and the loans are rehabilitated. Applicant testified \nthat she has no money left over at the end of the month. She does not have a budget. \nDespite being put on notice with the SOR in February 2021 that her 2019 federal and \nstate income tax returns were not filed, they remain unfiled. She provided copies of her \ncompleted 2019 tax returns, which reflected the amounts she owed for both federal ($722) \nand state ($104) taxes, but has not mailed them to the IRS or her state tax authority. She \ndid not contact her tax preparer until after her hearing. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant does not have a reliable financial track record, she continued to \naccumulate delinquent debts after the SOR and has failed to file her 2019 tax returns. At \nthis juncture, it is too early to conclude that her financial issues are no longer a security \nconcern. Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.q:  \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Once he became aware of collection efforts against him in 2018, he confronted \nhis spouse and learned of the extent of their financial problems. He immediately informed \nhis FSO and sought help from more experienced coworkers and an attorney.

Applicant has used the resources available to him to resolve accounts, \nhas obtained financial counseling, and has a current budget with a positive net monthly \nremainder. I find that Appellant\u2019s financial issues no longer cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has overcome his financial problems \nand additional delinquencies are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), (c), and (d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s education, employment history, spouse\u2019s medical condition, and efforts to \nresolve debts. Applicant has shown a recent history of ability, intent, and desire to meet \nhis financial obligations in the future. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n6 \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n:  \n\n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old engineering technician employed by a defense \ncontractor since November 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from \nFebruary 2012 to October 2017. He received a security clearance in December 2011, in \npreparation for entrance into the Navy nuclear propulsion program. He married on \nSeptember 2016 and has a two-year-old son and an eight-year-old stepson. \nApplicant completed his first enlistment in the Navy without incident, received an \nhonorable discharge, and immediately reenlisted. He received nonjudicial punishment in \nFebruary 2013 for smoking an electronic cigarette in the engine room, which was a \nrestricted area. He was reduced one pay grade (suspended), and restricted to the ship \nfor 30 days. At the time, he was responsible for supervising up to seven junior technicians. \n(AX J; Tr. 37.) After receiving nonjudicial punishment, he was removed from his \nsupervisory position. \nSmoking in the engine room was a common practice. Applicant admitted that he \nshould have enforced the rule against smoking in the area. Instead, he joined the smokers \nin the practice. He believes that an incoming new chain of command punished him to set \nthe example and make it clear that violation of the no-smoking rule would not be tolerated \nany longer. (Tr. 15.) \nApplicant attended a party with a group of friends in August 2017 and joined them \nin smoking marijuana that was being passed around. He tested positive in a random \nurinalysis, and he received nonjudicial punishment for drug use. He attributed his use of \nmarijuana to being depressed after being removed from a supervisory position. (GX 3 at \n5.)

His wife had a difficult pregnancy and was unable to continue working outside the \nhome.

In an enhanced subject interview (ESI) in January 2020, Applicant told an \ninvestigator that this debt was a line of credit that he used to cover multiple debts after he \nwas discharged from the Navy. (GX 3 at 11.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that it \nwas a joint credit-card account that he opened to enable his wife to establish credit.

This debt is a recoupment of Applicant\u2019s reenlistment bonus as a result of his \npremature discharge for misconduct. He had a payment plan providing for monthly $50 \npayments for one year, but after the one-year plan expired, the monthly payments \nincreased to about $1,000 per month. Starting in February 2019, his pay was garnished \nfor $250 twice a month to repay the debt. (GX 3 at 13.)

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand, except for the reenlistment bonus that is being recouped, were not incurred under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. All of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were triggered by \nhis premature discharge from the Navy for misconduct. Although the discharge was a \ncondition beyond his control, it was caused by his intentional misconduct, which was \nwithin his control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has completed the financial counseling \nrequired by the bankruptcy court, but he has not resolved any of his delinquent debts, \nand he has not filed his bankruptcy petition. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Except for the repayment plan for his reenlistment \nbonus, Applicant has not initiated any payment arrangements and has not yet filed his \nbankruptcy petition. The repayment of the reenlistment bonus was being collected by \ninvoluntary garnishment until collection was deferred because of COVID-19. Payment by \ninvoluntary garnishment is not a \u201cgood-faith\u201d means of paying a debt. ISCR Case No. 09-\n05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was a one\u00ad\ntime incident that occurred more than three years ago. He lives in a different environment \nand no longer associates with his former shipmates or the persons with whom he smoked \nmarijuana.

The security concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nor sensitive information. . . .\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the \nhearing establishes the following disqualifying condition: \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt \nupon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nAll three mitigating conditions are established for the reasons set out above in the \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, H, \nand E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement and \npersonal conduct, but he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drugs): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The Applicant offered eleven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A \nthrough K, which was admitted without objection.

He has a Bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in Electrical Engineering. He holds the position of Test Engineer. He is seeking \nto obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nFrom 1998 through 2001, while in high school, Applicant used marijuana. He \nbegan using it experimentally, but it soon became a recreational habit. \nAfter high \nschool, in 2002, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. Applicant served on active duty \nfrom November 2002 to November 2008. In 2002, he applied for and was granted a \nsecurity clearance. He used marijuana and other illegal drugs on numerous occasions \nwhile in the Air Force. In 2002, Applicant did not disclose his illegal drug use on his \nsecurity clearance application. Applicant testified that a friend who served in the military \ntold him not to. (Tr. p. 12.) From November 2008 to November 2014, Applicant served \nin the Air National Guard.  (Tr. p. 31.) \nWhile on active duty with the Air Force, and after being granted a Top Secret \nsecurity clearance, Applicant used a variety of illegal drugs including marijuana, \ncocaine, and prescription medication such as Vicodin, Percocet, and Rohypnol (not \nprescribed to him), Ecstacy, and Methamphetamine. Applicant used cocaine from 1999 \nthrough 2019 with varying frequency, and at times while granted access to classified \ninformation. He used prescription medication, not prescribed to him, from 2001 to 2011, \nat times while granted access to classified information. \nHe used Ecstacy and \nMethamphetamines in 2009, while granted access to classified information. \nIn 2009, while serving in the Air National Guard, Applicant was pulled over and \ncited for possession of marijuana. Applicant did not tell the military about this citation \nand apparently, they were not notified about it. Applicant continued to use marijuana. A \nfew months later, in 2010, Applicant was cited again for possession of marijuana. This \ntime, the military was officially notified about this citation. \nApplicant lied to his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nsupervisor or first sergeant, who was filling in for the commander at the time, and told \nhim that the marijuana found in his car during his June 2009 citation belonged to his \ncousin, and that he did not smoke marijuana. This was a lie. The marijuana was the \nApplicant\u2019s, and he had used it at the time. Applicant\u2019s punishment for this offense was \nonly given a verbal and written reprimand. \nApplicant was later asked by the \ncommander about the incident, and Applicant admitted to possession of the marijuana, \nbut did not tell him that he was smoking the marijuana or that it was his marijuana. \nApplicant told the commander only enough to get out of the situation. (Tr. pp. 29-30.) \nAt the end of his commitment term, Applicant wanted to re-enlist, but was told that he \nwas unable to do so given his history of drug use. Apparently the police reports of the \ntwo citations for possession of marijuana disclosed that Applicant had been using \nmarijuana and that it was his marijuana. This information was not timely reported to the \nmilitary legal department and so Applicant slipped through the cracks and was able to \nfinish his military commitment without interruption. Concerning the possession charges \nin 2009 and 2010, the court offered the Applicant a diversion program that required him \nto complete mandatory drug treatment programs, and the charges were dismissed. \nApplicant has completed substance abuse education and counseling ordered by the \ncourt as a result of his possession charges.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I.) \nIn 2014, with the commander\u2019s discretion, Applicant was given an honorable \ndischarge with a stipulation that prevents him from ever re-enlisting in military service \nagain. (Tr. pp. 39-40.) \nAfter leaving military service, Applicant continued to use marijuana. He last used \nmarijuana in 2019 with a friend, and another time that year he used it with his brother. \nApplicant began his current employment in October 2018. On July 11, 2019, \nApplicant completed a security clearance application. \nIn response to Section 23, \nconcerning Illegal Drug Activity, the question asked, \u201cIn the last seven years, have you \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substance? Have you EVER illegally used or \notherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a \nsecurity clearance other than previously listed?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d to both \nquestions. (Government Exhibit 1.) Applicant\u2019s answer was false to both questions. \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his history of illegal drug use discussed above. \nApplicant states that he has not used any illegal drugs since 2020. (Tr. p. 53.) \nHe states that he is a changed man who has greatly matured. He is taking positive \nsteps to eliminate the chances that would place him in a situation where he would be \ncompelled to use illegal drugs. He no longer associates with drug users or puts himself \nin those environments. \nIn February 2013, Applicant got married. His wife does not use illegal drugs. He \nnow has children who are depending on him to provide, and be reliable and sober-\nminded, and to be available physically, mentally, and spiritually every day.  (Tr. p. 63.) \nApplicant testified that from 2010 to 2015, although he was using illegal drugs, he \nfinished college and obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree.

He has \nalso attended mandatory MADD meetings and substance abuse courses. (Tr. pp. 66.) \nApplicant\u2019s military performance reports during the period from November 19, \n2002, to July 15, 2004; July 16, 2004, to July 15, 2005; and July 16, 2005 to July 15, \n2006, reflects superior performance in all areas. From July 16, 2006 to July 15, 2007, \nthe performance reports show a remarkable decline in work performance. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit F.) \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluation for the period from January 2, 2020, to June \n30, 2020, reflects an overall rating of \u201cexcellent performer.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \nLetters of recommendation from former colleagues, friends, and family of the \nApplicant described Applicant as a dedicated employee, a trusted leader, respected by \nall, highly motivated, honest and responsible. At work, he has helped develop training \nmaterial and provide mentorship for new members of the team. When the technical \nmanager was away, Applicant was called upon to be the leader. \nApplicant is \nprofessional, and is committed to self-improvement.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \nApplicant has received a number of awards and commendations for his service in \nthe military.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \nApplicant underwent a voluntary drug test on September 8, 2021.  The results \nare negative for any illegal drugs.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n         \n \n \n      \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant used marijuana and \nother illegal drugs over at least a seventeen-year period, from 2002 to about 2019, at \ntimes, while possessing a security clearance. Applicant states that he is no longer \nusing marijuana. His actions are not mitigated. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; and \n(d) \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a while-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of; \n(2) any disruptive, violent or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 17 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One of the conditions is potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant has completed several court-ordered substance abuse programs as \npart of his diversion program in order to have his two drug possession charges \ndismissed. However, even after completing these programs, he continued to abuse \nillegal drugs. Applicant has engaged in poor personal conduct that reflects unreliability \nand untrustworthiness. \nFrom 1998 to 2020, he used a variety of illegal drugs \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(discussed in detail above) on various occasions over a period of at least twenty-two \nyears. In 2009 and again in 2010, he was cited for possession of marijuana, and lied \nabout it to military superiors. He lied on two separate security clearance applications in \nan effort to conceal his illegal drug history. Finally, he has used illegal drugs while \npossessing a security clearance. Illegal drug use is against Federal law. It is not \ntolerated by DoD policies. \nApplicant understands that illegal drug use is clearly \nprohibited while holding a security clearance. \nHis conduct shows poor judgment, \nunreliability and untrustworthiness. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live his life to his \nconvenience, and has disregarded the law. Knowing that the use of any illegal drug is \nagainst DoD policy. He also lied to military officials during his time in service regarding \nhis drug involvement, and he has falsified two security clearance applications. \nApplicant has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment. \nUnder the \nparticular facts of this case, Applicant does not show the requisite character or judgment \nof someone who has the maturity, integrity, and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. At this time, Applicant does not meet the eligibility qualifications for a \nsecurity clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security \nclearance is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated the level of maturity needed for access to classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant understands the requirements associated with holding a security clearance \nand knows that illegal drug use is not tolerated. Applicant is not an individual in whom \nthe Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. Applicant does not \nmeet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He \nrefused to do so without explanation as to why he was being removed. Applicant did \nnot understand why he was being removed. He states that upon his return to the United \nStates, he was able to read the e-mail in its entirety for the first time, and realized that \nthe text was written in Arabic in a very hateful, resentful and threatening language \ntoward the United States, its Army, and its citizens. Applicant was terminated from an \nIntelligence Agency contractor for forwarding this e-mail containing hateful and \nthreatening language toward the U.S. and its citizens. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n1.a. From October 2013 to November 2015, Applicant worked as a Healthcare \nInterpreter for a clinic. While working for this employer, Applicant was investigated for \nsending inappropriate images and texts to other Arabic-speaking employees. The text \nstated, \u201cThis prayer to Allah to take revenge on each and everyone (sic) of Islam\u2019s \nenemies and wishing the most severe torture and punishment on them in this life and \nalso the other life hereafter.\u201d Applicant was investigated for this misconduct and found \nculpable. Applicant stated that the content of the text also included a picture of an adult \nstanding on the neck and private area of an infant. The caption above it stated in \nArabic\u2026\u201cthe Muslim children of Burma, their only guilt is that they are Muslims\u201d. The \nApplicant then added his personal comments, stating in Arabic, (sic) \u201c ALLh/God is our \nsavior and upon him we depend, to ALLh we belong and to Him we shall return, and no \nmight nor power except that by ALLh, Dear God Who Is ALL Powerful, Mighty, \nVengeful, Great, Just, True and the One and Only, we ask You by Your Glourious \nname, to make us witness your amazing power and fierce torment against all those who \nare the enemies of Islam, soon not later, in this life and the Hereafter. And to give glory \nto Islam and Muslims, Amen.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nApplicant does not believe that his comments targeted anyone specifically, nor \ndid it express hate, harm or a threat to anyone. He believes that the text was taken out \nof context and given the wrong and unintended meaning. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nWhile working for the same employer, Applicant was also investigated for \nmisusing the time clock. On a number of occasions, Applicant would clock into work \nand then leave to park his car. Applicant was either suspended or terminated in about \nNovember 2015, for time card fraud. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) Applicant states \nthat his corrective action for his time card fraud was a suspension from work from \nNovember 4, 2015 to November 9, 2015. (Government Exhibit 5.) He believes that his \nemployment ended from the company for violating company policy, namely for working \noff the clock. Applicant stated that after working his regular scheduled hours, he would \nat times, clock out and continue working, to complete pending work and urgent \ntransactions, which he found was against company policy. Applicant states that he was \nnot compensated for this work. He states that he did not know that he was doing \nanything wrong. He states that the reason he was working off the clock was to avoid \nputting in for over-time and to help his department keep expenses down.

During his interview with the OPM investigator on March 2019, Applicant admitted \nto using fictitious dates of birth when using various dating websites like Match.com., \ndespite being married. His wife is unaware of his propensity for visiting dating websites. \n(Government Exhibit 4.) \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \nApplicant has close ties with several family members who reside in Saudi Arabia. \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen of Jordan and a resident of Saudi Arabia. His sister is a \ncitizen and resident of Saudi Arabia. His mother-in-law was a citizen of Egypt and a \nresident of Saudi Arabia. His brother-on-law is a citizen of Canada and a resident of \nSaudi Arabia. \nApplicant states that he is loyal and dedicated to the United States. He states \nthat his relatives in Saudi Arabia are normal middle-class citizens with no government \naffiliations. He states that he has no communication of any sort with one of his brother \nsince 2003, as they are no longer on good terms due to financial disputes. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A.)  However, Applicant has another brother, who used to live in Jordan, but now \nlives in Saudi Arabia. Applicant has weekly communication with him via text message \nusing the social media application, What\u2019s App. This brother works as a computer \nsoftware consultant. (Government Exhibit 4.) Applicant also maintains regular contact \nwith his sister in Saudi Arabia, via text message by using What\u2019s App. (Government \nExhibit 4.) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is deceased and does not pose a security risk. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nSince Applicant still maintains regular contact with his sister, a brother, and his \nbrother-in-law, who reside in Saudi Arabia, it is assumed that he has feelings of \naffection and obligation to them. The conditions in Saudi Arabia are unpredictable and \noften volatile and dangerous. Given Applicant\u2019s past behavior, where his character has \nbattled some conflict with what is going on in Saudi Arabia and the reaction of the \nUnited States, these foreign contacts may pose a risk to the national security. \nNotice \nI have taken administrative notice of the following information concerning the \ncountry of Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by King \nSalman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who is both head of state and head of government. The \n1992 Basic Law sets out the system of governance, rights of citizens, and powers and \nduties of the government, and it provides that the Quran and Sunna (the traditions of the \nProphet Muhammad) serve as the country\u2019s constitution. The U.S. Department of State \nhas issued a Level 4 Travel advisory to warn travelers not to travel to Saudi Arabia due \nto the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian facilities perpetrated by Iran and \nIran-supported militant groups.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of; \n(2) any disruptive, violent or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant has exhibited a pattern and practice of questionable judgment \ndemonstrated by the serious nature of the language and texts (emails) that he has \nsent to fellow Muslims and to U.S. citizens in the workplace. On more than one \noccasion he has emailed hateful, threatening, or inappropriate text messages to fellow \nemployees about the U.S. to express his dissatisfaction with various events. \nIn 2015, he engaged in similar conduct, when he sent a prayer text threatening \nto take revenge on Islam\u2019s enemies. \nApplicant has attempted to share negative \nthreatening messages towards the U.S. or toward non-Muslims when he is \ndiscouraged about an event involving Islam. \nIn addition, during his interview with OPM in March 2019, Applicant revealed \nthat he uses a fictitious birth date on dating websites, despite the fact that he is \nmarried. Applicant\u2019s wife is unaware of his propensity for visiting dating websites. \nMost concerning overall is the fact that Applicant does not realize the seriousness of \nhis actions. He has downplayed his behavior. His inappropriate conduct is very \nconcerning, and shows poor judgment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere are conditions mitigating security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. However, \nnone of them are applicable here: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with person involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct demonstrates poor judgment. The serious nature \nof the language raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness. Applicant engaged in this conduct in the United States and in foreign \ncountries without concern or regard for the fact that he possessed a DoD security \nclearance. Any doubt about a person\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information will \nbe resolved in favor of national security. The before-mentioned disqualifying conditions \nhave been established and are not mitigated. \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is deceased and does not pose a security risk. \nHowever, his sister, brother, and brother-in-law are currently residents of Saudi Arabia. \nIt is presumed that Applicant maintains contact with them on some level, since he is \naware that his sister now has children and grandchildren. (Applicant\u2019s Response to the \nFORM.) Given the unpredictable nature and conditions that exist and continue in Saudi \nArabia, involving the terrorist activities and other human rights violations that are \nprevalent, a heightened risk of exploitation, coercion, and/or duress exists. Applicant\u2019s \nties to his family there may pose a heightened security risk for the United States \nGovernment. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group,\ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest; and \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family ties in Saudi Arabia raises a prima facie security \nconcern that requires the applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or \nmitigation sufficient to meet the burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.  Thus, Applicant bears \nthe burden to establish that his relatives are not vulnerable to influence, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. In this case, Applicant has not met his burden. From the \nevidence presented, Applicant maintains a close and continuing relationship with his \nsister, a brother, and his brother-in-law. These foreign ties could potentially place the \nApplicant in a compromising position and pose a risk to the United States. \nGiven his conduct in the past, it is not clear nor can it be presumed that \nApplicant will continue to place the interest of the U.S. paramount, and always protect \nthe U.S. from any risk of terrorism, and/or any situation that could place the interests of \nthe U.S. in jeopardy. Under the circumstances, Applicant has not met his burden and \nhas not established the mitigating conditions set forth above under Guideline B. \nAccordingly, this guideline is found against the Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and B in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Personal Conduct and Foreign Influence \nsecurity concerns. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR alleged facts that raise security concerns articulated in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Specifically, this case concerns \nsecurity concerns outlined under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on April 8, 2022. On May 17, 2022, I scheduled this case to be \nheard remotely using a video conferencing platform on June 29, 2022. The parties \nappeared as scheduled. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 8, 2022. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. GX 1 \u2013 3 were \nadmitted without objection. GX 4 presented the Government\u2019s request that I take \nadministrative notice of information about Kosovo, the country at issue in this case. I \ngranted that request and have considered herein the information provided in GX 4 as \nappropriate. Appellant appeared as scheduled and testified, but he did not present any \ndocumentary information. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s wife (SOR 1.a), children (SOR 1.b), parents \n(SOR 1.c), and siblings (SOR 1.f) are citizens and residents of Kosovo. The SOR also \nalleged that Applicant\u2019s best friend and his friend\u2019s wife (SOR 1.g), a sister-in-law (SOR \n1.h), two childhood friends (SOR 1.i), and a niece (SOR 1.j) are all citizens and residents \nof Kosovo. \nFurther, the SOR alleged that between October 2007 and November 2015, \nApplicant resided at a U.S. military installation in Kosovo as part of his employment with \na U.S. defense contractor, and that he maintained regular contact with his wife and \nchildren and other family members who were living in Kosovo during that period (SOR \n1.d). Additionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant, his wife and his children, have lived in \nKosovo with his parents since November 2015 (SOR 1.e). \nFinally, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s wife maintains a bank account in Kosovo \nwith a balance of about $12,000, which Applicant provided (SOR 1.k); and that Applicant \nowns three properties in Kosovo with an approximate total value of $180,000 (SOR 1.l). \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts established \nby Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. When he was born, Serbia, formerly a part of the now-\ndissolved Yugoslavia, controlled the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, where he and his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfamily and friends all lived. When Kosovo declared independence in 2008, Applicant \nbecame a citizen of the newly-formed nation of Kosovo; however, he was always a citizen \nof Kosovo as it existed before the Kosovo War of 1998 \u2013 1999 and subsequent \nindependence from Serbia. He was raised and educated in Kosovo through his high \nschool graduation in 1999. Between June and December 2002, he worked as a linguist \nfor a U.S. defense contractor in support of U.S. forces operating as part of a NATO \ncoalition put in place after the Kosovo War ended in 1999. (GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 27 \u2013 28) \nIn December 2002, at age 21, Applicant traveled to the United States on a tourist \nvisa. During that visit, he met a woman who was a U.S. citizen and they decided to get \nmarried. They arranged to be married in June 2003 before his tourist visa expired and he \nwould be forced to return to Kosovo, and either obtain a new tourist visa or apply for entry \nto the United States for different reasons. After his marriage, he obtained permanent \nresident status in the United States by virtue of his marriage to a U.S. citizen. (GX 1; GX \n2; GX 3; Tr. 28 \u2013 29) \nApplicant joined the U.S. Army on January 13, 2004. The following day, he and his \nAmerican wife finalized their divorce. Applicant claims she did not want to move to his \nduty station in another state or to be married to someone who would have to move a lot \nfor military assignments. He served as an airborne infantryman and deployed on multiple \ncombat missions in the Middle East. By serving on active duty in the U.S. military, \nApplicant was able to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, which he did in October 2004. \nHe received a security clearance in March 2007, and he was honorably discharged in \nSeptember 2007. (GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 11 \u2013 12, 29 \u2013 32) \nTwo months after his discharge, Applicant returned to Kosovo. In 2007, he found \nemployment there for the next eight years as a linguist with two U.S. defense contractors \nsupporting the ongoing U.S. military mission. He later was promoted to a management \nposition involving physical security requirements for the U.S. military installation in \nKosovo that was his job site. He worked in that capacity in Kosovo until 2015, when the \ncontract ended. During his employment, Applicant had access to classified information \nbased on the security clearance he held in the Army. The record does not contain a \nreapplication for clearance between his 2007 discharge and the February 2019 \napplication that is being sponsored by his new employer. (GX 1; GX 2; GX 3) \nApplicant remarried in April 2006 and has two children. His current wife is a citizen \nresident of Kosovo. She has since been granted permanent resident status in the United \nStates. Except for visits to Applicant\u2019s duty station in the United States, she has stayed in \nKosovo since 2006, including while Applicant completed the last of his combat \ndeployments to the Middle East before his discharge in 2007. His two children, now ages \n8 and 13, were born in Kosovo after Applicant was discharged from the Army. (Answer; \nGX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 33 \u2013 35) \nBecause Applicant\u2019s children were born abroad to a U.S. citizen, they were eligible \nfor U.S. citizenship at birth, their status being derived from Applicant\u2019s U.S. citizenship. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, they could not immediately receive U.S. citizenship because Applicant had not \nbeen physically present in the United States for five years before they were born. Thus, \nhe was required first to establish their Kosovo citizenship (he obtained Kosovo passports \nfor them), then obtain immigrant visas for each child and apply for their naturalization after \nthe family returned to the United States, which they did in August 2020. The children are \nnow dual citizens of the United States and Kosovo. (GX 1; Tr. 38 \u2013 39; see also 8 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1401(g)) \nBetween 2007 and 2015, Applicant lived at the military facility in Kosovo that was \nhis job site. His family remained at their home in Kosovo and Applicant was able to see \nthem periodically during scheduled time off. This was required by the terms of his \nemployment because he was on call at all times. In January 2019, he was hired by \nanother U.S. defense contractor for work as a linguist at the same facility in Kosovo. His \nemployment is contingent on his renewed eligibility for a security clearance. He testified \nthat if he does not qualify for employment as a contractor in Kosovo, he will take his family \nback to the United States to find work. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 11 \u2013 12, 53 \u2013 54) \nAfter leaving his job in 2015, Applicant remained in Kosovo with his wife and \nchildren. He did not seek further work, choosing instead to be a stay-at-home father in \nKosovo between 2015 and 2020 while his wife completed her college studies in Kosovo. \nIn August 2020, after he had received the SOR and became uncertain about whether he \nwould be able work as a linguist in Kosovo, Applicant and his family moved back to the \nUnited States where they rented a place to live so his children could attend school in the \nU.S. for the 2021 \u2013 2022 school year. During the summers of 2021 and 2022, they \nreturned to Kosovo. He appeared for his hearing virtually from Kosovo. While he wants \nhis children to experience their heritage in Kosovo, he does not want them to attend the \npublic schools there. However, he cannot afford private Kosovo schools without the \nincome from his potential employment as a linguist there. Pending the outcome of this \nadjudication, he planned to return with his family to the United States so his children can \nattend school here. It is assumed that he has returned to the United States for the 2022 \n\u2013 2023 school year. Applicant will bring his family back to Kosovo if he gets his clearance, \nand he eventually wants to retire there. (GX 1; Tr. 4, 25 \u2013 27, 39, 50 \u2013 52) \nApplicant also owns three properties in Kosovo, which he purchased between \n2014 and 2018. During his background investigation and counterintelligence screening \nfor his linguist position, he estimated those properties were worth about $180,000 total. \nAt his hearing, he testified their value has likely increased significantly. When he is in \nKosovo, Applicant and his family live in an apartment he owns. He leases the other two \nproperties to a friend who uses one as a bar and restaurant business, and the other as \nstorage for that business. (GX 1 \u2013 GX 3; Tr. 44 \u2013 47) \nApplicant does most of his banking through U.S.-based financial institutions. \nDuring his previous employment as a linguist, he opened a bank account in Kosovo for \nhis wife to use while he resided at the U.S. military facility. At one point, he had deposited \nabout $12,000 USD in that account, but he now estimates there is about $3,500 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nremaining. In his other U.S. accounts, Applicant has about $50,000 in retirement savings \nand investment funds. He has been able to support his family through non-defense \nindustry jobs while in the United States, proceeds from the two properties he leases in \nKosovo, and a monthly disability benefit from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \nWhen they are in Kosovo, his wife works as a teacher. When they were last in the United \nStates, he worked as a delivery driver between November 2021 and May 2022. (GX 1 \u2013 \n3; Tr. 54 \u2013 58) \nApplicant\u2019s parents are both retired teachers. When he and his family are in \nKosovo, he visits or calls them almost every day. When he is in the United States, he \ncalls them several times weekly. The same is true for his contact with his brothers and \nsisters, a sister-in-law, and a niece who are resident citizens of Kosovo. Applicant also \nhas continuing contact with his best friend and his wife, and with two childhood friends \nwhen he is in Kosovo, but their interactions are less frequent when he and his wife and \nchildren are in the United States. None of Applicant\u2019s family members or his friends are \nemployed by the Kosovo government; nor do they have any other connection to the \ngovernment of Kosovo or any other foreign country. (GX 2; Tr. 40 \u2013 43) \nTo properly assess the security significance of foregoing within the adjudicative \nguideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Kosovo as \npresented in GX 4. Additionally, some of the information about Kosovo requires \nexamination of the breakup of Yugoslavia and the ensuing Balkans War and Kosovo \nConflict. To that end, I sua sponte have taken notice of information about that region and \ncurrent U.S. involvement there that is available on the U.S. Department of State website \n(https://www.state.gov) and the CIA Factbook (https://www.cia.gov). \nSince separating from Serbia and Yugoslavia, Kosovo has generally modeled its \nsystem of governance on western democracies. Since the end of the Kosovo War in 1999, \nthe United States has been actively involved in helping Kosovo establish an independent \njudiciary and to provide for its own security. The U.S. and NATO have maintained a \nmilitary presence in Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) made up of troops from \n28 countries. KFOR is still required in Kosovo to help counter instability caused by the \ninflux from foreign fighters, such as ISIS, and large numbers of migrants displaced by the \ncivil war in Syria and ongoing violence in Iraq and Kurdistan. Additionally, the U.S. \nDepartment of State has issued travel advisories for travel in certain parts of Kosovo \nwhere ethnic tensions and civil unrest continue to flare up and act as catalysts for terrorist \nactivities. \nKosovo\u2019s political system is premised on open representation of its citizens and \nthe emphasis on individual liberties and the rule of law. Nonetheless, human rights \nviolations are not uncommon, mostly affecting under-represented ethnic minorities. The \nState Department\u2019s 2021 Human Rights Executive Summary stated the following: \nSignificant human rights issues included credible reports of: serious \nrestrictions on free expression and media, including violence or threats of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nviolence against journalists; serious government corruption and impunity; \nand crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting ethnic \nminorities or other marginalized communities. The government took steps \nto identify, investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed \nhuman rights abuses, but at times lacked consistency. Many in the \ngovernment, the opposition, civil society, and the media reported instances \nof senior officials engaging in corruption or acting with impunity. The \ngovernment sometimes suspended, removed offenders from office, or \ntransferred the accused, and the justice sector sometimes took steps to \nprosecute and punish those officials who committed abuses, offenses, and \ncrimes. Many corrupt officials, however, continued to occupy public sector \npositions. \nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that Kosovo strives to be a stable, \ndemocratically-governed country, with interests consistent with those of the European \nUnion and NATO. Nonetheless, there is a continuing need for a U.S.-led security \npresence. Persistent ethnic strife, terrorist activities, an uneven human rights record, and \nother conditions on which the State Department has based its travel advisories for \nKosovo, all support a finding that there is a heightened risk associated with having \npersonal and financial ties there. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; see also AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence  \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe Government\u2019s information, as well as Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR and \nhis statements during his PSI and during counterintelligence screening for his most recent \nemployment all support the SOR allegations. Additionally, based on the Government\u2019s \ninformation in support of its request for administrative notice of facts about Kosovo, \nconditions in that country present a heightened risk that Applicant\u2019s relatives and \nassociates in Kosovo may be vulnerable to pressure or coercion as a means of \ncompromising Applicant\u2019s willingness and ability to protect sensitive U.S. information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following AG \u00b6 7 disqualifying conditions apply: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) applies based on his close and continuing contacts with his wife, parents \nand other family members, as well as long-time friends, all of whom are citizen residents \nof Kosovo. AG \u00b6 7(f) applies based on his continued ownership of three properties in \nKosovo, the value of which, when compared to his stated income and savings, constitutes \nthe majority of his net worth. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nThe record does not support application of any of these mitigating conditions. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply because Applicant has frequent contact with his family and \nfriends in Kosovo, a country that poses \u201ca heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d His relationships with those citizen \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresidents of Kosovo is presumed to be close and he did not present any information that \nwould rebut that presumption. Further, AG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply because Applicant does \nnot benefit from any deep ties to, or relationships in, the United States that might \ncounterbalance his interests in Kosovo. Since leaving the U.S. Army in 2007, Applicant \nhas lived continuously in Kosovo for most of the next 13 years, returning to the United \nStates in August 2020 only because he was unsure of his ability to gain employment with \na defense contractor that would allow him to remain in Kosovo. One effect of his choice \nto stay in Kosovo, even after his contractor employment ended in 2015, was that he his \npresence in the United States was not legally sufficient to allow his children to derive U.S. \ncitizenship from him. He and his immediate family live in Kosovo at least three months \nout of each year, returning to rented housing in the United States only for the school year. \nIf he could afford better schools in Kosovo through defense contractor employment, he \nwould prefer to live in his native country. He also intends to retire there. \nI also am mindful of Applicant\u2019s military service. It is highly significant that he \nwillingly risked his life in service to the United States and its interests in the Middle East. \nOn this point, he is owed a measure of gratitude. Yet, his five years of service constitutes \nhis only real presence in the United States. As soon as he was discharged, he returned \nto Kosovo, started a family, and bought three properties between 2014 and 2018. Aside \nfrom the 2020 \u2013 2021 and (presumably) the 2022 \u2013 2023 school years in the United \nStates, he has chosen to remain in Kosovo since 2007, regardless of his employment \nstatus. All of the foregoing sustains doubts about whether Applicant has any \u201cdeep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States\u201d that might cause him \u201cto \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s property and financial interests in \nKosovo are significant. He estimates his property values have increased since the SOR \nwas issued. In addition to his monthly VA disability benefits, the rental income he receives \nhelps support his wife and children. As noted above, all of the available information \nprobative of his finances shows that his holdings in Kosovo make up the majority of his \nnet worth. On balance, the security concerns about foreign influence are not mitigated. \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). In the context of assessing an individual\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation, his circumstances must be examined with the protection of the national \ninterest in mind. Those circumstances have changed significantly since Applicant first \nreceived a security clearance in connection with his military service. The government is \nnot estopped from re-assessing an individual\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation, particularly in response to new facts and circumstances. This decision is a \nrecognition of the heightened risks associated with Applicant\u2019s close ties of affection for \npersons in a country that still presents a heightened risk of manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion aimed at leveraging an individual\u2019s access to classified information. When \ncompared to Applicant\u2019s relatively minor presence in, or ties to, the United States, his \npersonal ties and interests in Kosovo sustain doubts about the suitability of granting him \naccess to classified information. Because protection of the interests of national security \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nis the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant\u2019s request for clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to \nhave access to classified information.

(Tr. at 37-40, 42-43, \n48-60) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant provided \ndocumentation reflecting that he resolved SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h., and \n1.i; he was paying SOR debt \u00b6 1.f; and he was disputing SOR debt \u00b6 1.b. He intends to \ncontinue to pay his monthly child support obligation. He established good-faith efforts to \nrepay his debts, his finances are under control, and his remaining financial issues are \nbeing addressed responsibly and no longer cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, \nand reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - i:   \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

The record was held \nopen until February 15, 2022, to permit Applicant an opportunity to provide any \ndocuments he wanted considered. He did not provide any and the record closed. Hearing \nExhibits I and II are confirmation emails that Applicant was sent and received the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits. DOHA received the hearing transcript on February 4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.i, and 2.a. He denied the SOR \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 59 years old. He earned some college credits, but not a degree. He \nwas married from 1987 to 2004 and from 2007 to 2009. Both marriages ended in divorce. \nHe has two grown children. He has been working for his present employer since \nDecember 2018 and has been steadily employed since February 2017. He stated that he \nwould like to serve his government. (Transcript (Tr.) 19-22, 52; GE 1) \nApplicant and his father were in business together. Originally Applicant owned \nthree shops and his father owned ten shops. They merged their businesses. At some \npoint, Applicant was the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. It is unknown \nif or when his father no longer participated in the business. Applicant had about 300 \nemployees. He was aware he was required to withhold federal payroll taxes and FICA \npayments associated with the business and turn it over to the IRS. He had complied with \nthis requirement in the past. At some point, he experienced financial difficulties, and did \nnot turn over the payments he withheld from his employees to the IRS as required. He \ntestified that he was trying to keep his employees paid. (Tr. 24-37; GE 6) \nApplicant was charged criminally and in about January 2010, he pled guilty and \nwas found guilty for failure to pay over withholding and FICA taxes for tax year 2004. Five \nother charges were dismissed as part of his plea agreement. He was sentenced to \nimprisonment for 12 months and one day and required to make restitution in the \napproximate amount of $148,702. Applicant testified that he served six months in federal \nprison and the remaining six months and a day in a halfway house. The plea agreement \nrequired that he pay $100 a month, based on his income. (Tr. 24-37; GE 6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2019 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed his \nperiods of unemployment from September 2015 to February 2017. Applicant testified that \nhe made the monthly restitution payments until he got sick, and he was unemployed and \non disability. He said 15% of his disability payment was garnished to pay the restitution \nduring this time. Applicant resumed working in February 2017. He testified that he has \nnot resumed paying the required restitution. He said he contacted the Government about \nresuming his payments, but was told his wages would be garnished. They were not.

He testified that he is now in negotiations \nfor resolving his restitution issues. He said he has been saving his money in anticipation \nof resuming his restitution payments and has put about $11,000 in his 401(k) pension \nplan. He does not know how to withdraw money from this account, but he is making \ninquiries for help in doing so. He stated that he has paid approximately $15,000 in \nrestitution. No supporting documents were provided. (Tr. 24-40, 50-51; GE 1, 6) \nApplicant testified that he did not initiate contact with the Government because he \nwas scared. He stated that he has filed his past income tax returns, and he owes federal \nincome taxes for tax years 2004, 2012, and other tax years that he could not recall. He \nestimated he owes approximately $10,000 in delinquent federal income taxes. Applicant \ntestified that he also owes approximately $7,000 to $8,000 for state income taxes and \nalso business taxes for his now defunct business. He does not know the amount and has \nno payment plan at this time to resolve these taxes. (Tr. 38-40, 44-45) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR, will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions, when making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nThe SOR alleged a charged-off credit card debt (\u00b6 1.a -$18,349) and medical debts \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h-totalling approximately $2,128). Applicant admitted the credit card \ndebt, which he said became delinquent in December 2015, when he was sick and could \nnot pay it. He testified he contacted the creditor in either 2016 or 2017 and told them he \ncould not pay the debt. He believed the debt was written-off as a bad debt by the creditor. \nNo other information was provided. The debt is not resolved. (Tr. 40-44) \nApplicant denied all of the medical debts in the SOR. He stated that he was on \ndisability when the debts were incurred, and they should have been paid by Medicaid. He \nstated he contacted the creditors and disputed them over the telephone and also disputed \nthem with the credit bureaus. He indicated he would attempt to find the documents \nregarding his disputes. No information was provided regarding the resolution of his \ndisputes or other documents to support he is not responsible for these debts. All of the \nalleged SOR debts are supported by credit reports from January 2022, March 2021, \nSeptember 2019, and January 2019. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 40-44; GE 2, 3, 4, \n5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust.  \nApplicant has a delinquent credit-card debt and numerous medical debts that are \nunresolved. As an employer, he withheld federal taxes and FICA payments from his \nemployees and failed to turn the funds over to the IRS as required. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant has a felony conviction for failing to pay the Government the amounts he \nwithheld from his employees for federal taxes and FICA payments. Pursuant to his plea \nagreement, he is required to pay $100 a month in restitution. He said he paid the \nrestitution for a period and then was unemployed and it was garnished from his disability \npayments. He did not provide documents to show his past payments. He said he was told \nsometime in 2017 that his pay would be garnished and applied to the restitution. He also \nsaid he has not had contact with the Government regarding the payments since 2017, \nuntil recently when his account was frozen. Applicant did not provide any evidence of his \nefforts to resolve his other delinquent debts or provide evidence of his disputes and the \nresolution of those disputes. His delinquent debts cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. Although, he said he stopped paying his court-\nordered restitution because he became ill and it was being withheld from his disability \npayments, he did not provide evidence to substantiate his statements. His financial \nproblems were caused by his criminal conduct. His inability to make restitution payments \nafter he became ill was beyond his control, but he has not made a reasonable effort to \nresume the payments or to address his other delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication. There is no evidence of financial counseling or a good-faith effort to resolve \nhis delinquent debts. None of the other mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn 2010, Applicant pled guilty to and was found guilty of a felony for failure to pay \nover withholding and FICA taxes for tax year 2004. Five other charges were dismissed \nas part of the plea agreement. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months and a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nday and required to make restitution in the approximate amount of $148,702. The above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant was required to pay restitution of $148,702 as part of his plea agreement. \nHe was to make $100 payments. He testified that he made payments, but stopped \nsometime in 2015 when he became sick and was unable to work. He said the Government \ngarnished 15% of his disability payments to be applied to his restitution. When he \nresumed working in 2017, he said he was told his wages would be garnished. They were \nnot, and he has not had any contact with the Government about resuming his restitution \npayments, until his account was recently frozen. He provided no evidence to substantiate \nhis testimony that he has paid about $15,000 in restitution. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred in 2004 and he was sentenced in \n2010, he has failed to comply with the terms of his plea agreement and the court-ordered \nrestitution. There is insufficient evidence of rehabilitation. His felony conviction is serious \nand calls into question his willingness to comply with laws. His conduct casts doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those Guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a felony conviction for failing to turn over withholding and FICA \npayments to the Government. He is required to pay restitution, but has failed to make \npayments since at least 2017 and has a substantial debt to the Federal Government. He \nhas not paid income taxes owed for other tax years and state taxes that were not alleged. \nHe owes other debts that he has not resolved. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct and failure to make payments pursuant to the court-\nordered restitution as part of his plea agreement raise serious concerns. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline J, \ncriminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n1 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd.

Because he had \nto travel to appear at the hearing, Applicant also explained the reason for his trip to his \nyoung children who were concerned about his impending absence and accompanying \nstress level. He explained to them that he made a mistake and that he had to address it. \n(Tr. 21-22, 27-29; GE 3; Answer) \nOn his own, Applicant procured an evaluation from a certified substance abuse \ncounselor. The counselor opined that Applicant did not meet the requirement under the \nDSM-5 criteria for substance use disorder and did not recommend any course of \ntreatment. Applicant also submitted to two urinalysis tests in January 2019, which were \nnegative for illegal substances. (Tr. 33-34; Answer) \nApplicant has not used marijuana since March 2018. He submitted a signed \nstatement of intent to refrain from drug use in the future. His wife witnessed the \nstatement, indicating that she will support Applicant in his decision to abstain from future \nuse of illegal drugs. (Tr. 32-33) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse guideline. The government has established a prima facie case. \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . that cause physical or mental \nimpairment . . . raises questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. (See AG \u00b6 24). \nApplicant, a KMP, self-reported using marijuana/THC products on four occasions \nbetween 2015 and 2018, while having a security clearance. His conduct requires the \napplication of the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and,  \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant submitted sufficient evidence to mitigate the alleged concerns. He took \nresponsibility for his misconduct. His marijuana use was infrequent, recreational, and \nnot indicative of a substance abuse problem. His last use occurred four years ago. \nAlthough his decision to use marijuana was a poor one, that decision does not reflect on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or reliability. His promise to abstain from illegal \ndrug use in the future is credible. He executed a signed statement of intent to abstain, \nan intention that is supported by his wife. The following mitigating conditions apply: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast do not on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and, \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem and has established a pattern of abstinence, including: \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility.  \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s ongoing security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant acknowledges his poor judgment in deciding to use illegal \ndrugs while holding a security clearance. It is not the purpose of a security clearance \ncase to punish or sanction a person for their past actions. Rather, it is a predictive risk \nassessment based on the past conduct. He is aware of the prohibition against such use \nas a clearance holder. By voluntarily disclosing his marijuana use, Applicant has shown \nthat he is likely to self-report adverse information even when doing so may be against \nhis personal, professional, and financial interests.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

The case was assigned to another administrative \njudge on November 30, 2021, and reassigned to me on December 14, 2021. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 15, \n2021, scheduling the hearing for January 11, 2022.

The financial \nconsiderations allegations are established by his admissions in security clearance \napplications from February 2017 (SCA 1) and May 2018 (SCA 2), in his February 2021 \nresponse to interrogatories, and during background interviews from November 2018 and \nDecember 2018, as well as by bankruptcy court records and three credit reports from \n2018, 2019, and 2020. (Answer; GE 1-8) \nPersonal Conduct \nAGA 1 records reflect that in approximately February 2010, while employed as an \nacting unit chief, Applicant \u201cdropped several dollar bills down the shirt of [F1] while she \nwas at her desk.\u201d As a result of Applicant\u2019s unprofessional on-duty conduct, AGA 1 \nsuspended Applicant for 20 days without pay, and ordered him to obtain counseling from \nHuman Resources on proper office behavior. This was Applicant\u2019s first disciplinary \nincident at AGA 1, and his AGA 1 security clearance was not suspended or revoked as a \nresult. (Tr. at 23-31, 103-117; GE 4) \nApplicant denied any malicious intent. He testified that he had been working late \nover a period of several months, and on one such night at approximately 9:00 pm, he \nencountered F1 sitting at her desk with a cake on the table in front of her. F1 was a \nsecretary, with whom he had solely a professional relationship, and he spoke with her on \nan almost daily basis for the preceding five to six months. He described F1 as \u201cyounger \nthan my youngest grandchild at the time.\u201d When he learned from F1 that it was her \nbirthday cake, he engaged in a southern tradition, familiar to him, called \u201cpinning.\u201d He \nexplained that when a person has a birthday, \u201cwe take a pin and we pin dollar bills on \ntheir collar. And everybody would do that. So you dress them in dollar bills as good luck.\u201d \n(Answer; Tr. at 23-31, 103-117) \nApplicant stated: \nSo I didn\u2019t have a pin and I reached over -- I said if you don\u2019t mind, I don\u2019t \nhave a pin, but here. It was about five or six singles. I said tomorrow morning \nbuy yourself lunch on me because lunch is only about $3 or $4.

And I told her to buy herself \nlunch the next day. And I walked out. \n(Tr. at 26) \nApplicant testified that he subsequently saw F1 for three weeks \u201cand we spoke as \nwe normally did,\u201d until he was called into an office and told that he was being investigated \nfor the above-described incident. He testified that he subsequently talked to F1, and F1 \ntold him \u201cyes, when you did it, I was offended.\u201d He testified that he apologized to F1, told \nher he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean anything by it\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to offend [her],\u201d and she responded \nby telling him that he was forgiven. He testified that he learned, years later, that F1 had \nbeen dating the \u201ccurrent Deputy Director\u201d of AGA 1. Applicant testified that this individual \ndid not like Applicant and was not satisfied unless Applicant was punished for this \nincident, despite F1\u2019s acceptance of Applicant\u2019s apology. (Answer; Tr. at 23-31, 103-117) \nAGA 1\u2019s suspension was upheld on appeal. Applicant testified that he hired an \nattorney and filed a lawsuit against AGA 1, alleging that AGA 1 punished him harsher for \nthis incident than other AGA 1 employees who had committed more egregious acts. \nApplicant testified that AGA 1 settled this lawsuit in approximately 2012 and paid him \n$50,000, of which $41,000 went to his attorney\u2019s fees. He did not provide documentation \nto corroborate his claims. He acknowledged that F1 never gave him any indication that it \nwas permissible for him to touch her, and he should have known better. He testified that \nhe pinned her \u201coff the cuff,\u201d and realized that it was unwise for him to have done so. He \nintended to never engage in this behavior again. (Answer; Tr. at 23-31, 103-117) \nAGA 1 records also reflect that in approximately January 2016, while employed by \nAGA 1 and assigned overseas, Applicant allowed F2 to drive an AGA 1-issued vehicle, \nbehaved in an inappropriate and offensive manner towards F2 in the form of an \nunwelcomed sexual advance, and lacked candor when questioned about the incident and \nin his signed sworn statement during a disciplinary inquiry. Consequently, AGA 1 \nproposed Applicant for dismissal in August 2016; Applicant voluntarily retired in \nSeptember 2016; and the disciplinary inquiry closed based on Applicant\u2019s retirement. This \nwas Applicant\u2019s second disciplinary incident at AGA 1, and his AGA 1 security clearance \nwas again not suspended or revoked as a result. (Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 4) \nApplicant admitted only to allowing F2 to drive a vehicle, but he denied knowing \nthat it was an AGA 1-issued vehicle. He also denied that he behaved in an inappropriate \nand offensive manner towards F2 in the form of an unwelcomed sexual advance, and that \nhe lacked candor when questioned about the incident and in his signed sworn statement \nduring a disciplinary inquiry. He testified that AGA 1 placed him on an overseas \nassignment in 2015, after the individual in charge (BOSS) personally asked him for his \nassistance due to being understaffed. During the incident in question, in October 2015, \nBOSS was out of the country. (Answer; Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3) \nOn that morning, Applicant testified that his supervisor (SUP), who was the acting \nBOSS, asked him to drive her daughter, F2, home after an AGA 1 function that evening, \nbecause SUP would be with her spouse celebrating their anniversary.

He testified \nthat F2 was around 24 or 25 years old at the time, was an AGA 2 employee, and he had \nbriefly met F2 one week prior when SUP had him over for dinner. At the conclusion of the \nAGA 1 function, at approximately 9:00 pm, he acquiesced to F2\u2019s request to grab a quick \nbite to eat. He testified that F2 was not ready to go home and he had also not eaten since \nmid-day, but he insisted to F2 that he would have to drive her home as soon as they \nfinished eating. (Answer; Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3) \nApplicant permitted F2 to drive the car to a restaurant she liked. He testified that \nhe did so because he had mistakenly left his glasses on his desk and could not drive \nwithout them at night; F2 was more familiar with the area than he was, with the exception \nof the route he knew for how to drive her directly back home from the venue where the \nfunction was held that evening; he had not seen F2 consume any alcohol that evening, \nand F2 told him she had not consumed any alcohol when he asked her if she had; and \nhe thought it was permissible since he believed the car was AGA 2-issued and F2 was \nan AGA 2 employee. He testified that the car\u2019s license plate said \u201c[AGA 2]\u201d and \u201c[BOSS]\u201d \nin small print underneath it, and that he had never been briefed on the policy of the car. \n(Answer; Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that F2 consumed two beers at the first restaurant, and told him \nbefore their food arrived that she was ready to leave because she did not like the \nrestaurant\u2019s menu. He stated that he has never consumed alcohol.

He maintained \nthat he never made any sexual advances toward F2. He stated: \nI never made one inappropriate move or made any inappropriate comments \nto [F2]. What happened was, [F2] got drunk and she acted in a pattern -- in \na way inconsistent with her professionalism and she was embarrassed. And \nwe work in a small office. She was embarrassed to see me. She was \nembarrassed to talk to me after that. She lied and reversed everything and \nput it on me in that I was drinking and that I made inappropriate comments \nto her. And that I made -- I attempted to touch her inappropriately. Those \nwere all lies.  \n(Tr. at 29-66, 117-133) \nApplicant described F2 as manipulative.

He testified that F2 also had control over BOSS, through \nSUP. He testified that the following Thursday, SUP called him into her office and told him \nhe had to return stateside, which he did the following night--in November 2015.

There was nobody there to corroborate our statements. \nAnd they said I lied.\u201d He maintained that he told AGA 1 the truth during the disciplinary \ninquiry and he told AGA 1 that he would voluntarily submit to a polygraph to prove himself. \nHe acknowledged that he faced a dilemma: whether he should fight F2\u2019s claims through \nthe disciplinary inquiry and risk dismissal from AGA 1, just as he was reaching his \nmandatory retirement age in April 2017. He stated that he knew the internal AGA 1 \ninvestigation would be a lengthy process; he was not liked by upper management at AGA \n1, to include the individual who sought to punish him during the 2010 incident; he was \nhaving medical issues, as further discussed below; and his divorce had become \ncontentious. He chose not to jeopardize his retirement and he elected to retire in May \n2016. He continued to work until the end of September 2016, while holding his AGA 1 \nsecurity clearance and in a classified facility. His security clearance lapsed after he was \nno longer employed by AGA 1. (Answer; Tr. at 29-67, 80-84, 117-133; GE 1, 2, 3, 4) \nAGA 1 records reflect that in both the 2010 and 2015 incidents, Applicant refused \nto take any responsibility for his predatory actions; he continually blamed the victims; and \nhe also potentially harmed AGA 1\u2019s reputation because the victims trusted him based on \nhis position within AGA 1. There is no evidence that Applicant had any other incidents of \nunprofessional conduct during his employment with AGA 1 or with any other employer. \nHe testified that he was raised to live his life according to Christian principles, as his father \nwas a deacon, his mother was a deaconess, and he also served as a deacon in his \nchurch. Although his philosophy was to try to always do good, he learned as a result of \nthese incidents to keep a strictly professional interaction with females and to take caution \nto not allow himself to be in an environment with another female without a witness. (Tr. at \n23, 147-148; GE 4) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant previously petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in approximately 1997. \nHe stated that after his ex-spouse got into a car accident, she signed an agreement with \ntheir insurance company, unbeknownst to him, that allowed the insurance company to \nrecoup her related medical expenses of approximately $27,000 from any settlement she \nreceived. When she did not follow through with the agreement, he faced a potential \ngarnishment of his wages at AGA 1, as his ex-spouse never worked outside of the home. \nHe stated that the garnishment order would have jeopardized his employment with AGA \n1, so he elected to file bankruptcy. I will not consider Applicant\u2019s 1997 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, or any other matter not alleged in the SOR, in evaluating the disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline; however, I will consider this information in my mitigation \nand whole-person analysis.

He also received credit counseling through his bankruptcy case. (Answer; \nTr. at 75-76, 79, 151-152; GE 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) \nApplicant attributed his 2020 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and associated financial \ndelinquencies to beginning in 2015, when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and \nbegan incurring medical debt. After he retired from AGA 1, he was also unemployed from \nOctober 2016 to January 2017. Following his prostatectomy in 2017, he suffered from \nlife-threatening medical problems and incurred more significant medical debt. He was \nunemployed again from March 2018 until September 2019. In 2018, when his then-\nspouse filed for divorce, he was initially ordered to pay her alimony of $2,000 monthly and \nthen $1,500 monthly. He incurred alimony arrears totaling approximately $52,000. He \nalso financially assisted his daughter, after her spouse left her and she became a \nstruggling single mother. He stated in SCA 1 that he was working with a credit repair \ncompany to dispute inaccuracies on his credit reports.

He also testified that the \nbalance of his alimony arrears, after OPM\u2019s issuance of a check to his ex-spouse, was \napproximately $13,000. As of the date of the hearing, he testified that he also continued \nto pay his ex-spouse court-ordered alimony of half of his AGA 1 retirement pay, or $2,000 \nmonthly, and he intended to continue to abide by the court\u2019s alimony order. (Tr. at 69-72, \n78, 140-144; AE M, N) \nDocumentation reflects that as of May 2021, the balance of his alimony arrears \nwas $15,845.

He also receives \napproximately $400 monthly from his AGA 1 retirement pay, as he testified that $2,000 is \nallotted for his alimony payments to his ex-spouse and approximately $1,600 is allotted \nto OPM, as previously discussed. He testified that he has an accountant assist him with \nfiling his income tax returns. He endeavored to become a more contributing member of \nhis household, and he desired to return to his passion of serving his country in the national \nsecurity field.

She felt that the personal conduct security concerns were \n\u201cvery hard to believe,\u201d as she and Applicant are devout Christians with strong moral \nvalues, and although Applicant is a friendly person \u201cwho does not know any strangers,\u201d \nhe is a professional with an unwavering devotion to country. She supported Applicant\u2019s \ndecision to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, as he incurred significant medical debt due to \ncancer and related life-threatening complications, and he went through a divorce. She \nwas aware that Applicant owed alimony arrears and outstanding taxes, and stated that \nthese obligations were Applicant\u2019s responsibility since he incurred them before their \nrelationship commenced. She stated that she gave Applicant her tax attorney\u2019s \ninformation, so that Applicant could work on resolving his outstanding taxes. If necessary, \nshe would loan him money to meet these obligations, with the understanding that he \nwould have to repay her. (Tr. at 177-198; AE O, P) \nApplicant\u2019s wife was the breadwinner during Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment. \nShe has worked for various DOD contractors since 2010, and she held a security \nclearance as of the date of the hearing. In March 2022, her employer awarded her a salary \nincrease as a result of her valued performance, and she earned $104,920 annually. She \nhandled the household finances, and stated that they lived frugally and on a budget. She \nstated that they had approximately $2,500 in savings as of the date of the hearing, and \nplanned to purchase a home together in the future. (Tr. at 177-198; AE O, P) \nOne of the character witnesses (W1) that testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf served in \nthe U.S. Army Special Forces for almost 30 years. W1 also worked for AGA 1 for 26 \nyears, to include as Applicant\u2019s supervisor from 2002 to 2004, and retired from AGA 1 in \nDecember 2005. W1 also knew Applicant personally.

Regarding the 2010 incident, W1 testified that Applicant may have \nexercised poor judgment in touching F1 without permission, but believed Applicant\u2019s \nintent was simply to recognize F1\u2019s birthday. W1 testified that he believed Applicant\u2019s \npunishment was harsher than appropriate, given the romantic connection between F1 \nand the senior AGA 1 executive. (Tr. at 154-171) \nThe remaining character witness (W2) that testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf was W1\u2019s \nspouse and a retired U.S. Army Colonel.

W2 testified that Applicant \u201chas come to our house for meals and other activities.\u201d \nW2 described Applicant as an honorable, devoted, professional, caring, and modest \nindividual. A number of character references with long-standing professional and personal \nrelationships with Applicant, to include a former AGA 1 supervisor as well as former AGA \n1 colleagues, also attested to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, integrity, loyalty, and \nunquestionable character. (Tr. at 171-177; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n11 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information . . . ; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . . ; and \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: . . . (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the\nperson's personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile employed by AGA 1, Applicant engaged in unprofessional conduct on duty \nwith F1 in 2010. In 2015, while employed by AGA 1 and assigned overseas, Applicant \nallowed F2 to drive an AGA 1-issued vehicle, behaved in an inappropriate and offensive \nmanner towards F2 in the form of an unwelcomed sexual advance, and lacked candor \nwhen questioned about the incident and in his signed sworn statement during a \ndisciplinary inquiry. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), 16(d)(1), 16(d)(2), and 16(e) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes the following conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant acknowledged that F1 never gave him any indication in 2010 that it was \npermissible for him to tuck several dollars in her sweater, regardless of his intent that he \ndid so in the tradition of \u201cpinning\u201d in celebration of her birthday. He understood that he \nshould have known better and realized that he acted unwisely. He intended to never \nengage in this behavior again. \nHowever, in 2015, Applicant allowed F2 to drive an AGA 1-issued vehicle, behaved \nin an inappropriate and offensive manner towards F2 in the form of an unwelcomed sexual \nadvance, and lacked candor when questioned about the incident and in his signed sworn \nstatement during a disciplinary inquiry. Although disputed by Applicant, AGA 1 \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nsubstantiated Applicant\u2019s conduct and consequently proposed him for dismissal. \nApplicant\u2019s opportunity to continue to dispute F2\u2019s allegations was through AGA 1\u2019s \ndisciplinary inquiry, which ended when Applicant elected to and AGA 1 permitted him to \nretire. And yet, Applicant continues to place blame on F2 rather than take responsibility. \nHis testimony was not credible in light of the record evidence, and his conduct continues \nto raise doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(b), \n17(c), 17(d), 17(e), and 17(f) do not apply.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts, and he failed to pay his federal income tax \nof $1,000 for TY 2017. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\n \n \n \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control; \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly \nunder his circumstances. Applicant received credit counseling and resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d \nthrough 2.p through his 2021 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. His previous petition for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy was 23 years ago, and each of these bankruptcy cases occurred \nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur. In addition, Applicant has been working to \nresolve his alimony arrears since at least June 2021. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d through 2.p, and I find those allegations in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues, however, are current, ongoing, and recent. He did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate his claim that he paid his outstanding federal taxes \nof $1,000 for TY 2017. In addition, he owes a total of approximately $12,799 in federal \ntaxes for TY 2018, 2019, and 2020, and $5,194 in state taxes for TY 2019 and 2020. He \ndid not provide documentation to corroborate his claims of payment, and there is no \nevidence that the IRS or the state tax authority approved his requested monthly payment \nplans of $75 and $175, respectively, to resolve his delinquent federal and state taxes. I \nfind that Applicant\u2019s tax issues are not under control, and they continue to cast doubt on \nhis judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d) and 20(g) \nare not established as to SOR \u00b6 2.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and F in my \nwhole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.d \u2013 2.p:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact There are eight delinquent accounts alleged in the June 2021 SOR. The accounts are in collection or charged off. The debts became delinquent between November 2013 and February 2019. The total amount of debt is $33,546. The Government credit bureau reports and the PSIs confirm the validity of most of the listed delinquent debts. In her answer to the SOR allegations, she apparently agreed that the accounts were accurate. However, in her view, all accounts, whether satisfied or not, were removed by identity fraud, dispute, or by the statute of limitations. (GE 4, 5, 9; answer to SOR) Applicant is 34 years old. After three years of marriage, she received a divorce in February 2019. She has no children but is expecting. In October 2020, she began working for a defense contractor as a technical writer. Since her hire, she has taken on 3 additional tasks and is currently a subject matter expert. Her present salary is approximately $120,000. Before her current job, she was a records manager at a computer store. From March 2012 to March 2019, she was a records analyst-librarian. Her reported unemployment since October 2006 was for one month in early 2012.

She began having financial \nproblems in 2013. With the help of a debt repair firm, some of the delinquent accounts \nproblems were resolved, but most of the listed debt remained. Her evidence in \nmitigation is insufficient to overcome the continuing security concerns arising from the \nguideline for financial considerations. Eligibility for security clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 15, 2019, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On April 6, 2020, and March 16, 2014, she provided personal \nsubject interviews (PSIs) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). The Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) could not make the affirmative findings required to continue \na security clearance, and issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nJune 10, 2021, detailing security concerns raised by financial considerations (Guideline \nF).

The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 3, 2022, for a \nhearing on August 22, 2022. The hearing was held by TEAMS video teleconference as \nscheduled. Applicant objected to several of the nine exhibits the Government was \nseeking for admission into evidence. The reasons for her objections, the Government\u2019s \nresponse to those objections, and my rulings, are explained below in Rulings on \nProcedure. Ultimately, I entered the Government\u2019s nine exhibits (GE) 1-9 into evidence \nover Applicant\u2019s objections. I entered her four exhibits (AE) A-D into evidence without \nobjection. On September 9, 2022, I admitted Applicant\u2019s seven post-hearing exhibits \n(AE E-AE K) into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nAugust 30, 2022. The record closed on September 9, 2022. \nRulings on Procedure \nIn the early portion of the August 2022 hearing, Applicant objected to the \nintroduction of several Government exhibits into evidence. \nGE 1 (March 2019 e\u2013QIP) - Applicant objected to this exhibit because \u201csome of \nthe dates are not within the timeline that was proposed by e-QIP.\u201d (Tr. 13) Her \nadditional remarks were that when speaking \u201cwith e-QIP, they asked [Applicant] to \nminimize the information that was on there because there was too much. There was too \nmuch information. It surpassed the years they were looking for.\u201d (Tr. 14) Applicant \nindicated, \u201cthey actually said it was too much information. The years extended the \ntimeline they were looking for.\u201d (Tr. 15) Applicant did not explain what \u201ce-QIP\u201d or \u201cthey\u201d \nsignified within the context of the above quotes. She admitted that her e-QIP was \naccurate. I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection, and admitted to the exhibit because it was \nmaterial, relevant, and her signature appears in the signature section attachment to the \ne-QIP. (GE 1, Signature Forms at 1; Tr. 13-16) \nGE 2 (April 2019 PSI) \u2013 Applicant objected to the interview because she was \nnot represented by an attorney or she had not rehired the debt firm when the interview \nwas conducted. In security clearance investigations, an applicant has no right to an \nattorney because the process is not criminal in nature. After receiving explanations \nabout certain words within the exhibit, Applicant withdrew her objection, though she \nindicated she was unaware of the delinquent accounts at the time of the April 2019 \ninterview. I admitted the exhibit into evidence. (GE 2 at 2; Tr. 19-23) \nGE 3 (March 2014 PSI) \u2013 Applicant objected to this exhibit because \u201cThey have \nall reached their statutes of limitations and/or were closed by meeting the minimum \n2 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nbalance due.\u201d (Tr. 24) I misinterpreted the above statement as an objection. Applicant \nhad no objection to the exhibit, and I admitted it into the record. (Tr. 23-27) \nGE 4 (October 2020 credit report) \u2013 Applicant objected to this exhibit as some \nof the accounts did not belong to her and she filed two written complaints dated May \n2019, in which she disputed them directly or indirectly based on identity fraud. She \nclaimed those accounts were removed for those reasons. The reasons for Applicant\u2019s \nobjection relate to the weight I should assign the exhibit, but they do not preclude its \nadmissibility. (GE 8 at 3, 7, 9; Tr. 27-30) I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and admitted \nthe exhibit. She presented insufficient evidence to establish a substantive connection \nbetween her identity theft complaint and the debts listed in the SOR. \nGE 5 (March 2019 credit report) I admitted this exhibit into evidence without \nobjection. \nGE 6 (Eviction Filing record March 2018) \u2013 Applicant objected to this exhibit \nbecause she was not living at the residence at the time. She did not sign a second \nlease. The Government responded to Applicant\u2019s objection by noting that the \ninformation in the exhibit matches the information she provided in her e-QIP. Applicant \ncontended that her signature could have been forged. She asserted that she had \nchange of address information that confirmed that her residence was no longer at the \naddress posted in the exhibit. The Government indicated the exhibit was a business \nrecord, and she appears as the co-debtor. I overruled the objection and explained the \ntype of evidence Applicant should consider to bolster her position. (GE 1 at 9; Tr. 30-34) \nGE 7 (Eviction filing Record September 2012), GE 8 (Financial Documents \nProvided by Applicant to the April 2019 OPM investigator), GE 9 (August 2022 Credit \nReport) \u2013 Applicant had no objection to the entry into evidence of the three exhibits. \nRegarding GE 7 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), the March 2019 credit report shows that Applicant \ndisputed this account. However, she changed her position at the hearing and admitted \nresponsibility as the tenant of record. (GE 1 at 11-12; GE 5 at 5; GE 7; Tr. 34-36) \nFindings of Fact \nThere are eight delinquent accounts alleged in the June 2021 SOR. The \naccounts are in collection or charged off. The debts became delinquent between \nNovember 2013 and February 2019. The total amount of debt is $33,546. The \nGovernment credit bureau reports and the PSIs confirm the validity of most of the listed \ndelinquent debts. In her answer to the SOR allegations, she apparently agreed that the \naccounts were accurate. However, in her view, all accounts, whether satisfied or not, \nwere removed by identity fraud, dispute, or by the statute of limitations. (GE 4, 5, 9; \nanswer to SOR) \nApplicant is 34 years old. After three years of marriage, she received a divorce \nin February 2019. She has no children but is expecting. In October 2020, she began \nworking for a defense contractor as a technical writer.

Her present salary is \napproximately $120,000. Before her current job, she was a records manager at a \ncomputer store. From March 2012 to March 2019, she was a records analyst-librarian. \nHer reported unemployment since October 2006 was for one month in early 2012. \nDuring her professional career, she has also been a training administrative officer, an \nadministrative assistant, and a construction monitor. In March 2019, Applicant indicated \nthat she had never been investigated for a security clearance. However, a month later, \nshe stated she was granted a clearance by another agency in 2008. (GE 1 at 14-20, 23, \n32; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 47-48, 51, 78) \nOrigin of Financial Problems \nApplicant was 26 years old when she completed and certified her March 2014 \nPSI. Her total delinquent debts were over $30,000. She recalled that her contractor \nposition during the period exposed her to layoffs or unemployment on occasion. Earning \nonly a small amount of money, when the layoffs or unemployment occurred, she could \nnot cover her debts. She claimed she was a fraud-victim and became a part of a fraud \ncase conducted by two credit agency bureaus. When asked why she was not aware of \n$30,000 in delinquent debt, she replied, \u201cI guess ignorance,\u201d and also stated, \u201cthere\u2019s no \nexcuse.\u201d (Tr. 53-56) \nFollowing her 2014 PSI, Applicant hired a debt repair firm and initiated a \nmonthly payment plan with the firm to contact the creditors by letter and negotiate a \nprice for Applicant to pay. Regarding accounts that were not her responsibility, she \nindicated that the accounts were removed. She worked with the debt firm for at least a \nyear and a half and believed that she satisfied or settled most of the older debts by \n2016. However, she ran into financial trouble again for the same reasons as before \nbecause of layoffs, and a Government closure that put federal contractors out of work at \nan inconvenient time during a contract cycle. (Tr. 56-59) \nAt age 31, when Applicant filled out her e-QIP in March 2019, she did not \nmention any delinquent debts a second time. She did not consider that she had any \ndelinquent debts turned over to collection because: (1) the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were \ndisputed; (2) a payment plan was set up for SOR \u00b6 1.e; (3) SOR \u00b6 1.h was paid; (4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was under investigation; and, (5) SOR \u00b6 1.c was resolved when an attorney \ntold her that there was no eviction and she was not responsible for any outstanding \nbalance of the lease. Applicant did not disclose the SOR \u00b6 1.a account because she did \nnot believe she was responsible for a \u201ccharged-off\u201d debt. (Tr. 66) She also thought her \ndebt repair firm had resolved the account. (Tr. 66-72) There is no evidence that the firm \naddressed this account. \nAfter Applicant\u2019s April 2019 PSI, where she again denied that she had \ndelinquent debts, she rehired her debt firm for three to six months to resolve the \naccounts.

(Tr. 66-72, 73-74; AE G, H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Applicant opened an installment car loan in May 2014, with \nindividual liability. The last payment activity on the account was January 2016, when \nshe surrendered the car to the dealer because the interest rate was too high. She did \nnot consider returning the car under these circumstances to be a repossession. \nApplicant made an agreement with the dealer and the creditor that she would not be \nresponsible for the remaining balance. She indicated she would try to find \ndocumentation of the agreement. (Tr. 43) Subsequently, she conceded the agreement \nwas only verbal. Applicant claimed she was no longer responsible for the debt because \nher debt repair firm removed the account from her credit report. There is no \ndocumentation confirming that Applicant\u2019s debt repair firm disputed or closed the \naccount. (GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 3; Tr. 43, 59-61; 66-67; Answer to SOR; AE G, H) The \naccount has not been paid. \nSOR 1.b \u2013 This is a delinquent account for an apartment that Applicant rented \nin 2013. The proprietor filed a forcible entry and detainer action against Applicant and \nher then-husband in March 2018. The last payment activity on this account was in \nNovember 2013. Though Applicant indicated in her June 2021 answer that she opened \nthe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b accounts during her marriage (2016 to 2019), she agreed the \naccounts were actually opened during their five-year dating relationship before the \nmarriage. Applicant and her former husband lived together in several locations after \nthey met at an apartment complex in early 2013. (GE 5 at 5; GE 6; GE 7; Tr. 63-64) \nApplicant blamed the forcible entry and detainer action (SOR \u00b6 1.b) on the \nGovernment-wide closure and furlough in 2013. She claimed that her former husband at \nthe time forged her signature on checks to pay the rent, prompting her to dispute the \naccount because of several underhanded activities related to the check fraud. She \nalleged that her former husband shifted blame for the fraud to the proprietor\u2019s \nmaintenance workers. Applicant testified that she had a bank notarize one of the forged \nchecks. She indicated that she paid the balance due on the rental so that she could rent \nanother unit. She indicated she should be able to locate supporting documentation. (GE \n1 at 9, 22-23; GE 5 at 5; GE 6; Tr. 43-44, 51, 61-64; AE E) Applicant provided no \nadditional documentation regarding the fraudulent activities she accused her former \nhusband of committing. \nApplicant provided a copy of a lease (SOR \u00b6 1.b) beginning in March 2017 and \nending on March 31, 2018. She provided a copy of a payment receipt for a $700 check, \ndated March 21, 2018, claiming without supporting evidence, that this was the last \npayment under the lease that she decided not to renew. She contended that she never \nsigned another lease on the rental, and any signature could have been forged. She had \nchange-of-address information indicating that she was no longer at the SOR \u00b6 1.b \naddress at that time.

(GE 5 at 5) See AE I. \nNeither the change-of-address information nor evidence of her former \nhusband\u2019s fraudulent activity was produced. Applicant provided no reason why she did \nnot address the SOR \u00b6 1.b account when it originally became delinquent in November \n2013. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 This is a delinquent account for an apartment that Applicant rented \nin 2012. The proprietor filed a forcible entry and detainer action against Applicant and \nher then-husband in September 2012. She indicated in her answer that she agreed with \nthe account, but it was closed and removed by the statute of limitations. At the hearing, \nApplicant claimed that she had documentation revealing that her former husband was \ninvolved in a dispute with the leasing office. A lawyer wrote to Applicant that the action \nwas not an eviction, and advised her that she could not live at the same location with \nthe \u201cperson because that person was arguing with another tenant in the building.\u201d (Tr. \n44) The person Applicant was referring to was likely her former husband. She had \ndocumentation indicating that she was not responsible for any balances, and the lease \nhad to be terminated because of the ongoing squabble. Applicant claimed that she paid \nthe proprietor because she had to move into another apartment. (GE 5 at 5; GE 7; Tr. \n44-45) She provided no documentary evidence excusing her from responsibility for the \ndebt. As noted in Rulings on Procedure, though the credit March 2019 credit report \nshows that Applicant disputed this account, she changed her position at the hearing and \nadmitted responsibility as the tenant of record.

In her \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that she agreed that the account was satisfied, \nclosed and removed by the statute of limitations. At the hearing, she testified that she \ndisputed the account because it was not a debt that she produced. Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing documentation shows that she made a credit card payment of $161 on the debt \nin June 2019.

She opined that the delinquency occurred when she switched \ninsurance companies. On September 9, 2022, Applicant presented a payment receipt \ndated June 26, 2018. The receipt contains Applicant\u2019s maiden name and other \nidentifying characteristics. What is missing from the receipt is the name of the insurance \ncompany identified in the allegation. Instead, the central collection unit of a state agency \nappears at the top and in another location of the receipt. While this $150 payment was \nmade, I do not believe it represents a payment to the insurance company identified in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 46, 73; AE J) This account is not paid or settled. \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s present financial habits, she is much older. Her financial \nmanagement is a priority to her and her current credit report validates that concern. She \nlives within her means and is current on her financial obligations. She has incurred no \nnew debt. (Tr. 46-49) On January 25, 2016, she made a $170 payment to a utility \ncompany. The SOR does not allege this debt, although it was a collection account in \nMarch 2019. (GE 5 at 6) \nApplicant has received performance evaluations that both she and her \nemployer have generated. She did not include this character evidence in her post-\nhearing submissions. With her increased earnings, it is easier for her to save and \nmanage her finances. She subscribed to a credit bureau application that regularly \nmonitors her credit report while providing alerts and other financial management \nservices. Applicant testified that she had a budget, but she did not include a written \nbudget with her post-hearing exhibits. There is no evidence indicating that she has had \nfinancial counseling. In 2016, she started a small company that sells paintings and \nchildren\u2019s books. She has not received income from the company.

These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying her voluntarily incurred debts is a private matter \nuntil evidence reveals that she is not paying her debts in a timely fashion. Adverse \nevidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving \ndelinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd.

Oct. 26, 2006) The Government\u2019s credit reports \nestablish that the debts listed in the SOR became delinquent between November 2013 \nand February 2019. The total amount of debt posted in the SOR is $33,546. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) is not available for mitigation because the SOR lists five delinquent \ndebts that have not been resolved. Those debts are SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.h. \nWhile several accounts became delinquent over nine years ago, the SOR \u00b6 1.h account \ntransitioned to a delinquent status in February 2019. The surrounding circumstances \nthat Applicant described in explaining why she was not responsible for the five listed \naccounts generate continuing concerns about her current reliability and judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s job insecurity over the years, along with her marital problems that \nresulted in a 2019 divorce, were unanticipated conditions that exacerbated her financial \nproblems. However, she has been employed full time since October 2020, and earning \na good salary. Applicant has not established that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. There is no evidence showing that she established contact with the \ncreditors to explain her financial difficulties or attempt to negotiate and make partial \npayments on the debts. The debt repair company did little in the way of resolving the \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nlisted debts. In sum, Applicant receives mitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) for \nthe unanticipated conditions beyond her control. However, given the inconsistent \npositions she has taken throughout the security investigation regarding her \nresponsibility for several of the delinquent debts, she receives only limited mitigation \nunder the second prong of the condition. \nThere are also two prongs necessary to obtain full credit under AG \u00b6 20(c). The \nfirst is financial counseling. The record contains no evidence that Applicant participated \nin financial counseling. However, since 2019, Applicant testified that she has paid more \nattention to her finances. Her enrollment in a credit bureau monitoring application shows \nthat she is receiving financial assistance from a credible source. \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 20(c) requires a clear indication that an applicant \nhas control over her delinquent debts. With no documented action taken to address the \ndelinquent accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.h, there is no clear indication \nthat Applicant\u2019s finances are being resolved or under control. Applicant receives limited \nmitigation under both prongs of AG \u00b6 20(c). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) refers to a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve delinquent \ndebts. The Directive does not define \u2018good faith.\u2019 The DOHA Appeal Board has \nindicated that \u2018good faith\u2019 requires a showing of reasonableness, prudence, and \nadherence to duty or obligation. Therefore, an applicant must do more than merely \nshow she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or a statute of \nlimitations]) to claim the [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition]. ISCR Case No. 02-30304 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, \n2001)). \nApplicant is relying on a state limitations statute to avoid responsibility for the \nSOR debts because the debts have been removed from her credit report and are no \nlonger enforceable. Even though removed, the debts are still significant for security \nclearance purposes. See ISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016). \nRelying on the statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve \nfinancial delinquencies. See ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). \nHence, an administrative judge should consider the surrounding circumstances involved \nin how an applicant acquired the debt and how she failed to satisfy the debt in a timely \nfashion. ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 17, 2015). \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to \nestablish her case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d \nof debt repayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). While an applicant is not required to show that every debt \nlisted in the SOR is paid, the applicant must show that she has a plan for debt resolution \nand has taken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006).

However, other than the two written complaints that \nApplicant made in May 2019 and the documented entries in the credit reports, her \ndisputes lack documented proof to substantiate the grounds for the disputes. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant was 20 years old when she received her security clearance in 2008. \nIn 2014, she was interviewed about her delinquent debts and stated she had none. She \nhad no excuse for not being forthright. After her interview, she enrolled in a debt repair \nfirm with the objective of eliminating her delinquent debts. However, Applicant was 31 \nyears old when she indicated in her March 2019 e-QIP, that she had no delinquent \ndebts a second time. A month later, she took the same position because she thought \nher debt repair firm resolved the debts. Waiting for the statute of limitations to expire \nmaking her debts legally unenforceable, does not substitute for a payment plan and a \nmeaningful track record of payments toward debt resolution. Applicant has not taken \nsufficient action to address the listed delinquent debts. After a full review of the entire \nrecord from an overall common-sense point of view, in conjunction with the specific \nconditions and general factors of the whole-person concept, Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \n11 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.c, 1.e, 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.f, 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

(HE \n2) \nOn August 24, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested \na hearing. (HE 3) On October 29, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On \nFebruary 18, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On March 7, 2022, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for April \n22, 2022. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered 4 exhibits into evidence, and Applicant offered 11 \nexhibits into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 12-18; GE 1-GE 4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE \nK) There were no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. \n15-16) On May 5, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. The record was held \nopen until May 23, 2022, to enable Applicant to provide additional documentation. (Tr. \n113, 155) One post-hearing document was received and admitted without objection. (AE \nL) The record closed on May 23, 2022.   \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he partially admitted and partially denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i, 2.a, and 2.b. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating \ninformation. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old technical writer who has worked for two defense \ncontractors during the previous year. (Tr. 19, 21) He was unemployed in February and \nMarch 2022, and he began working for his current employer three weeks before his \nhearing. (Tr. 19-20) His current employer sponsored him for a security clearance. (Tr. 67) \nHe has been married 14 years and has two children ages 11 and 13. (Tr. 21) He honorably \nserved in the Marine Corps from 2006 to 2011. (Tr. 23, 25) Applicant and his spouse met \nwhen they were serving in the Marine Corps. (Tr. 21) His Marine Corps specialty was \navionics technician. (Tr. 21, 24) He was a sergeant when he left the Marine Corps. (Tr. \n73) \nIn 2004, Applicant graduated from high school, and in 2011, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in technical management. (Tr. 23, 25, 49-50) He had a 3.76 grade point \naverage in college, and he graduated Magna Cum Laude. (Tr. 25; AE K) \nApplicant loves to play golf. (Tr. 31) He coaches his son\u2019s baseball, football, and \nbasketball teams, which are sponsored by a recreation center. (Tr. 31; AE K) He \nvolunteers in his community.

(Tr. 28) In 2014, \nApplicant went on a mission trip to Ghana, and he and his spouse decided to try to adopt \nfrom an orphanage. (Tr. 32) After two years of background checks and paying almost \n$17,000, adoptions from Ghana to the United States were terminated. (Tr. 33, 81-83, 107) \nIn 2018, Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s father had dementia, and he moved in with Applicant and \nhis spouse. (Tr. 29) Applicant and his spouse\u2019s current gross annual income is about \n$200,000. (Tr. 61-62, 66, 98) They may have earned less in previous years. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse uses a budget and handles payment of the family bills. (Tr. 61, 79-80, 88, 92-93) \nHe and his spouse are receiving financial counseling at their church. (Tr. 62, 88) He and \nhis spouse purchased a house; however, it is listed in her name. (Tr. 64) \nThe February 25, 2021 SOR alleges six federal student loans placed for collection \ntotaling $94,179 as follows: \u00b6 1.a for $21,217; \u00b6 1.b for $21,063; \u00b6 1.c for $19,572; \u00b6 1.d \nfor $19,453; \u00b6 1.f for $6,420; and \u00b6 1.g for $6,420. (HE 2) The SOR alleges three \nadditional delinquent debts as follows: \u00b6 1.e is a charged-off credit union debt for $10,817; \n\u00b6 1.h is a charged-off debt for $520; and \u00b6 1.i is a utility debt placed for collection for $87. \n(Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s six SOR-alleged federal student-loan debts resulted from his college \nand post-graduate education. In 2011, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree after \nattending classes for two years while he was on active duty in the Marine Corps. (Tr. 52, \n68) In 2012, he started a master\u2019s degree program, and in 2013, he left his master\u2019s \nprogram after attending a university for four quarters. (Tr. 68-69) Applicant and his spouse \nestimated his student loans totaled about $40,000 rather than the $94,179 alleged in the \nSOR. (Tr. 50, 84, 111-112) Applicant had an education deferment for repayment of his \nstudent loans in 2012 to 2013 because he was taking classes towards a master\u2019s degree. \n(Tr. 35) Then he moved several times, and the account was transferred. (Tr. 56, 69) He \nnever made any student-loan payments. (Tr. 57, 69) \nI asked Applicant to provide documentation after the hearing showing the status of \nthe student loans to enable an assessment of whether some debts were duplications of \nother debts, and he provided the requested documentation. (Tr. 112-113; AE L) On March \n3, 2017, the Department of Education (D. Ed.) informed Applicant that he had three \ndelinquent student loans totaling $47,173 ($37,357 principal and $9,816 interest). (AE L) \nThe three student loans were: $19,545; $21,181; and $6,447, and they were made in \n2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. (Id.) The debts in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $21,217; SOR \u00b6 1.c \nfor $19,572; and SOR \u00b6 1.g for $6,420 are duplications of other SOR debts, and these \nthree debts are mitigated. \nIn 2019 or 2020, Applicant\u2019s federal income tax refund was transferred to pay a \nportion of his student-loan debt. (Tr. 57, 70) Repayment of his student loans was not a \npriority to him because of other issues, such as raising a family, adopting a child from \nGhana, and establishing his and his spouse\u2019s employments after leaving the Marine \nCorps. (Tr. 86) He was also waiting to see if the federal government would forgive his \nstudent-loan debt. (Tr. 58) He wanted to check to see if he could get a disability rating \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and then maybe he could use the disability \nrating to have some of his student loans forgiven. (Tr. 58) Applicant said he was working \non establishing a payment plan for his student loans. (Tr. 33) He and his spouse sent in \ntheir W-2s, 2019 and 2020 federal income tax returns, and other information to the D. Ed. \n(Tr. 33, 85; AE L) Applicant intends to initiate the D. Ed.\u2019s rehabilitation program to get \nhis loans out of default status. (Tr. 36, 85) The student-loan debts in SOR \u00b6 1.b for \n$21,063; SOR \u00b6 1.d for $19,453; and SOR \u00b6 1.f for $6,420 are unresolved. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse\u2019s student loans total about $55,000, and they are current. (Tr. 101, 105) \nIn March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the D. Ed. placed federal \nstudent loans in forbearance. (Tr. 36) On December 22, 2021, the D. Ed. extended the \nstudent loan payment pause through May 1, 2022. The pause includes the following relief \nmeasures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and \nstopped collections on defaulted loans. See Federal Student Aid website, \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. His student loans are not listed \non his April 12, 2022 credit report. (Tr. 36-37; GE 4) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a charged-off credit union debt for $10,817. Applicant \nand his spouse used the funds to rehabilitate a residence they received from his \ngrandfather to enable them to rent out the residence. (Tr. 38) The rent was insufficient to \ncover the mortgage, and the property was foreclosed in 2014 or 2015. (Tr. 59) The \nproperty was auctioned, and there is no deficiency balance on the mortgage because the \nmortgage was a VA-guaranteed loan. (Tr. 65-66) The VA did not seek any payment from \nApplicant. (Tr. 66) Applicant said he made four payments to address the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e; however, the creditor turned the debt over to collections. (Tr. 38-39) He said he is \nmaking $432 monthly payments to address the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. (Tr. 39, 86; AE E; AE \nF) He believed the current balance is about $5,900. (Tr. 50) They expect the debt to be \nresolved in March 2023. (Tr. 86) This debt is being resolved. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h is a charged-off debt for $520. Applicant said he paid the \ndebt. (Tr. 39) He disputed the status of the debt as indicated on his credit report. (Tr. 39) \nThis debt is resolved. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i is an $87 utility debt placed for collection. Applicant said he \npaid the debt when he learned about it. (Tr. 40, 87; AE G) This debt is resolved. \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant failed to disclose on his February 13, 2020 SCA the \ninformation in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i concerning his delinquent debts. Applicant did not \ndisclose any debts placed for collection or charged off in the previous seven years on his \nFebruary 13, 2020 SCA. (HE 2) \nApplicant said he completed an SCA in 2017, and then he changed employment. \n(Tr. 41-42) In 2020, he was supposed to complete his SCA because his 2017 SCA was \napparently not processed. (Tr. 43) For his 2020 SCA, he updated the employment history; \nhowever, he hurried through the remainder of the SCA and did not read the questions \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncarefully.

(Tr. 71-72) He compared \nit to completion of a medical questionnaire when one has an appointment with a physician. \nHe did not disclose his foreclosure or the other delinquent debts on his SOR. (Tr. 60; GE \n1) He was \u201ccomplacent\u201d about his SCA. (Tr. 72) He did not intend to deceive the \ngovernment. (Tr. 44) He held a security clearance for 17 years, and he did not believe his \nSCA or background raised any security issues. (Tr. 44) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant failed to disclose the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.i during his May 4, 2020 OPM PSI. (HE 2) He admitted that he told the OPM \ninvestigator he paid his bills on time and was not behind on any payments at the beginning \nof the financial interview. (Tr. 45, 54) When the investigator asked him about his student-\nloan debt, he admitted that he owed the student loans, and he had not made any \npayments since 2012. (GE 2 at 8) His tax refunds for two years were diverted to pay his \nstudent loans. (Id.) He suggested to the OPM investigator that he might receive some \nforgiveness of his student loans if the VA decided he was disabled. (Id.) He also discussed \nhis charged-off credit union debt for $10,817 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and he said he was in \nsettlement negotiations with the creditor. (Id. at 9) He did not intend to mislead the \ninvestigator about his finances. (Tr. 45) His failure to be scrupulously accurate was based \non complacency and his belief that his background did not raise any security issues. (Tr. \n45-46) He did not intend to conceal security-relevant information. \nApplicant promised to be more careful in his future completion of security \ndocuments and forms. (Tr. 47) He will ensure his answers are accurate and complete. \n(Tr. 47-48) He has served the United States faithfully for 17 years, and he would not \nintentionally falsify the information he provides to security officials. (Tr. 48) He believes \nhe can continue to provide valuable contributions to the nation\u2019s defense. (Tr. 48) \nCharacter Evidence \nFour character witnesses, including his spouse and three friends, made \nstatements supporting approval of his access to classified information. (Tr. 74-138) The \ngeneral sense of their statements is that Applicant is honest, diligent, loyal, patriotic, \nhelpful, and trustworthy. \nDuring his Marine Corps service, he received the following awards: Certificate of \nAppreciation; Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal; Letter of Appreciation; \nNational Defense Service Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; Marine Corps \nGood Conduct Medal; and Expert Rifle Badge (2). (Tr. 26; AE J) He completed several \nMarine Corps training courses.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d    \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is. well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant experienced unemployment, transition expenses after leaving the \nMarine Corps, and illness in his family, which are circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol, which adversely affected his finances.

Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); \nISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with several of his creditors or that he made offers to \nmake partial payments to them. \nApplicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.g as \nduplications of other SOR debts. He established payment plans or paid the debts in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i, and these three debts are also mitigated. \nApplicant is not credited with mitigating his student-loan debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, \nand 1.f. His latest credit reports do not show these three debts are delinquent. However, \nhe admitted he did not establish payment plans for these three debts. The absence of \nthese debts from his credit reports does not show meaningful evidence of mitigation. See \nMegan Leonhardt, \u201cFreezing student loan payments helped boost borrowers\u2019 credit \nscores,\u201d Fortune, (Mar. 4, 2022), https://fortune.com/2022/03/04/freezing-student-loan-\npayments-helped-boost-credit-scores/ (indicating credit reporting companies are bringing \nfederal student loans to current status because of Presidential orders). \nComplete reliance on the COVID-19 pandemic-based student loans deferment to \nestablish mitigation for security clearance purposes is misplaced. Applicant\u2019s student \nloans were delinquent from 2013 to 2020. See ISCR Case No. 20-03208 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJuly 6, 2021); ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021) (noting student\nloans totaling about $20,000 that were delinquent before the COVID-19 federal deferment\nmay be the basis for revocation of access to classified information). Applicant did not\nestablish he was unable to establish a payment plan and make some payments for\nseveral years before the federal deferment in 2020. See ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3\n(Aug. 25, 2015) (\u201cIndeed, even if a credit report states that a debt has been paid, that fact \nalone does not, in and of itself, resolve concerns arising from the dilatory nature of an \napplicant\u2019s response to his debts or other circumstances that detract from an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. In this case, the Judge commented on the absence of detailed \nevidence about how Applicant addressed his finances and reasonably had doubts about \nhis clearance eligibility based on that lack of evidence\u201d).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-payment of his federal student-loan debt from 2013 to \n2020 has important security implications.

Feb. 17, 2017)). \u201cA \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection \nof national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has \na direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nApplicant did not establish that he was unable to make more progress sooner in \nthe resolution of his student-loan debts. There is insufficient assurance that his financial \nproblems are being resolved. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation \nof financial considerations security concerns. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying including: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nIn ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence.

He raced \nthrough his SCA and checked the boxes answering no to financial questions without \nreading them because he assumed he did not have any financial information that raised \na security concern. Similarly, at the start of his OPM interview, he indicated his accounts \nwere current and he did not have any financial problems. When he was confronted with \nnegative financial information, he readily admitted his delinquent debt and provided \nexplanations. His spouse handles the family finances, and he was not focused on \nfinancial issues. His candid and forthright explanations at his hearing refuted personal \nconduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines E and \nF are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old technical writer who has worked for two defense \ncontractors during the previous year. He honorably served in the Marine Corps from 2006 \nto 2011. His Marine Corps specialty was avionics technician. He was a sergeant when he \nleft the Marine Corps. He received several awards and completed training courses while \nin the Marine Corps. In 2011, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in technical management. \nHe had a 3.76 grade point average in college, and he graduated Magna Cum Laude. He \ncompleted several courses towards a master\u2019s degree. He volunteers in his community. \nThe general sense of his character statements is that Applicant is honest, diligent, loyal, \npatriotic, helpful, and trustworthy. \nApplicant provided important mitigating information. His finances were harmed by \nseveral circumstances largely beyond his control.

He did not show a track record of consistent payments to address \nhis student loans. His financial history raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

Applicant successfully completed the \nprobation requirements, is no longer married, and has not had any alcohol-related \nproblems since early 2016. I conclude she has mitigated the security concern related to \nexcessive alcohol consumption. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems also stemmed from her troubled marriage. Although \nshe has made some progress in satisfying delinquent debts, she still owes significant tax \ndebts from 2013 and 2014, and she has yet to file her income tax returns from 2015 to \n2017. Under these circumstances, she has failed to mitigate the financial circumstances \nsecurity concern. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 20, 2021, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudication Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsiderations, and Guideline G, alcohol consumption.

On March 20, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting all of the allegations, \nand requesting a decision based on the documentary record, instead of a hearing. \nOn June 30, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM), containing eight attachments (Items 1 \u2013 8) in support of the SOR allegations. \nApplicant received a copy of the FORM on September 24, 2021, and was given until \nOctober 24, 2021 to file a reply. Applicant filed an undated reply. (Item 9) \nOn May 5, 2022, the case was assigned to me. After reviewing the file, I granted \nApplicant sua sponte an extension of the record through the close of business June 24, \n2022, to provide additional evidence towards resolving her income tax delinquencies. (See \nOrder (Item 10) On June 23, 2022, Applicant submitted a letter from her accountant, \ntogether with a two-page memorandum. (Item 11) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 49-year-old single woman. She was married from 2006 to 2018, when \nshe and her husband divorced. (Item 3 at 27) Applicant is a college graduate, earning a \ndegree in 1997. (Item 3 at 17) Since October 2018 she has been working for a defense \ncontractor as an engineer.

(Item 8 at 6 - 9) Applicant legally \ndivorced him in July 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s marital problems and subsequent divorce corresponded with her \nfinancial problems, as alleged in the SOR. Specifically, when Applicant prepared to file her \nfirst federal and state income tax returns after her 2018 divorce, she discovered that her \nex-husband, who was responsible for filing their income tax returns during the marriage, \nhad not filed their federal and state income tax returns from 2015 to 2017, and that she \nwas delinquent on her federal income taxes in the amount of $19,749 for tax years 2013 \nand 2014. (Answer at 1 -2; Item 8 at 6-7) \nIn April 2019, Applicant retained an accountant to help resolve her income tax \ndelinquencies. (Item 10 at 3) The accountant advised her to gather all of her old financial \nrecords so that he could review them and prepare the returns. This was a daunting task for \nApplicant because all of her old financial information were in the home where \u201cshe had fled \n. . .after a final altercation\u201d with her husband in October 2017. (Item 10 at 3) Nevertheless, \nApplicant, by December 2019, had largely contacted all of the entities, such as mortgage \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompanies, insurance companies, employers, and banks, that she needed to reconstruct \nher tax records for 2015 to 2017. (Item 10 at 3) \nAt or about the time Applicant was reconstructing her financial records, her \naccountant contacted her ex-husband to persuade him to file his income taxes under \n\u201cmarried filing joint\u201d status for tax years 2015 to 2017, explaining that filing jointly would \nresult in a larger deduction and a lower tax rate. (Item 2 at 4; Item 11 at 3) Applicant\u2019s ex-\nhusband initially agreed to provide whatever documents needed to file jointly, but never \nfollowed through. By December 2020, he had stopped responding to Applicant\u2019s \naccountant entirely. (Item 10 at 3) \nIn February 2022, Applicant\u2019s accountant characterized the filing of Applicant\u2019s back \ntax returns as \u201ccurrently in progress,\u201d and anticipated that they would be completed by April \n2022. (Item 9 at 2) In March 2022, Applicant\u2019s accountant drafted the tax returns for 2015 \nthrough 2017 for Applicant\u2019s review. By June 2022, 15 months after answering the SOR, \nApplicant had not yet filed the back tax returns for 2015 to 2017. Per her accountant, they \nanticipate filing these returns by late September 2022. (Item 11 at 1) \nApplicant contends that she has filed her tax returns for 2018 to 2021 and that \nrefunds have been applied to her delinquencies for earlier tax years. (Item 11 at 4) Per an \nIRS tax transcript, $1,608 of a refund received in 2019 was credited to Applicant\u2019s 2013 \ndelinquency. (Item 4 at 12) There is no additional documentary evidence of payments \ntoward the delinquencies on file. Applicant has not yet submitted a payment plan to the IRS \nfor the 2013 and 2014 tax delinquencies. (Item 11 at 4) \nApplicant incurred approximately $6,600 of delinquent consumer debts over the \nyears, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.d through 1.j. (Item 2 at 2) These debts became \ndelinquent in approximately 2015 when Applicant\u2019s then husband, upon whom she was \ndependent to help make ends meet, lost his job. (Item 8 at 8) \nAfter Applicant finalized her divorce and obtained a better-paying job in 2018, she \nbegan paying the delinquent bills. (Item 8 at 12) Subparagraph 1.d is a utility bill, totaling \n$512, Applicant satisfied this bill in February 2022. (Item 9 at 3) \nSubparagraph 1.e is a credit card bill, totaling $454. Applicant satisfied this bill in \nJanuary 2021, before the issuance of the SOR. (Item 9 at 4) \nSubparagraph 1.f is a credit card bill, totaling $3,916. By February 2021, before the \nissuance of the SOR, she had satisfied this debt. (Item 9 at 5) \nSubparagraph 1.g is a credit card bill, totaling $534. Applicant satisfied this debt in \nFebruary 2021, before the issuance of the SOR. (Item 9 at 6) \nSubparagraph 1.i is a credit card bill, totaling $1,203.

(Item 9 at 1) She provided no documentary evidence. \nWhile Applicant was married, she used alcohol to cope with the emotional trauma \ncaused by her husband\u2019s abusive behavior. (Item 8 at 7) Within a three-week period \nbetween December 2015 and January 2016, Applicant was arrested twice and charged \nwith operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. (Item 8 at 5) The second arrest \noccurred while the hearing for the first charge was pending. Before both arrests, applicant \nhad consumed two pints of vodka. (Item 8 at 5) Under a plea agreement, the second \ncharge was dismissed, and Applicant agreed to complete an alcohol education class, \ncomplete counseling, pay a fine, and serve 18 months of probation. (Item 9 at 2 at 5-6; \nItem 9 at 13-20) After Applicant completed the terms of the probation, the court dismissed \nthe charges. \nNow that Applicant is no longer married, she does not drink alcohol to excess. \nInstead, she drinks approximately two drinks per month, and spends her free time at the \ngym rather than at bars. (Item 8 at 6) She has not had any alcohol-related arrests or \ncharges since January 2016. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Moreover, \nher failure to file her income tax returns for 2015 to 2017, and her income tax \ndelinquencies trigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems stemmed from her marital separation and subsequent \ndivorce. She was not aware that her ex-husband had not been filing their joint income tax \nreturns during the marriage until she prepared to file her first tax return as a single person \nin 2018. Since Applicant finalized the divorce, she has satisfied all of her consumer debts, \ntotaling approximately $6,700. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) apply, and has been working with an \naccountant to resolve develop an income tax payment plan. I resolve subparagraphs 1.(c) \nthrough 1.(j) in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s marriage to an abusive husband significantly contributed to her financial \nproblems, and his stonewalling regarding the resolution of their tax delinquencies has \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s delay in resolving them. Conversely, it has been nearly two years \nsince Applicant concluded that her ex-husband was not going to cooperate with her in filing \njoint tax returns for 2015 through 2017, and it has been 15 months since the issuance of \nthe SOR, and Applicant has yet to file the returns. Moreover, Applicant has not submitted a \npayment plan to the IRS for payments of the 2013 and 2014 delinquencies, and the only \nsubstantiated payment toward those delinquencies is one payment of $1,608, applied \nthrough a refund from Applicant\u2019s 2019 tax return \nApplicant\u2019s situation with her ex-husband was compelling enough for me to take the \nunusual step of re-opening the record and extending it to allow her to provide progress \ntowards resolving her tax delinquencies. However, no matter how compelling the \ncircumstances that led to Applicant\u2019s financial problems, she still has the burden of proving \nthat her financial problems are under control. Given the amount of tax delinquencies that \nremain outstanding, and the number of years that she has yet to file the tax returns in \nquestion, I cannot conclude that she has mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcern. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21) Applicant\u2019s two alcohol-related arrests \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 22(a) \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as \ndriving while under the influence . . .,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder,\u201d apply. \nApplicant\u2019s heavy drinking corresponded with her troubled marriage. Applicant\u2019s \nmost recent alcohol-related arrest was nearly seven years ago, and she has been divorced \nfrom her husband, the catalyst for her excessive drinking, for four years.

He served in the military from 2004 to 2014 and received\nan honorable discharge. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He married in 2007 and \ndivorced in 2009.

In his August \n2019 security clearance application, he disclosed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f. \nHe stated that these debts were unresolved and he expected them to be removed from \nhis credit report at the end of the year.

He told the investigator he did not intend on paying these debts and was \nwaiting for them to fall off his credit report. He stated that his financial difficulties arose \nwhen he was discharged from the military (2014) and when his former spouse left him. \nHe said he had difficulties paying his bills. The debt is SOR \u00b6 1.a ($985) is a collection \naccount for a medical debt that became delinquent in 2016. (Items 3 and 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2021 answer to the SOR, he denied each alleged debt and said \nthe accounts were past the statute of limitations and no longer on his credit report. Credit \nreports from September 2019 and January 2020 reflect the delinquent debts. No other \nevidence was provided by Applicant. (Items 1, 4, and 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has six delinquent debts that he does not intend to pay because he is \nrelying on the statute of limitations. There is sufficient evidence to support the application \nof the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant stated that he experienced financial difficulties in about 2014. He \nacknowledged the legitimacy of the credit card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f, but does \nnot intend to pay them. He denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a for medical services that was \nincurred in 2016. Perhaps at one time, Applicant was unable to pay these debts due to \nhis financial situation. However, he has been steadily employed since 2016, and he \nclearly stated in his SCA, his background interview, and his answer to the SOR that he \ndoes not intend to pay his delinquent debts. He is relying on the statute of limitations and \nthe removal of debts from his credit reports after seven years to resolve these debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are unresolved and his failure to address them for \nyears casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He said \nhis financial situation arose when he was separated from his wife and had been \ndischarged from the military. The evidence reflects he was discharged in 2014 and he \ndivorced the same year. He failed to provide evidence that he acted responsibly once he \ngained employment in 2016. There is no evidence Applicant received financial counseling \nor made good-faith efforts to resolve his legitimate debts. To the contrary, he has ignored \nthem and is relying on the statute of limitations. He did not provide evidence that the debts \nare unsubstantiated. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe Appeal Board provides a summary regarding \u201cnon-collectable\u201d debts: \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the \npassage of time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited \nby any statute of limitations, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the \nmeaning of the Directive. A security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in making a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in \nincurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n17-01473 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan 19, 2011) \nApplicant\u2019s reliance on the statute of limitations to mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his numerous delinquent debts is misguided. Insufficient evidence was \nprovided, and he failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He completed treatment programs between November 2015 and April 2016 and \nagain from December 2019 to January 2020, for diagnosed severe alcohol abuse \ndisorder, and been abstinent from alcohol since December 5, 2019. He used cocaine \nbetween March 2014 and November 2015 in disregard of his security clearance \nobligations. He defaulted on several debts. He does not intend to drink alcohol or use \nillegal drugs in the future, but he has yet to fully mitigate the concerns for his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness in several aspects. Clearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 21, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline G, alcohol consumption; Guideline J, criminal conduct; Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse; Guideline E, personal conduct; and Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. The SOR explained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nOn May 26, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On February 7, 2022, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was \nready to proceed to a hearing. On February 24, 2022, the case was assigned to me to \nconduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I \nreceived the case file and assignment on March 1, 2022. \nApplicant was unavailable for a hearing proposed for June 6, 2022, because of a \nbusiness commitment that week. After some coordination with the parties, on June 28, \n2022, I scheduled a video teleconference hearing for July 19, 2022. At the hearing \nconvened as scheduled, six Government exhibits (GE 1 through 6) and two Applicant \nexhibits (AE A and B) were admitted into the record without any objections. A February \n3, 2022 letter from Department Counsel forwarding copies of the proposed GEs to \nApplicant, was provided but not marked for the record as Applicant confirmed that he \nreceived the exhibits. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received \non July 28, 2022. \nI held the record open for three weeks after the hearing to allow Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional exhibits. On July 19, 2022, Applicant submitted by email \nhis entire treatment record from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Given that a \nsignificant portion of the records was duplicative of AE B, I asked him to submit only the \nrelevant medical records not already in evidence. On August 6, 2022, Applicant submitted \nVA records focused on the period from 2015 and 2016. The document was admitted as \nAE C without any objections. The record closed on August 8, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR \u00b6 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline \nJ (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 4.b) that Applicant was convicted of driving under \nthe influence (DUI) or operating under the influence (OUI) offenses committed in July \n2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), April 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and August 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Also under \nGuideline G, Applicant allegedly consumed alcohol at times to excess and to intoxication \nsince about 2013 to at least December 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); was separated from the Army \nNational Guard Reserve (ARNG) because of his alcohol-related offenses; and received \ntreatment from November 2015 to January 2016 for diagnosed addictive disorder-alcohol \nabuse and attention deficit disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and from February 2016 to April 2016 for \nsubstance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 3.a), and cross-alleges under\nGuideline J (SOR \u00b6 2.b), that Applicant used cocaine with varying frequency from about \nSeptember 2013 to at least September 2015 while granted access to classified \ninformation (SOR \u00b6 3.b).  His use of cocaine while granted access to classified information \nwas also cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 4.a). Also under Guideline E, Applicant \nallegedly falsified his June 30, 2018 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (hereafter SF 86) by responding negatively to inquiries concerning any \ndelinquency regarding routine accounts (SOR \u00b6 4.c). Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges \nthat Applicant owed, as of May 21, 2021, three charged-off debts for $24,833 (SOR \u00b6 \n5.a), $\n 830 (SOR \u00b6 5.b), and $53 (SOR \u00b6 5.i); and eight collection debts for $185 (SOR \u00b6 \n5.c), $572 (SOR \u00b6 5.d), $1,493 (SOR \u00b6 5.e), $619 (SOR \u00b6 5.f), $1,188 (SOR \u00b6 5.g), $567 \n(SOR \u00b6 5.h), $3,923 (SOR \u00b6 5.j), and $469 (SOR \u00b6 5.k). \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations but indicated \nthat he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86. Applicant asserted that he had abstained \nfrom alcohol since December 5, 2019; that he sought help for his depression and is on \nmental-health medications; and that he had paid off some of the delinquent debts, \nincluding the debt in SOR \u00b6 5.a. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to abusing alcohol and committing drunk-driving offenses; \nto receiving treatment for the diagnosed conditions; and to having owed the delinquent \ndebts are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, \nexhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old high school graduate with some online college study. \n(GE 1.) He has never married, but he has had a cohabitant girlfriend for the past five \nyears. She has two children, ages 17 and 20, who live with them. (Tr. 29, 32, 81.) \nApplicant has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since about June \n2017. (GE 1.) \nApplicant enlisted in the ARNG at age 17 in April 2004 (Tr. 32-33), and he served \nuntil February 2016, when he was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions \nbecause he had tested positive for cocaine and alcohol in a routine ARNG screening. (Tr. \n35.) He appealed the character of his discharge, and it was later changed to honorable \nbased on his military service record. (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 35-36.) He was activated twice to \ncombat duty: from May 2006 through April 2007 and from July 2008 to May 2009. (AE B; \nTr. 33.) He was granted a security clearance shortly before his second deployment. (Tr. \n34.) On his return from active duty, he worked full time for his state\u2019s ARNG, which included \na deployment overseas from October 2012 to August 2013. (AE C.) In September 2013, \nhe lost his full-time job with the ARNG. He indicated on his June 2018 SF 86 that funding \nfor his full-time position with the ARNG ran out, but his medical records from the VA \nindicate that his job loss was because of his July 2013 DUI.

His \ndrinking to excess started in the summer of 2007. After he returned from being deployed, \nhe initially consumed alcohol in quantity of 30 beers and 750 ml of liquor per week. (AE \nC.) He eventually moderated his consumption to social drinking, about twice a week, until \nabout April 2013. After he and his then-fianc\u00e9e called off their relationship three months \nbefore they were to marry (Tr. 37), he began to turn to alcohol, often nightly, to self-\nmedicate for mental-health issues. (AE C; Tr. 25.) \nAfter drinking four to five alcohol drinks while out at a casino with family members \none evening in July 2013, Applicant was stopped by police for swerving. He failed field \nsobriety tests and was arrested for DUI. He pled guilty, was granted accelerated \nrehabilitation, placed on probation, and ordered to complete 100 hours of community \nservice and alcohol counseling. The charge was dismissed after he completed the terms. \n(GE 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s July 2013 DUI was a factor in him losing his full-time job with the ARNG \naround September 2013. He drank 750 ml of vodka per night early that winter before his \nfamily intervened in January 2014, and he attended a two-week alcohol program. (AE C.) \nFrom March 2014 to November 2014, he worked as a part-time bartender. (GEs 1, 2.) He \ndrank alcohol at times to excess and used cocaine intermittently in combination with \nalcohol in that job. (Tr. 26, 44.) He used cocaine as the drug helped him sober up more \nquickly from drinking. He found that the drug helped him drink more. (Tr. 42.) \nApplicant consumed five to six alcohol drinks and three to four shots of liquor on \nApril 18, 2014, while talking with patrons and then cleaning up with his manager after \nclosing the bar. While driving home, he was stopped by the police, who smelled alcohol \non his breath. He failed a breathalyzer and was arrested for DUI. (GEs 1-2.) Available \nrecords from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicate a re-arrest date of October \n25, 2014; a disposition date of January 14, 2015; and a sentence of six months in jail, \nsuspended, a $500 fine, one year of probation, and 100 hours of community service. (GE \n6.) \nApplicant was seen at a VA health center in May 2014 and referred to the facility\u2019s \nsubstance-abuse clinic. He reported an escalation of alcohol use following two \ndeployments and use of alcohol to avoid his mental-health problems. A toxicology screen \nof May 8, 2014 was positive for cocaine. While attending substance-abuse outpatient \nprograms at the VA between July 2014 and September 2014, he continued to drink \nalcohol once a week, about two to four drinks each time. His drinking adversely affected \nhis relationship with his family between April 2014 and February 2015. (AE C.) \nApplicant was unemployed from about November 2014 to June 2015. He was not \nengaged in any substance-abuse treatment nor seeing a psychiatrist during that time. \n(GE 1; AE C; Tr. 25.) On March 6, 2015, he presented at a VA clinic for a medical \nscreening for a research study.

He was charged with DUI and \nwith probation violation (two counts). (GE 6.) He testified that he was charged with being \na two-time first offender for the April 2014 and August 2015 DUIs in that he faced one \nDUI charge for the August 2015 offense with the ramifications of two DUIs. (Tr. 38.) FBI \nrecords show that, on April 27, 2016, he was convicted of the August 2015 DUI and of \nthe violation of probation charges. On May 4, 2016, he was sentenced on the DUI charge \nto six months in jail, one year of probation, and a $500 fine. He had to serve only ten days \nin jail as the court accepted his attendance at a substance-abuse treatment program in \nlieu of jail time. He was sentenced on the probation violation counts to two days in jail for \neach offense, to serve concurrently. (GE 6; AE C.) He was also required to have an \ninterlock-type device in his vehicle. (GE 2; Tr. 28.) He testified that he fulfilled the terms \nof his sentence, and the device was removed. (Tr. 78.) \nOn September 17, 2015, Applicant went to a VA mental-health clinic seeking \nsubstance-abuse treatment. He reported some anxiety and exhibited some signs of \nminimization of the harm drinking had caused him. He reported drinking \u201conly six drinks\u201d \nbefore his August 2015 DUI. He was placed on a trial dose of Lexapro and referred to an \noutpatient alcohol and substance abuse program. (AE C.) \nDuring a follow-up visit with his treating psychiatrist at his local VA clinic on October \n19, 2015, Applicant reported he had completed seven sessions of substance-abuse \ntreatment and had abstained from alcohol. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder \nand PTSD (rule out), and was continued on Lexapro. (AE C.) \nApplicant quit working at the bar in November 2015 to focus on his alcohol \nrehabilitation. (GE 1.) On November 23, 2015, he went to a VA medical center\u2019s \npsychiatric emergency department accompanied by his ARNG supervisor. Applicant had \nbeen late to a military drill because of intoxication, after having consumed a gallon of \nalcohol. He reported binge drinking of six to eight beers plus 750 ml of vodka or rum every \nthree weeks and consumption of lesser amounts several times per week, to as recently \nas November 20, 2015. He complained of symptoms of PTSD and requested substance-\nabuse treatment. He was admitted for observation for 23 hours, and was diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder (binge pattern) and PTSD.

(AE C.) \nWhile residing in a sober-housing situation, Applicant received follow-up recovery-\nsupport treatment in a VA intensive outpatient program (IOP) from December 2, 2015, to \nDecember 23, 2015, for diagnosed alcohol use disorder (severe) and PTSD. In reviewing \nhis options for follow-up care with his recovery support team on December 17, 2015, \nApplicant expressed a desire to continue individual therapy to address his negative life \nexperiences, as his felt his alcohol and drug use stemmed from \u201cdefective ability to cope.\u201d \nHe did not believe group substance-abuse treatment would be helpful to him, although \nmedical records show that he had demonstrated active listening skills in group sessions. \nHe was discharged on December 23, 2015, to follow-up with counseling until a dual-\ndiagnosis program became available, and to continue with his VA psychiatrist. At \ndischarge, Applicant indicated that he was \u201cconsiderably\u201d confident in his ability to abstain \nfrom alcohol and drugs. He denied any cravings to use alcohol or drugs in the prior 30 \ndays. (AE C.) \nDuring a session with his VA psychiatrist on January 12, 2016, Applicant reported \nthat he had abstained from alcohol for 50 days with no cravings. On January 26, 2016, \nhe was determined to be not a good candidate for a certain dual-diagnosis program \nbecause his medical record did not adequately support the PTSD diagnosis. He was \naccepted into another program through the VA to start on May 26, 2016, or earlier, if a \nslot became available. (AE C.) \nApplicant agreed to participate in a once-weekly continuing care program at the \nVA, but he never started the program. He told the VA he was on active-duty orders \nthrough February 23, 2016, and was unable to attend. In lieu of that program, he attended \nindividual therapy outside the VA setting. His therapist advised the VA that, after six \nweeks of therapy, she considered Applicant to be in the \u201cpre-contemplative stage\u201d \nregarding his drinking and in some denial. VA records show that Applicant consumed \nalcohol on at least February 14, 2016. (AE C.) \nOn March 4, 2016, Applicant was admitted to a six-week specialized inpatient dual-\ndiagnosis program at a VA facility for diagnosed alcohol dependence and PTSD. A \nbreathalyzer test on admission was negative for any alcohol. Applicant interacted well \nwith peers and staff and attended all groups and classes with good participation. Clinical \nopinion was positive for Applicant\u2019s development of goals toward an overall improvement \nin his lifestyle and his challenges. He was discharged as scheduled on April 15, 2016, \nwith a plan to continue cognitive behavioral therapy with his private therapist. During a \npsychiatric visit at the VA on April 19, 2016, Applicant reported that he had maintained \nsobriety. (AE C.) \nOn May 16, 2016, Applicant was assessed at the VA to see if an increase in his \nservice-connected disability was warranted due to his mental-health issues.

(AE C.) \nApplicant became employed as a clerk at a gas station in June 2016. He was fired \nin March 2017 for a violation of his employer\u2019s policies unrelated to drinking. (GEs 1-2.) \nApplicant then held a part-time job in maintenance for a daycare facility until he started \nhis current employment in June 2017. (GE 1.) He denies any drinking around that time, \nbut admits that he did not take his recovery as seriously as he should have. (Tr. 26.-27.) \nAfter not drinking for approximately 18 months (AE C), he began drinking socially, \u201ca drink \nnow and then at dinner,\u201d in the summer of 2017. (Tr. 47.) Applicant thought he could \ncontrol his drinking. (Tr. 50.) \nOn his June 2018 SF 86, Applicant disclosed that he received treatment for PTSD \nfor about two months in 2016. He listed his three DUIs and one violation of probation \noffense. Concerning an SF 86 inquiry into whether his use of alcohol had any negative \nimpact on his work performance, professional or personal relationships, his finances, or \nresulted in law enforcement intervention, Applicant indicated that, in addition to the DUIs, \nalcohol caused him problems between September 2013 and September 2015 in that his \nrelationships with family and friends suffered. He disclosed that he had participated in \nalcohol-rehabilitation programs at the VA between November 2015 and January 2016. \n(GE 1.) \nIn response to an SF 86 illegal drug inquiry, he reported that he used cocaine \ninfrequently and only when drinking between September 2013 and September 2016. He \nresponded affirmatively to an SF 86 inquiry into whether his drug use occurred when he \npossessed a security clearance. He explained that he self-medicated with alcohol and \nsometimes cocaine when he was in a \u201crough place\u201d in his life, but that he had checked \nhimself into rehabilitation, was taking medications to control his PTSD, and going to \nsupport groups for his PTSD. He added that he had ended all ties to people who use \nillegal drugs and drink heavily, and he denied any intention of returning to that lifestyle. \n(GE 1.) \nOn August 10, 2018, Applicant had a personal subject interview (PSI) with an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He related that \nhe was drinking alcohol, despite previous treatment for alcohol use. He described his \ncurrent consumption as one or two drinks per month at family functions, usually \ncelebrations, which he did not consider to be abusive. He stated that he would \u201cnever\u201d \nagain consume alcohol to the point where it impacted him negatively. (GE 2.) \nAs for his cocaine use, Applicant recalled during his PSI that he last used cocaine \naround September 2015 and not September 2016. He stated that he used cocaine about \nfive times, in bar settings, while he held a security clearance. He denied any intention to \nuse cocaine in the future because of his \u201ccurrent career\u201d and stated that he had no \nongoing association with individuals who use the drug. (GE 2.) Applicant now asserts that \nhis cocaine use occurred between September 2014 and September 2015, when a \npositive drug screen for cocaine led to his discharge from the ARNG in February 2016. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Tr. 41.) VA records show he tested positive for cocaine on May 18, 2014, and again on \nNovember 22, 2015. (AE C.) He now recalls that he first used cocaine on his birthday in \nMarch 2014 and last used cocaine before he entered the dual-diagnosis program, which \nVA records show started on March 4, 2016. (AE C; Tr. 44) He told the clinicians in the \ndual-diagnosis program that he last used cocaine on November 22, 2015. The evidence \nsubstantiates that he used cocaine on occasion between March 2014 and at least \nNovember 2015 rather than from September 2013 to September 2015 as reported on his \nSF 86, or from September 2014 to September 2015 as stated during his PSI. \nApplicant\u2019s drinking eventually progressed to every other day after work. He \ntestified at his hearing that it was not that he lacked control over his drinking at that time, \nbut he \u201cthought it was on that path.\u201d (Tr. 47-49.) On December 5, 2019, Applicant \ncontacted his VA psychiatrist and reported that \u201cthe drinking started back up\u201d and that his \nmental-health medications were ineffective. He had not been taking his psychiatric \nmedications. (AE B.) \nOn December 10, 2019, Applicant voluntarily sought treatment in the psychiatric \nemergency room at the VA for his alcohol use disorder. He felt that he could not stop \ndrinking on his own and could not safely undergo detoxification at home. (Tr. 49-50.) He \nwas admitted overnight for observation prior to entering a substance-abuse day program. \nA drug screen of December 10, 2019, detected no presence of illegal drugs. He reported \na last use of cocaine some four years prior, but recent use of alcohol to a last use on \nDecember 5, 2019. He described his drinking as \u201cgetting out of hand.\u201d He used alcohol \nto address issues of insomnia and anxiety, and reported consuming two bottles of vodka \nevery two to three days preceding his last use. He was discharged to a recovery-support \nprogram on December 11, 2019, with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. He was not \naccepted for admission to a higher level of residential treatment as clinical opinion was \nthat his needs could be met at the lower level of care. (AE B.) \nApplicant attended a recovery-support program, which included group day \nsessions starting December 12, 2019, in the same substance-abuse rehabilitation \nprogram he had attended in 2015. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, \nuncomplicated. His family and friends were supportive of his recovery, and he felt \nextremely confident throughout treatment that he would not use alcohol or illegal drugs. \nInitially, he reported that he was slightly bothered by cravings or urges to use alcohol. He \nattended and participated in all aspects of the program, including group sessions of \nDecember 17, 2019, in which the importance of medication compliance was stressed, \nand December 30. 2019, in which attending self-help meetings after discharge was \nencouraged. He remained abstinent from alcohol and illegal drugs, as confirmed by \nnegative urine screens and breathalyzer tests. Clinicians assessed him as able to identify \nand discuss triggers and urges, and having developed good coping skills to avoid relapse. \nApplicant requested to follow up the program in an evening IOP outside the VA network. \nAt discharge to his home on January 6, 2020, he was referred to a community resource \nfor assistance with securing an IOP.

Concerning his mental-health medications, he admitted \nthat he had discontinued taking his Depakote on his own. He was continued on Adderall \nand cleared to return to work. (AE B.) \nApplicant testified that he attended an IOP three nights per week for two months. \n(Tr. 27, 51.) Records of that program are not in evidence. In response to interrogatories, \non January 21, 2021, Applicant stated that his alcohol and drug use was \u201cmore of an \nescape from underlying PTSD issue.\u201d He indicated that he was \u201cseeking counseling for \nmental health due to PTSD still.\u201d (GE 2.) \nOn July 27, 2020, Applicant was diagnosed by the VA with adult attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He currently takes bupropion for a mood disorder \ndiagnosed in February 2021 and Ritalin for his ADHD. (AEs B-C; Tr. 79.) He is currently \non a maintenance schedule where he sees his VA-appointed psychiatrist every two or \nthree months. He is not currently receiving therapy from a therapist. He last saw the \nprivate therapist in Spring 2021, and he has been looking for a new therapist without \nsuccess. (Tr. 51, 84.) He has requested an appointment with his VA psychiatrist because \nof increased depression over the last month. (Tr. 80.) Notwithstanding his history of \ndrinking to self-medicate mental-health issues, he does not believe he is at risk of \nrelapsing into alcohol. (Tr. 80.) \nApplicant is not involved in any self-help meetings such as Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA), but he has participated about once a week in an online program Smart Recovery, \nwhich he states instructs on \u201cmore modern coping skills and techniques.\u201d (Tr. 52-53.) He \nsigned onto Smart Recovery in January 2020. (Tr. 53.) He denies any consumption of \nalcohol since December 5, 2019, and any intention to drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 27-\n28.) His girlfriend and family are his primary support system. (Tr. 53.) He testified that his \njob is also a significant deterrent to relapse. (Tr. 81.) \nFinances \nApplicant\u2019s finances began to suffer around 2014 and 2015, when he was drinking \nheavily. He testified that all of his money went to fight cancer. (Tr. 54.) Available VA \nrecords do not show a cancer diagnosis (AEs B-C), and he presented no evidence of \nmedical payments. Periods of unemployment were a factor in him being unable to meet \nsome of his expenses. (Tr. 54.) \nApplicant responded affirmatively on his June 2018 SF 86 to inquiries into any \ndelinquency involving enforcement. He listed one debt of $20,000, for which his pay was \ngarnished. At the time, he believed it was a credit-card debt, but he recalled during his \nAugust 2018 PSI that it was a car-loan deficiency balance. (GE 2.)

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant drank excessively after he returned from his first deployment in 2007. At \nsome point not clear in the record, he limited his drinking to social settings about twice a \nweek. After he and his then-fianc\u00e9e ended their relationship around April 2013, he turned \nto alcohol to self-medicate for PTSD and other mental-health challenges. His first DUI in \nJuly 2013 had little impact on moderating his drinking, as by late 2013, he was consuming \n750 ml of vodka nightly until his family intervened. He attended a two-week alcohol \nprogram in early 2014, but in March 2014, he started working at a bar. It led directly to his \nsecond DUI. He continued to drink alcohol on a weekly basis, about two to four drinks at \na sitting, while attending outpatient programs at the VA during the summer of 2014. During \na lengthy period of unemployment from November 2014 to June 2015, he was not \nengaged in any substance-abuse treatment nor seeing a psychiatrist for his mental-health \nissues. VA records show that in early March 2015, he reported that his drinking had \nrecently been \u201cout of control.\u201d In August 2015, he took a position as a bar \nmanager/bartender, which exacerbated his drinking. He committed his third DUI shortly \nthereafter. Prior to the disposition of his April 2014 and August 2015 charges, he went to \nthe VA in mid-September 2015, seeking substance-abuse treatment. At the time, he \nexhibited some denial of his alcohol problem. He reported that he had consumed \u201conly \nsix drinks\u201d before his August 2015 DUI. \nBy mid-November 2015, Applicant had developed severe alcohol use disorder. \nAfter he reported for a military drill intoxicated, he went to the VA with his military superior \non November 23, 2015, requesting substance-abuse treatment. Psychiatrically stable, he \nwas discharged the following day for immediate admission to a private inpatient alcohol-\nrehabilitation facility. After a safe detoxification, he was discharged to an IOP at the VA \nwhere he then received treatment for diagnosed alcohol use disorder (severe) and PTSD. \nOn his discharge from that program on December 23, 2015, he indicated that he was \n\u201cconsiderably\u201d confident in remaining abstinent. Yet, VA medical records reflect that he \ntested positive for alcohol on February 14, 2016. \nApplicant fully participated in a dual-diagnosis program for PTSD and alcohol use \ndisorder from March 4, 2016, through April 15, 2016. He maintained abstinence for some \n18 months until the summer of 2017, when he began to drink socially. He became \ncomplacent about his alcohol problem, and his drinking progressed over time to every \nother day after work. After drinking two bottles of vodka in the days leading up to \nDecember 5, 2019, he turned to the VA for help arresting his drinking. He attended a \nrecovery support program from December 12, 2019, to January 6, 2020. He indicates that \nhe followed up in a two-month IOP. The records of that treatment are not in evidence, but \nI have no reason to doubt that he had the treatment. He denies any consumption of \nalcohol since December 5, 2019, and there is no evidence to the contrary. Even so, his \nhistory of excessive alcohol consumption establishes the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nVA medical records reflect that Applicant\u2019s drinking was a factor in both the loss of \nhis full-time employment with the ARNG and his early discharge from the ARNG. He \nshowed up to a drill weekend in an intoxicated state around November 2015. AG \u00b6 22(b) \n(\u201calcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or \nimpaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the welfare and safety of others, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder\u201d) cannot be \nconsidered as a separate basis for disqualification because it was not alleged. It is \nproperly considered as an episode of excessive drinking alleged under SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nhowever. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15 of the Directive, Applicant has the burden to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 23 have some applicability: \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nWhen Applicant sought substance-abuse treatment in November 2015, he was \nfacing possible jail time for his DUIs and negative consequences for his ARNG career. \nThe records of his inpatient detoxification at the private facility from November 24, 2015, \nto December 1, 2015, are not in evidence.

Applicant is credited under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) \nand 23(d) with seeking help for his alcohol problem at the VA on December 10, 2019, and \nattending a recovery-support program from December 12, 2019, to January 6, 2020. In \ncontrast to his previous rehabilitation efforts during the 2015 to 2016 timeframe when he \ntested positive for alcohol on February 14, 2016, he remained abstinent from alcohol and \nillegal drugs, as confirmed by testing during the recovery-support program. He fully \ncommitted himself to this treatment in that VA clinicians indicate that, by the time of his \ndischarge, he was able to identify and discuss triggers, and had developed good coping \nskills to avoid relapse. As of his June 2022 security clearance hearing, he had been \nabstinent from alcohol for about 2\u00bd years. \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, severe, is based on the criteria used \nby qualified medical professionals from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5). It means he met at least six of eleven symptoms for an \nalcohol use disorder. Under the DSM 5 criteria for remission, he would be considered to \nbe in sustained remission in that he had not exhibited any of the criteria for alcohol use \ndisorder in more than one year. However, for his remission to be considered stable under \nthe DSM, he would have to be free from any of the criteria of alcohol use disorder for over \nfive years. Nothing in the AGs ties mitigation to the DSM criteria, but the DSM is instructive \nas it sheds some light on how professionals view alcohol use disorder. \nGiven the severity of Applicant\u2019s alcohol use disorder and medical evidence \nshowing he was repeatedly advised to abstain, the issue becomes whether his present \n2\u00bd years free from alcohol is sufficient to demonstrate a clear and established pattern of \nabstinence. I have to consider his alcohol use in light of his history of self-medicating with \nalcohol to address his PTSD and depression. Applicant testified to an exacerbation of his \ndepression in the month preceding his hearing. He exhibited good judgment by requesting \nan appointment with his VA psychiatrist rather than turning to alcohol. Some concern \npersists in that he does not have any current clinical support from a therapist or a self-\nhelp group and relies solely on an online program. He had not seen a therapist since \nabout February 2021, and more than a year later, was still looking for a therapist. His \nrecent promotion at work with a considerable increase in salary may provide a significant \ndeterrent against relapse, but it is no guarantee. He would have had a stronger case in \nmitigation had he provided a recent, favorable assessment from a qualified clinician \nindicating that he will be able to sustain his sobriety with only the support of his family and \ngirlfriend in light of his ongoing mental-health challenges. Applicant presented important \nmitigating information, but it falls short of fully mitigating the alcohol consumption security \nconcerns. Despite having attended several treatment programs, he exhibited some \nminimization of his alcohol problem at his hearing in that he testified that his drinking was \nnot out of control when he sought treatment in December 2019, even though evidence \nshows, and he admits, that he drank four bottles of vodka over four days in early \nDecember 2019. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or unwillingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s three DUIs and violation of probation trigger one or \nmore of the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) merits some discussion with respect to Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine \nbetween March 2014 and November 2015. Cocaine is a Schedule II controlled substance \nunder federal law pursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule \nII drugs are those which have a high potential for abuse; have a currently accepted \nmedical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with \nsevere restrictions; and abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. \nSection 844 under Title 21 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to \nknowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid \nprescription. Federal law prohibits the possession of cocaine. It does not expressly \ncriminalize the \u201cuse,\u201d but Applicant was in physical possession of cocaine when he used \nit. VA medical records indicate that he made sure that his cocaine dealer was available \nwhen he and his co-workers at the bar wanted the drug. The Appeal Board has held that \nthe SOR is an administrative pleading that is not judged by the strict standards of a \ncriminal indictment. See, e.g. ISCR 12-11375 at 6 (App. Bd. June 17, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 99-0554 at 4 (July 24, 2000)). Applicant was placed on sufficient notice that his \ncocaine involvement raised criminal conduct security concerns. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 31(b) \nis implicated by his cocaine use and possession. \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32(a) have some applicability in this case. \nThey are: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including, but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe absence of any drunk-driving offense or any cocaine involvement in the last \nsix years is some evidence in reform. Applicant is reported to have shown up for a drill \nweekend impaired by alcohol around November 2015, but the record before me does not \nindicate whether he drove himself to the drill weekend. Applicant was not asked whether \nhe has operated a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol since his August 2015 DUI \narrest. With respect to his use of cocaine, Applicant has not worked at a bar since \nNovember 2015, and he no longer associates with those persons with whom he used \ncocaine in the past. Even so, for the reasons discussed under Guidelines G and H, the \ncriminal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. Applicant testified that he \ncomplied with the terms of his criminal sentences. He provided no documentation in that \nregard. He was required to have an interlock-type device on his vehicle, and while he \ntestified that it was removed some time ago, his credit report indicates that a $148 \ncollection debt for his device from February 2020 was unpaid as of July 2022. Such \ninformation raises some doubt as to whether he complied with the terms of his sentence \non time. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth \nin AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant used cocaine intermittently between March 2014 and November 2015. \nAG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d is established. At the time, he held a security \nclearance for his duties in the ARNG. However, it is unclear whether he accessed \nclassified information during that time. He had already lost his full-time position with the \nARNG. In ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022), the Appeal Board \nstated: \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for access to classified information and the granting of access to \nclassified material are not synonymous concepts. There are separate \ndeterminations. The issuance of a security clearance is a determination that \nan individual is eligible for access to classified national security information \nup to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone does not grant an \nindividual access to classified materials. In order to gain access to specific \nclassified materials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a \nsecurity clearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure agreement \nand have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See Executive Order 13526, dated December \n29, 2009, at \u00a7 4.1. While an eligibility determination is generally made at the \nagency level and is subject to various regulatory due process requirements, \nan access determination is most often made at the local level without any \ndue process guarantees. \nAs I read the Board\u2019s holding in that regard, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is not enough to establish AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d Not enough is known \nabout Applicant\u2019s weekend drilling duties to conclude that he had access to classified \nduties or held a sensitive position between March 2014 and November 2015 when he \nused cocaine. \nAG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia,\u201d is triggered only in that he physically possessed cocaine to use it. It was \nnot alleged that Applicant kept cocaine around, that he paid for the drug, or that he ever \nsold or distributed the drug. Medical records indicate that he may have had a cocaine \ndealer, but the information came to light only on review of the VA records submitted in \nevidence after his hearing. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation of drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nillegal \ndrug \ninvolvement \nand \nsubstance \nmisuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine was noted by the VA during his various treatment \nprograms, Applicant was never diagnosed with a cocaine abuse problem. However, his \ncocaine involvement is aggravated by the fact that it occurred while he held a security \nclearance for his ARNG duties. He had lost his full-time position in the ARNG before he \nstarted using cocaine, but he violated his obligations as a clearance holder by using \ncocaine. He asserts that he has disassociated himself from known drug users, and \nexpressed an intention to avoid any cocaine use in the future. There is no evidence that \nhe used cocaine during his serious and lengthy alcohol relapse from 2017 to December \n2019. Nonetheless, some concern arises that Applicant may have minimized the extent \nof his cocaine use during his PSI and at his hearing. He told an OPM investigator in \nAugust 2018 that he used the drug three to five times for experimentation. He claimed he \nwas alone in bar settings when using the drug. At his hearing, he testified that he was \nintroduced to cocaine at the bar when he was drinking. He described his use of cocaine \nas intermittent. (Tr. 44.) He tested positive for cocaine in a drug screen. A May 21, 2016 \nclinical note in his VA records indicates, \u201che reportedly hired his cocaine dealer to work \nwith him and his staff so that they could have access to him as needed.\u201d (Tr. 63.) It \nsuggests more of an involvement with cocaine than he is willing to admit. Furthermore, \nhis employment of a drug dealer may have facilitated the illegal drug involvement of other \nbar employees. The drug involvement and substance abuse security concerns are not \nfully mitigated under the circumstances. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15, which \nprovides: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that the same conduct can be alleged under different \nguidelines and weighed differently. Guideline E security concerns are raised by his \ndisregard of his clearance obligation to remain drug free. His recidivist DUIs and use of \ncocaine with a clearance support \u201ca whole-person assessment of questionable judgment\u201d \nunder AG \u00b6 16(c), which states: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe SOR also alleges under Guideline E that Applicant deliberately falsified his \nJune 2018 SF 86 by responding negatively to the financial inquiries regarding any \ndelinquency on routine accounts. Although Applicant admits that he answered \u201cNo,\u201d he \ndenies any intent to falsify his application. \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish a falsification, it is not \nenough merely to demonstrate that an applicant\u2019s answers were not true or accurate. To \nraise security concerns under Guideline E, the responses must be deliberately false. In \nanalyzing an applicant\u2019s intent, the administrative judge must consider an applicant\u2019s \nanswers in light of the record evidence as a whole. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05005 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017). \nA reasonable inference of intentional omission could be drawn from the objective \nevidence of the delinquent accounts listed on his July 2018 credit report. Applicant listed \nhis largest debt (SOR \u00b6 5.a) on his SF 86 as a debt involving enforcement because his \nwages were being garnished for the debt. He was still required to list it as a routine \ndelinquency, but he failed to do so. However, he obviously did not conceal that debt. With \nregard to the other obligations, it was not shown that Applicant knew about the debts and \nchose not to list them. While he responded negatively to the questions regarding any \nroutine delinquencies, he added on his SF 86, \u201cBesides previously stated not that I can \nremember.\u201d When confronted about the delinquencies on his credit report during his \nAugust 2018 PSI, Applicant indicated he was unaware of the debts. Ignorance of his debts \nhas negative implications for his financial responsibility, but it is a credible defense to \nintentional omission. The evidence falls short of establishing a knowing and willful \nfalsification of his SF 86. \nTwo of the seven potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are relevant in \nthis case. They are: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nThe passage of time weighs in Applicant\u2019s favor under AG \u00b6 17(c). Even so, his \ndrunk-driving and his use of cocaine in disregard of his clearance obligations, are all the \nmore serious because of their recidivism. AG \u00b6 17(d) has some applicability because \nApplicant received substance-abuse treatment after his August 2015 DUI and removed \nhimself in November 2015 from the bar environment where cocaine was accessible to \nhim. However, doubts persist for his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in some \naspects. He believes that his alcohol and cocaine use were secondary problems to his \nmental-health issues, which while it may be accurate, it shows he does not fully \nacknowledge the problematic nature of his alcohol and drug abuse on their own. \nMoreover, I am concerned about whether Applicant has been fully candid about \nthe extent of his alcohol problem, cocaine use, and even his treatment efforts. In addition \nto downplaying the seriousness of his drinking in 2019, he initially gave the impression \nthat he was currently seeing a private therapist (\u201cI\u2019ll go for a couple of months [and] stop \nfor a couple of months.\u201d Tr. 51), but then admitted that he had not seen a therapist for \nover a year. His therapeutic relationship with the clinician has apparently ended, as he is \nsearching to find another therapist. As for his cocaine use, he told the OPM investigator \nthat he used the drug three to five times for experimentation. He claimed he was alone \nwhen using the drug. Yet, at his hearing, he testified that he was introduced to cocaine at \nthe bar when he was drinking. He described his use of cocaine as intermittent. (Tr. 44.) \nHis VA records from 2015 and 2016, which were received after his hearing, indicate that \nhe was reported to have had his cocaine dealer on retainer, which suggests that he may \nhave been more involved with cocaine than a handful of uses. His reform is undermined \nto the extent that he minimizes his past involvement. The personal conduct security \nconcerns are not fully mitigated. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n22 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . .   \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Other than the car-loan deficiency in SOR \u00b6 5.a, \nApplicant did not recognize the debts on his credit report when questioned about them \nduring his August 2018 PSI. The Appeal Board has held that adverse information from a \ncredit report can normally meet the substantial evidence standard. See ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The inclusion of all of the SOR debts on one or more of the credit \nreports in evidence is sufficient to establish the delinquencies. Applicant did not dispute \nthe delinquencies when he responded to the SOR, although he asserted in January 2021 \nwhen he responded to interrogatories that half of the debts had been paid. Apparently, \nhis wages were garnished for the debt in SOR \u00b6 5.a starting in March 2018. It may be that \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 5.a was resolved through involuntary garnishment before the SOR was \nissued. Even so, the federal government is still entitled to consider the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring the debt and failing to \nsatisfy it in a timely manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. July 1, \n2015). His record of delinquency establishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial delinquencies.\u201d \nApplicant bears the burden of mitigating the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his proven delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nThe following are relevant to the issues in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n23 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, even though the SOR debts were not incurred \nrecently. Even assuming that his largest debt was resolved by garnishment of his wages \nbetween March 2018 and 2021, Applicant acknowledged that he was not proactive about \ninvestigating and resolving the delinquencies on his credit record. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n5.b through 5.j were brought to his attention during his August 2018 PSI. He testified that \non receipt of the SOR, he realized that he could not put off dealing with his delinquencies \nany longer. An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand are considered recent. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. July 31, 2018), citing, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017). \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant failed to provide any evidence to substantiate his \nclaim that a significant portion of his income went to pay medical debts. He was \nunemployed from November 2015 to June 2016, while participating in treatment programs \nfor his diagnosed PTSD and alcohol use disorder. While the circumstance that led to his \nunemployment was within his control, the loss of income caused some financial strain. \nYet, AG \u00b6 20(b) requires for mitigation that an individual act responsibly under his or her \ncircumstances. A component of financial responsibility is whether Applicant maintained \ncontact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts \ncurrent or payment plans for resolution of debt balances. There is no evidence that he did \nso. Some of the SOR accounts became delinquent while he was working for his current \nemployer. AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited applicability. \nApplicant has repeatedly maintained that the car-loan debt in SOR \u00b6 5.a has been \nfully satisfied. He provided no proof of the garnishment or of any other payment attempts \non the debt, although it no longer appears on his credit record. Resolution of the debt \nthrough garnishment would warrant some consideration of AG \u00b6 20(c) in that the debt \nwould no longer be a source of undue financial pressure for him. However, resolution \n24 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthrough garnishment diminishes the mitigating weight of that evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016). Applicant has not had any financial \ncounseling, which is required for full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c), even though he \nacknowledges that he could benefit from courses on financial management. \nApplicant asserts that he \u201cjust paid\u201d the $185 utility-services debt in SOR \u00b6 5.c; \nthat the other utility debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 5.d and 5.f have been resolved because he currently \nhas an account with the utility company that placed the debts for collection; that the \ninsurance debts, including the debt in SOR \u00b6 5.e, have been paid; that the $53 debt in \nSOR \u00b6 5.i likely has been paid because of its small amount; and that the credit-card debt \nin SOR \u00b6 5.k has been satisfied. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 5.e, 5.i, and 5.k appear on his July \n2022 credit report as outstanding delinquencies. The other debts had been dropped from \nhis credit report, but he provided no documentation showing they have been satisfied. \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201cwhen an applicant claims to have resolved a debt, he or \nshe is expected to present documentary evidence supporting the claim.\u201d See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nApplicant is not required to show that he has paid off each debt in the SOR, or that \nthe debts in the SOR be paid first. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 5, 2006). Yet the Appeal Board has also held that an applicant must demonstrate \n\u201ca plan for debt payment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that \nevidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d See ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2018)). \nApplicant admits that he has not addressed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 5.b, 5.g, and 5.h. He \nappears to have confused the debt in SOR \u00b6 5.j with a credit-card account that was paid \noff in 2021, but there is no evidence that he took any steps to check whether his \nunderstanding was correct. Consequently, a $3,923 balance has been in collections since \n2018. Applicant has no payment plans in place for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 5.b, 5.g, 5.h, or \n5.j. While their outstanding balances, which total $6,608, are manageable on his present \nincome, a promise to pay a debt at some future date is not a substitute for a track record \nof timely debt payments or otherwise financially responsible behavior. See ISCR Case \nNo, 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 2008). Applicant has not made enough progress toward \nresolving his old delinquencies to apply AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d). The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof Applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n25 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe analyses under Guidelines G, J, H, E, and F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is commended for his service in the ARNG, which included combat duty \nthat was a factor in him developing PTSD. He deserves considerable credit for seeking \nsubstance-abuse treatment in December 2019. His recognition that he needed help to \nstop drinking reflects that his previous treatment was of some benefit, despite his serious \nrelapse. However, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility, there is strong presumption against the grant or renewal of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). \nApplicant exercised very poor judgment in several different aspects. Based on the \nevidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. This decision \nshould not be construed as a determination that he cannot in the future attain the reform \nnecessary to establish his security worthiness, but persuasive evidence of his security \nworthiness is lacking at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 5, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n26 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_____________________ \nSubparagraphs 5.a-5.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nElizabeth M.

On June 24, 2021, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) consisting of a statement of the Government\u2019s position and five documents pre-\nmarked as Items 1 through 5. On July 6, 2021, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to \nApplicant and instructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant received the FORM on July 13, 2021. On August 16, 2021, Applicant submitted a \nresponse to the FORM. He included five attachments which I have identified as Items 6 \nthrough 10. The Government did not object, and on October 6, 2021, the case was \nassigned to me. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 60-year-old, single man. In 2015, he earned an associate degree in \nengineering. (Item 2 at 12) Since 2015, he has worked for a defense contractor as an \nelectrician. (Item 2 at 15) \nIn 2013, Applicant matriculated to college to earn an associate degree. He opened \nsix student-loan accounts, as set forth in subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d, and 1.f through \n1.h to finance the education. (Item 1 at 3) By the time Applicant graduated in 2015, he had \nincurred approximately $40,000 of student-loan debt. (Item 1 at 3) In early 2019, Applicant \nmissed a loan payment. (Item 1 at 3) The lender then contacted Applicant, offering to \narrange a weekly, wage garnishment. Applicant accepted the offer. Between April 2019 \nand February 2021, he made payments ranging from $148 and $250. (Item 8) In March \n2021, Applicant opted to end the garnishment payments and entered the federal \ngovernment\u2019s loan rehabilitation program. Under this plan, his wages are no longer \ngarnished and he now pays $561 per month. (Item 7) He has been paying without \ninterruption since he entered this plan.

(Item 8 at 2) \nSubparagraph 1.a, totaling $14,263 is a debt owed to a department store. In May \n2020, Applicant contacted the creditor and negotiated an agreement whereupon he agreed \nto satisfy it through 11 monthly payments of $406 in full and final settlement.

Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance,\nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative\njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder AG \u00b6 18, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant did not \nraise any issues with circumstances beyond his control contributing to his delinquencies. \nConsequently, the mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, \na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply. \nApproximately three years ago, Applicant began contacting his creditors and \nnegotiating payment plans. He has been successfully executing the payment plans, as he \nhas satisfied all of his non-student-loan debt entirely, and has been making payments on \nhis student loans since April 2019. The student loans are no longer in delinquent status. \nUnder these circumstances, the following mitigating conditions are applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIn sum, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that \nguideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nThe length of time that Applicant has been satisfying his student loans, together with \nthe absence of any other delinquent debt makes it unlikely that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will recur. Under these circumstances, the security concerns have been \nmitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017. \nOn July 16, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.

He has been employed with the DOD contractor for 17 years. This is his first \ntime applying for a security clearance. He was asked by his employer to submit a \nsecurity clearance application so he can work on classified projects. His highest level of \neducation is a Master\u2019s Degree. He is in a long-term relationship. He and his significant \nother live with their son, age 20 months. (Tr.16-19; Gov 1) (Note: The facts in this \ndecision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or locations in \norder to protect Applicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more \nspecific information.) \nUnder the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from January 1999 to at least January 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1, \nSection 23 at 30) The SOR also alleges Applicant intends to use marijuana in the future. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 1, Section 23 at 30). In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a but \u201c. . . with amplifying evidence of mitigating conditions \nhaving been met in the attached written reply, with exhibits. He denies SOR \u00b6 1.b again \nstating he has \u201camplifying evidence of mitigating conditions having been met.\u201d \n(Response to SOR) \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed his past marijuana use to the Government during \nhis security clearance background investigation. On his security clearance application, \ndated March 27, 2020, Applicant indicated that he used marijuana in response to \nSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. He estimated that he used marijuana \nfrom January 1999 to January 2020. He listed the nature and frequency of the \nmarijuana use as \u201cRecreational, perhaps less than 10 times per year.\u201d (Gov 1. Section \n23 at 30) \nDuring the hearing Applicant testified that he started using marijuana in college. \nHis use was more frequent during his college years. After college, his marijuana use \nwas not as frequent. Years would pass where he did not use marijuana. He used \nmarijuana in group settings where marijuana was offered to him. He never purchased \nmarijuana. He testified that he listed that he used marijuana \u201cperhaps less than 10 \ntimes per year\u201d in order to cover all of the instances of his marijuana use. He did not \nwant to be accused of under-reporting his marijuana use. In the summary of his \nbackground investigation interview, the investigator states that, \u201cSubject confirmed that \nhe smoked ten times per year from 1999 to January 2020, which he described as \ninfrequent.\u201d This summary of the background investigation interview was prepared by \nthe interviewer. (Gov 2) Applicant did not have an opportunity to review the statement \nfor accuracy. He did not have the opportunity to swear that the statement is an accurate \nrepresentation of what occurred during the interview. Instead, it is an unsworn summary \nof what the investigator claims transpired during the interview. Paragraph E3.1.17 of the \nDirective states DOD personnel background reports of investigation cannot be received \nwithout an authenticating witness. While Applicant did not object to Gov 2, I give Gov 2 \nless weight because it is unsworn and unauthenticated. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn his March 2020 security clearance application, Applicant wrote the following \nresponse to the question about his intentional future use of marijuana: \u201cRecreational \nmarijuana, as desired, with similar frequency as noted above, if at all.\u201d Applicant \ntestified that what he meant by this answer is that he may possibly use it in the future for \nexample, should marijuana become legal in the future. (Gov 1, section 23 at 30) The \nunsworn summary of Applicant\u2019s background investigation interview mentioned that \nwhen asked about his plans for future use of marijuana, Applicant said it was possible, \nmaybe. The investigator asked him about future use if it affected his security clearance \nas well as it being illegal under state and federal law. Applicant replied that he has no \nproblem with not using marijuana. His past marijuana use had no negative affect on his \npersonal and professional life. \nApplicant testified his last use of marijuana was over the July 4th  weekend in \n2019. He and his wife were out of town visiting friends. Someone passed around a \nmarijuana joint during a gathering and Applicant used it. Prior to that, he recalls his last \nuse of marijuana was in December 2016. He did not use for a period of years before \n2016. He estimated he used marijuana perhaps in 2010 or 2012. (Tr. 32, 39) On his \nMarch 2020, security clearance application, Applicant estimated his last use of \nmarijuana was in January 2020. Applicant testified he does not recall using in January \n2020, but the answers on his security clearance application may be more reliable than \nhis present memory. This was his first time completing a security clearance application \nand he was providing an estimate. He was trying to be as truthful as possible. (Tr. 34 -\n37)  \nApplicant testified that during his subsequent background investigation interview, \nthe interviewer did not ask about specific dates. The investigator wrote in his unsworn \nsummary of the interview: \u201cSubject confirmed that he has smoked marijuana about ten \ntimes per year from 1999 to January 2020, which he described as infrequent.\u201d (Gov 2) \nApplicant testified: \u201cThat was his interpretation from our phone conversation. So he \ntranscribed that. I did not make that exact statement.\u201d (Tr.47) \nUnder cross-\nexamination, Department Counsel mentioned that Applicant was providing a different \nanswer. Applicant replied: \nOkay, I cannot - - I would say that I cannot recall the exact statement that I \nwould have made vocally to him on the phone, and the only evidence to \nrefer back to that is what he put on there. But I do not necessarily agree \nwith the that exact vernacular that\u2019s used in that statement, and that is \nsomething that I could clarify. So had I had \u2013 had I read this - - And by the \nway, also this occurred before I sought any counsel. I didn\u2019t really \nunderstand what - - about the whole process there, but had I read this and \nhad the opportunity to have follow-up conversation with this interviewer, I \nwould have enjoyed the opportunity to clarify some of these statements.  \n(Tr. 47)  \nOn April 2, 2021, Applicant signed a Statement of Intent declaring that he will not \nillegally use any drugs, to include marijuana in the future. He acknowledged that any \nfuture use of illegal drugs shall constitute grounds for revocation of his security \nclearance.

The appointment lasted one hour. Applicant told Dr. J.C. that he first used \nmarijuana in college in 1999. Some years he did not use at all, other years he used less \nthan 10 times a year. He reported his use decreased over time since college, and was \nalways sporadic. He only used in social situations when it was offered to him. He never \npurchased marijuana. He denied his marijuana usage created legal, health, social, \nemployment or financial issues. He denies cravings, withdrawal symptoms, or tolerance \nrelated to marijuana use. He has never used marijuana at work or before work and has \nnever been under the influence of marijuana at work. He denies significant alcohol use. \nHe drinks socially and has on average 1-2 glasses of wine a week. He mentioned his \nnewborn son has health problems. As a result, he has no desire to engage in substance \nabuse and is focused on healthy lifestyle changes. He denies ever being treated for \nsubstance abuse. (AE E at 2-3) \nDr. J.C. concludes that based on Applicant\u2019s reported history of cannabis use, he \ndoes not meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder. She notes he \nreported not using cannabis since late 2019 and has no plans to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He is focused on a healthy lifestyle, caring for his family and newborn and \nprogressing in his career. She recommends no further treatment because he shows no \ncurrent or history of clinically significant distress or social/occupational/financial/health \nimpairment related to cannabis use or other substance use. (AE E at 3) \nOn May 3, 2021, and August 5, 2022, Applicant submitted samples of his urine to \ntest for illegal drugs, to include marijuana. Both samples tested negative.

She describes \nApplicant as \u201cexceptionally well-reasoned, responsible, and trustworthy.\u201d They recently \npurchased a home. When their son was born five weeks early in December 2020, \nApplicant advocated for their son when he was in the hospital. He fed and cared for \ntheir son when he was so small that he could hold him in the palm of his hand. She \nmoved in with Applicant in January 2020. The last time she recalls seeing Applicant use \nmarijuana was at a party over the 4th  of July weekend in 2019. She states Applicant \nwants to remove himself entirely from situations where people may be using illegal \nsubstances or drinking alcohol heavily. Applicant\u2019s resolve has only strengthened since \nthe birth of their son. He is dedicated to being an exceptional role model for their son \nand she is confident that he will not use marijuana in the future. (AE D at 11-13).

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana.  \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production \nand distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive \nposition are prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, \nbut not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \n\u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case.  \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue illegal drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such misuse. \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits he used marijuana on various occasions \nfrom 1999 to January 2020. He used marijuana on a regular basis during college. His \nmarijuana use tapered off upon his graduation from college when Applicant began to \nfocus on his career. There were periods of years where he did not use marijuana. \nApplicant admits to using marijuana sporadically over the years after college. During the \nhearing, he recalled his last use being on July 4, 2019. He indicated on his security \nclearance application that his last use was in January 2020. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nApplicant did not cultivate, purchase, or distribute marijuana. He did possess marijuana \nwhen he used the marijuana. Based on this reason, AG \u00b6 25(c) applies. \nI find AG \u00b6 25(g) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s response on his security \nclearance application regarding future marijuana use did not expressly state that he \nintended to use marijuana in the future.  His answer appeared to be more of a guess. \n\u201cRecreational marijuana, as desired with similar frequency as noted above, if at all.\u201d It is \nnot a strong enough statement to verify that Applicant had definite intent to use \nmarijuana in the future. The phrase, \u201c. . . if at all\u201d, makes it seem unlikely that he would \nuse marijuana in the future.  His testimony during the hearing reinforced this notion.   \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions apply to the \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred close to \nthree years ago. Applicant disclosed his last marijuana use on his March 2020 security \nclearance application as January 2020. He put the word \u201cestimated\u201d in parentheses. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s answers about his last of use of marijuana varied in responses on \nhis security clearance application and testimony at hearing, I find the various \ndiscrepancies to be minimal. It is important to note that Applicant clearly indicated that \nthese dates were estimates. He chose to provide a broad overview of his marijuana use \nbecause he did not want the government to think he was lying about his marijuana use. \nI find Applicant was honest and forthright about his past illegal marijuana use. While his \nillegal marijuana use showed extremely poor judgment, Applicant\u2019s circumstances have \nchanged a lot over the past few years. He and his significant other became parents and \npurchased a house. Applicant\u2019s current focus is on his family and career. This is his \nfirst time applying for a security clearance. During the process, which he found \nconfusing, Applicant learned that marijuana use is not consistent with holding a security \nclearance. It is unlikely he will use marijuana in the future. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies. Applicant recalled at hearing his last use of marijuana was in \nJuly 2019. Since that time, his priorities have changed. He became a father. He and his \nsignificant other are focused on staying healthy for their son. He avoids social situations \nwhere people are using marijuana. Applicant provided a signed statement of intent to \nrefrain from all illegal drug involvement and substance misuse indicating that any \nviolation could result in the revocation of his security clearance. Applicant was \nforthcoming about his marijuana use on his security clearance application and during \nthe hearing. He demonstrated an appropriate period of abstinence. While Applicant \nused marijuana over a period of 20 years, he was never a habitual marijuana user, only \nusing when it was offered to him at parties. His use was highest during college. There \nwere years where Applicant did not use marijuana. Dr. J.C.\u2019s substance abuse \nevaluation indicates Applicant\u2019s history of past marijuana use raised no significant \nissues and recommended no further treatment. \nApplicant met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThere are reasons that support not granting a security clearance to Applicant. \nQuestions are raised about Applicant\u2019s judgment because of his admitted illegal use of \nmarijuana over a 20-year-period. I find the mitigating reasons outweigh the disqualifying \nreasons in Applicant\u2019s case. He disclosed his marijuana use on his security clearance \napplication, which supports that he is trustworthy. He stopped using marijuana in either \nJuly 2019 or January 2020 and has not used marijuana for close to three years. He \nsigned a statement of intent to refrain from all drug involvement and substance misuse \nand acknowledged that any future substance misuse could result in the revocation of his \nsecurity clearance. Applicant has built a successful career and is highly regarded \namong his peers. His current priorities are focused on his family, staying healthy, and \nproviding a good example to his young son. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has learned a significant \nlesson. While his marijuana use showed poor judgment, he disclosed his marijuana use \nduring the security clearance process. He learned from his mistake in judgment and \ntook steps to demonstrate his intent to refrain from illegal marijuana use. Applicant is \naware that should he illegally use marijuana in the future, it is likely that his security \nclearance will be revoked. Concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use are \nmitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

It also calls into question his ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 2007 to 2012. He separated at the rank \nof E-4, petty officer, third class, and received an honorable discharge. Applicant held a \nsecurity clearance in the military without incident. Applicant began consuming alcohol \nwhen he joined the Navy. He started by consuming a couple of beers at social events. \nAs time passed, he found himself drinking as much as ten beers at a time to the point of \nintoxication. (Government Exhibit 2.)  \nIn 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence \n(DUI.) \nApplicant explained that he was with a close friend, at a bar drinking alcohol. \nBefore driving back to his parent\u2019s house, Applicant believes he consumed at least five \nbeers and two shots of hard liquor. (Tr. pp. 23-24.) While driving, Applicant hit another \ncar. When the police arrived, Applicant was administered the breathalyzer, and found \nto be legally intoxicated. Applicant was arrested and taken into custody. Applicant pled \nnolo contendere to the DUI charge. He was found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine \nand referred to driver\u2019s education classes and alcohol counseling. His license was \nrevoked for one year, and he was required to attend a substance abuse rehabilitation \nprogram. \nApplicant was also required to pay restitution for the damage from the \naccident. Applicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. Since Applicant \nwas active duty Navy at the time of the arrest, he was reduced in rank from E-4 to E-3, \nplaced on one month\u2019s restriction on the ship, and forfeited to half a month\u2019s pay for two \nmonths. (Tr. p. 29, and Government Exhibit 4.) Following this arrest, Applicant states \nthat he was able to maintain sobriety for about nine months. (Tr. p. 31.)

Applicant explained that \nhe was at his cousin\u2019s house, talking, drinking, and playing cards. Applicant believes \nthat he had consumed only one beer before driving home. (Tr. p. 32.) Applicant was \npulled over by the police, and administered the breathalyzer. Applicant believes that he \npassed the sobriety tests, as he was not arrested. He was given a Reckless Driving \ncitation, and required to appear in court. (Tr. p. 33.) Applicant was sentenced to pay a \nfine, required to enroll in and complete a driver improvement course, and required to \nremain arrest and conviction free for a period of six months. After receiving this ticket, \nApplicant stopped drinking altogether for about six months. (Tr. p. 36 and Government \nExhibit 5.) \nIn 2015, Applicant was arrested again for DUI. Applicant stated that he and a \nclose friend were hanging out. They went drinking at a bar, and then took a taxi back to \nhis friend\u2019s place to sleep. Applicant believes that he had consumed, \u201cunder ten beers\u201d \nbefore the arrest. (Tr. p. 37.) Applicant spent the night at his friend\u2019s house, and the \nnext afternoon at about 2:00 pm, he drove home. Applicant fell asleep at the stop light, \nand when he woke up, he continued driving. He was pulled over by law enforcement. \nApplicant was administered the breathalyzer, and taken into custody. Applicant\u2019s court \ncase was eventually dismissed on a technicality, as the officer did not appear. (Tr. pp. \n40-41, and Government Exhibits 6 and 7.) \nFollowing this arrest, Applicant was able to remain totally sober for about nine \nmonths. (Tr. p. 42.) Applicant stated that during this time he would stay away from his \nfriends. In 2016, he started drinking alcohol again at social events. \nIn 2019, Applicant was arrested for DUI again. Applicant stated that he was \ndrinking with a friend. Applicant consumed at least five beers and two shots of hard \nliquor, and then decided to drive home. On this occasion, Applicant \u201crear-ended\u201d a bus \nand then reversed the car, and hit a police car. \nApplicant was administered the \nbreathalyzer that registered a .16 blood alcohol level, which was twice the legal limit. \nApplicant was arrested and taken into custody. Applicant plead nolo contendere. He \nwas found guilty, and sentenced to a driver\u2019s education classes, his license was \nrevoked for one year, and he was required to attend a substance abuse assessment \nand rehabilitation program. (Government Exhibit 8.) \nFollowing this arrest, Applicant stopped drinking for a couple of months. When \nhe started drinking again, he states that he would only have a beer here and there. \nApplicant completed all of the court ordered sentencing requirements related to his four \nalcohol-related arrests. He states that he no longer drinks and drives. Applicant states \nthat he is a good employee and a hard worker on the job. He is the first one in his \nfamily to be able to purchase a house, and he is proud of this. He has picked up \ngardening as a hobby.  (Tr. p. 50.)

Applicant states that \nthe last time he consumed alcohol was a few months ago and it was a beer.  (Tr. p. 54.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual was diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nConcerning his history of alcohol abuse, the evidence shows that Applicant \nincurred at least four arrests, three charges for DUI, resulting in two convictions for DUI, \nand one for Reckless Driving. These incidents raise serious security concerns under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant failed to introduce sufficient evidence of rehabilitation. Applicant is an \nalcoholic with a long pattern of abusive drinking. Applicant began abusing alcohol in \n2010 while in the military, and he continues to consume alcohol. Since his first DUI, his \nexcessive drinking has caused him many encounters with law enforcement. \nFurthermore, although he has not been formally diagnosed as being an alcoholic, he \nacknowledges that he is one. He has had four alcohol-related arrests away from work, \nthe most recent one occurred as recently as 2019. Following each arrest, Applicant has \ntried to quit drinking. Each time, he abstained from alcohol for a period before returning \nto his regular drinking pattern. Applicant states that his goal is to quit drinking, but he is \nnot there yet. It is noted that Applicant has successfully completed all of the court-\nordered sentencing requirements. He has attended the alcohol awareness programs, \npaid the fines, paid restitution, attended AA meetings, and completed his probation, but \nhe continues to consume alcohol. \nUnder the circumstances, Applicant has not \ndemonstrated sufficient good judgment and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. \u00b6 23 does not provide mitigation. \nGuideline J:  Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted \nor convicted. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Neither of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record spans over a period of twelve years, beginning in \n2010 and continuing to 2014, 2015 and most recently 2019, which is less than three \nyears ago. This history reflects four alcohol-related arrests; which include three arrests \nfor DUI, resulting in two DUI convictions, and one arrest for Reckless Driving. Applicant \nacknowledges that he is an alcoholic, but continues to consume alcohol. Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct demonstrates poor judgment, immaturity and a total disregard for the \nlaw. This is inexcusable. Applicant has not established that he is sufficiently reliable \nand trustworthy to access classified information. \nHis criminal conduct involves \nexcessive alcohol abuse and gives rise to serious concerns about his judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because of the nature of the offenses, and the \ncircumstances surrounding the offenses.  The before-mentioned disqualifying conditions \nhave been established and are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and analysis \nset forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that \nhe meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the sole allegation in the SOR, with explanations. Her admission is incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old information security analyst employed by defense contractors since August 2016. She has worked for her current employer since December 2021. (Tr. 30.) She served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from July 2006 to May 2013. She received a security clearance in January 2007 and eligibility for access to SCI in June 2012. She has been attending a community college since 2018. She has an associate\u2019s degree and is working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 29.) As of the date of the hearing, she continued to hold a clearance and SCI eligibility. (Tr. 6.) The SOR alleges a mortgage loan, reflected in a December 2019 credit report, that is past due for $140,708 and is in foreclosure status with a balance of $410,901. (GX 4.) As of the date of the SOR, the loan was still delinquent. In response to interrogatories from the DOD CAF (the predecessor of DSCA CAF) in March 2020, Applicant stated that she and her then fianc\u00e9 purchased the home in 2010, using her veteran\u2019s benefits. Her fianc\u00e9 was the primary borrower on the loan, and she was a co-borrower. Applicant and her fianc\u00e9 were both on active duty in the Navy when they became engaged in 2010 and Applicant became pregnant. Her fianc\u00e9 left active duty in October 2010.

The DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 30, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

On September 19, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted \nby video teleconference on October 25, 2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1-3 and 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. GX 4, \nan unauthenticated summary of a personal subject interview of Applicant on August 24, \n2018, was not admitted. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other \nwitnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until November \n29, 2022, to enable her to submit documentary evidence. She timely submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through P. Because parts of the cover letter for AX A through \nP are testimonial, I have marked it as AX Q. Her exhibits were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the sole allegation in the SOR, \nwith explanations. Her admission is incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old information security analyst employed by defense \ncontractors since August 2016. She has worked for her current employer since December \n2021. (Tr. 30.) She served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from July 2006 to May 2013. \nShe received a security clearance in January 2007 and eligibility for access to SCI in June \n2012. She has been attending a community college since 2018. She has an associate\u2019s \ndegree and is working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 29.) As of the date of the hearing, \nshe continued to hold a clearance and SCI eligibility. (Tr. 6.) \nThe SOR alleges a mortgage loan, reflected in a December 2019 credit report, that \nis past due for $140,708 and is in foreclosure status with a balance of $410,901. (GX 4.) \nAs of the date of the SOR, the loan was still delinquent. \nIn response to interrogatories from the DOD CAF (the predecessor of DSCA CAF) \nin March 2020, Applicant stated that she and her then fianc\u00e9 purchased the home in 2010, \nusing her veteran\u2019s benefits. Her fianc\u00e9 was the primary borrower on the loan, and she \nwas a co-borrower. \nApplicant and her fianc\u00e9 were both on active duty in the Navy when they became \nengaged in 2010 and Applicant became pregnant. Her fianc\u00e9 left active duty in October \n2010. Applicant was involved in a serious automobile accident with a drunk driver in \nNovember 2010 that caused her to lose her unborn child and suffer serious injuries that \ncaused her to be medically retired in May 2013. (Tr. 21.) She has a 90% disability for \nwhich she receives disability pay of $1,998 per month. (Tr. 36.) Her fianc\u00e9 stopping \nworking at his civilian job to care for her. She received a settlement of $142,000 from the \ndrunk driver. At some point, her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 deteriorated, causing her to \nmove out of the home in October 2013. (GX 3 at 6.) She testified that she stopped making \npayments on the loan in December 2013.

She was unemployed from May to \nAugust 2016, when she was hired by a federal contractor. \nThe last activity on the loan was in July 2013, and the lender has initiated \nforeclosure. (GX 4 at 1.) Applicant testified that she orally contacted the lender about a \nhardship loan modification before she moved out of the home in 2013, but the lender did \nnot respond. (Tr. 57-58.) She was not aware that the loan payments were past due until \nshe received a letter from the lender in 2015. (Tr. 22.) She consulted with an attorney \nabout filing a partition action, but the lawyer advised her that it would cost at least $10,000 \nand would not resolve the delinquent loan. (Tr. 24.) \nIn October 2016, Applicant agreed to give her former fianc\u00e9 a quitclaim deed if the \nbank would agree to take her off the loan. (AX B.) She signed a quitclaim deed in \nNovember 2016 to enable her former fianc\u00e9 to refinance the loan. (GX 5 at 1; AX C.) \nHowever, he did not submit the documents for a refinancing. (AX D.) He continues to live \nin the home. Applicant no longer is a co-owner, but she is still the co-borrower on the \nloan. \nApplicant met with a counselor from the local Urban League office in October 2013. \n(AX A.) She consulted with several lawyers in January 2018, February 2019, and March \n2020, but did not hire any of them because of the expense. (AX E, F, G, and H.) In \nFebruary 2019, she contacted the lawyer referral service for her area, who referred her \nto a lawyer. She had not met with this lawyer as of the date the record closed. (AX O; AX \nP.) She contacted the original lender and asked what options were available to resolve \nthe delinquent loan. Her letter to the lender is undated, but it lists her most recent address. \n(AX I.) \nApplicant currently earns $140,000 per year. Her monthly take-home pay is about \n$7,500. Her monthly disability pay is $1,998. (Tr. 44.) She purchased a home in June \n2021, and her monthly payment on the mortgage loan is $2,640. She is making monthly \ncar payments totaling about $2,000 for two late-model luxury cars. She estimates that her \ntotal monthly expenses are about $5,000. (Tr. 44-47.) She also owns a timeshare property \nthat she purchased in 2018. Her monthly payment for this property is about $264. (Tr. \n48.) She carries a balance of about $36,000 on her credit cards. (Tr. 50.) A November \n2022 credit report reflects no delinquent debts. (AX J.) \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor describes her as a valuable, responsible, and \nattentive member of the team. He vouches for her work ethic, integrity, and honesty. (AX \nK.) A co-worker for the past two years considers her honest, patient, hardworking, \nfocused, and ethical. (AX L.)

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(b) are not established. Applicant has a good income, sufficient \nto purchase a home, a timeshare property, and two luxury cars. Her most recent credit \nreport reflects that she is current on all her financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 19(c) is established. Applicant appears to have sufficient income to resolve \nthe delinquent mortgage loan, but she has not made payments on the loan for many \nyears, and she has not yet reached an agreement on resolving the delinquent loan. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. The debt is recent, but it is infrequent, and it arose under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant and her ex-fianc\u00e9 purchased a home for \nthemselves and their unborn child. Her near-fatal car crash and the loss of their unborn \nchild apparently did not impair their relationship, because her ex-fianc\u00e9 continued to care \nfor her while she recovered from her injuries. Although Applicant was vague about the \nreasons for their breakup, it appears to have been a condition largely beyond her control. \nHer ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s financial irresponsibility after the breakup was a condition beyond her \ncontrol. She was duped into giving her ex-fianc\u00e9 a quitclaim deed for the property. The \nlender has not proceeded with foreclosure, which would significantly reduce the amount \nof indebtedness, even though the loan has been delinquent for many years. Applicant \nacted responsibly by seeking legal advice, contacting the lender on multiple occasions, \nand exploring options for resolving the debt. (AX I.) Her recent letter to the lender is \nundated, but it lists her most recent address. The lender has not responded. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not established. Applicant has not received \nfinancial counseling, and the problem is not being resolved. She has not made any \npayments on the delinquent loan, and she has not disputed the legitimacy of the debt. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. She is \nfinancially stable. She has earned the respect of her supervisors and coworkers. She \nserved honorably in the U.S. Navy. She has held a security clearance and SCI eligibility \nfor many years. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline \nF, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by the delinquent mortgage loan. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicants eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant has been sponsored for employment as a software engineer by a defense contractor since October 2019 (Item 4). She is a 56-year-old software engineer who was not employed from May 2018 to October 2019, when she experimented with retirement as she simultaneously helped care for her ailing, elderly mother. She had been employed as a software engineer in the private sector between December 1999 and March 2014, when she was subject to a reduction in force, and between June 2015 and May 2018, when she decided to try retirement. She has never been married and has no children. She served in the U.S. military reserve from March 1985 to September 1990, when she was honorably discharged. She has not previously held an industrial clearance, but had a previous background investigation during her time in the military. The SOR alleges, Items 3-7 substantiate, and Applicant admits, four delinquent debts totaling over $20,000 (SOR 1.a-1.c and 1.h). The Government withdrew SOR debts 1.d-1.g (FORM). The debts comprise $20,000 in delinquent medical bills and a $500 commercial credit account. The medical bills appear to have originated with an unalleged $28,000 judgment obtained in December 2016 (Item 7). Applicant reported several financial issues on her October 2019 clearance application (Item 3), including the debts encompassed at SOR 1.a-1.c, two medical bills later withdrawn by the Government (SOR 1.d and 1.g), and 1.h.

She is a 56-year-old software engineer \nwho was not employed from May 2018 to October 2019, when she experimented with \nretirement as she simultaneously helped care for her ailing, elderly mother. She had been \nemployed as a software engineer in the private sector between December 1999 and \nMarch 2014, when she was subject to a reduction in force, and between June 2015 and \nMay 2018, when she decided to try retirement. She has never been married and has no \nchildren. She served in the U.S. military reserve from March 1985 to September 1990, \nwhen she was honorably discharged. She has not previously held an industrial clearance, \nbut had a previous background investigation during her time in the military. \nThe SOR alleges, Items 3-7 substantiate, and Applicant admits, four delinquent \ndebts totaling over $20,000 (SOR 1.a-1.c and 1.h). The Government withdrew SOR debts \n1.d-1.g (FORM). The debts comprise $20,000 in delinquent medical bills and a $500 \ncommercial credit account. The medical bills appear to have originated with an unalleged \n$28,000 judgment obtained in December 2016 (Item 7). \nApplicant reported several financial issues on her October 2019 clearance \napplication (Item 3), including the debts encompassed at SOR 1.a-1.c, two medical bills \nlater withdrawn by the Government (SOR 1.d and 1.g), and 1.h. She discussed these \ndebts, among others, during an interview with a Government investigator in December \n2019 (Item 4) based on her November 2019 credit report (Item 5). Among the other \ndelinquent accounts reflected on the November 2019 credit report were several \neducational loans that were later brought current and therefore not alleged in the SOR. \nShe claimed, without corroboration, to have been making $20 monthly payments on SOR \ndebt 1.h. She also claimed to have been making $500 monthly payments on the medical \njudgment until about May 2018, when she stopped working and began caring for her \nmother. She claimed, without corroboration, to have been making efforts to locate the \ncreditor holding the judgment, without success. \nApplicant attributed her medical debts to her March 2014 layoff. Initially provided \nwith extended medical coverage, she did not realize the steps she had to take to continue \nthe coverage, undertook additional medical treatment for a condition that her insurance \nhad previously covered, only to discover that her coverage has expired and the treatment \nwas not covered. Changes of address, miscommunications, and other problems kept her \nfrom learning that the debts had been reduced to judgment in December 2016. She began \nmaking payments with her then-current employer, but those payments stopped when she \nleft that job in May 2018. Her a\n dditional unemployment caused the balance to grow, and \nat the time of her clearance application, credit report, and subject interview, the combined \nbalances were just over $20,000. Applicant continued to have problems getting a current \ndebt figure. She ultimately provided a 17 May 2021 letter from the creditor confirming a \n$10,000 payment that day, and a remaining balance of $10,202.80 (Response).

However, the \ncreditor\u2019s letter does not confirm this plan, and Applicant has provided no corroboration \nof her past efforts to contact the creditor or to set up a payment plan. \nHer two unemployment periods adversely affected her finances beyond the SOR \nallegations, but Applicant provided documentation of her efforts to resolve those debts \nand they are not alleged in the SOR. However, she has not documented any credit or \nfinancial counseling. She did not provide a budget showing her ability to manage her \nclaimed repayment plan. She did not present any evidence from coworkers, character \nreferences, or community groups. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00a7 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Since at least 2016, Applicant has \nexperienced financial problems which left her unwilling or unable to pay her debts. 3 \n2See, Department of the Navy v.

The obvious improvement in the status of her \neducation loans which occurred outside the boundaries of the SOR evinces some interest \nin restoring her finances, but is insufficient to overcome the adverse impact of her ongoing \nindebtedness. \nFurther, Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. \nHer financial difficulties are many, are likely to recur, given that she was relying on the \nproffered employment for an increase in salary.4 Even if her financial problems were due \nto circumstances beyond her control, her lack of documentation of her claimed efforts to \nsatisfy her debts or to outline her plan for moving forward precludes a conclusion that she \nacted responsibly to address her debts.5 A similar analysis, including the lack of financial \nor credit counseling, or an articulated plan for addressing the debts, also precludes a \nconclusion that the debts are being resolved,6 and that that resolution was made in good \nfaith.7 \nThe Appeal Board has stated that an Applicant need not have paid every debt \nalleged in the SOR, need not pay the SOR debts first, and need not be paying on all debts \nsimultaneously. Applicant need only establish that there is a credible and realistic plan to \nresolve the financial problems, accompanied by significant actions to implement the plan.8 \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to date do not constitute such a plan, and she has not documented \nsignificant action to resolve her debts. She has not adequately addressed the security \nconcerns raised by her past financial issues. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1.

(Item 3 at 31-32; Item 4 at 3-4; Item 6 at 6.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed a total of approximately \n$24,000 on five past-due debts. Applicant\u2019s admissions in the Answer and the two credit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreports in the record establish these facts. Accordingly, the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions are applicable, and the burden of proof shifts to Applicant to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts arose under different \ncircumstances and at different times, including as recently as 2019 and 2020. \nApplicant has presented no evidence to show a change in his behavior. Additional \ndelinquencies are likely to recur. His behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) only partially applies. Three of his debts are the result of his \nunsuccessful work as an insurance agent, which arguably was a circumstance \nbeyond his control. He has not, however, acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He has made no effort to resolve those debts since 2016 and he \nhas in fact incurred two additional delinquent debts since then. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (c) and (d) have not been established. Applicant provided no \nevidence that he has received any financial counseling or that his delinquent debts \nare being resolved. Similarly, he has provided no evidence that he has made any \npayments to those creditors. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial considerations. He has not minimized the potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress. He has also not shown that there is little likelihood of \nrecurrence. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

These are cartoon \nimages and not real people. (Tr. 44-45; GE 3) \nIn May 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of a \nbackground investigation. During the interview, he told the investigator that he never \nintentionally searched for child pornography, however when visiting mainstream \npornography websites, there would be advertisements and videos that appeared to \ninclude child pornography. He told the investigator he did not watch any videos that \ncontained child pornography. He could not provide the dates or years he encountered \nthese videos. He said it was only two or three times that he encountered these kinds of \nvideos when he was on websites. He told the investigator that he had no motivation to \naccess child pornography and would only come across it accidentally. He told the \ninvestigator that he is now married and no longer visits pornography sites and it will not \nhappen in the future. (Tr. 45-50; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his statement to the investigator that minimized his \nbehavior as reported to the polygraph examiner was that he was not actively and \nconsistently looking for underage material. He claimed when he realized there was child \npornography on a site he would click it off. Applicant admitted that his statement to the \ninvestigator that he had not watched any videos that included child pornography was not \nthe full truth. He said he was unsure of the age of the female in the above-mentioned \nvideo and turned off the video. His testimony is not credible. He deliberately provided \nfalse statements to the government investigator. (Tr. 49-51) \nApplicant testified that he grew up in a sheltered family environment and attended \nchurch. He said he was asked during his polygraph about viewing pornography. He \ntestified that he spent most of his time visiting adult pornography sites and for a short \nperiod of time he viewed other sites. He would click on sites that he was unaware of what \ntypes of images they contained. He said it was not uncommon to see stuff he did not \nexpect. He testified that he did not intentionally search for sites with child pornography. \nHe explained that this period of his life is in his past and he has attempted to disassociate \nhimself with this lifestyle. (Tr. 20-23) \nApplicant testified that he believes the polygraph examiner inaccurately reported \nhis conduct. He stated that he felt he was telling the polygraph examiner the truth, but it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas being \u201cconflated.\u201d (Tr. 25) He admitted that he did not believe the polygraph examiner \nhad a personal bias against him. He testified that he was on the websites: \u201cAnime\u201d, \u201cHard \nCore\u201d, \u201cBeautiful Girls\u201d, and \u201cMotherless,\u201d and he told the polygraph examiner that he \nvisited pornography sites every other day. He believes now his frequency of viewing such \nsites was less than he said to the polygraph examiner. He disagreed with the polygraph \nexaminer\u2019s summary that stated he was viewing females between the ages of 14 and 18 \nevery other day. He explained he was viewing pornography every other day, but he was \nnot viewing females 14 to 18 years old. (Tr. 23-26, 30-31) \nApplicant stated that he had viewed 100 videos of Anime pornography, as was \nstated in the polygraph examiners summary of interview, and some may have included \nAnime children between 5 and 10 years old. He emphasized that he did not seek out \nviewing child images, but those he saw were not pornographic. He does not know where \nthe polygraph examiner got the statement he watched 100 pornography videos of Anime \ncartoon characters portraying children. (Tr. 31-38) \nApplicant also stated that he does not know where the polygraph examiner got the \nstatement that he viewed females whose ages were between 14 and 30 years old. He \nwas questioned by Department Counsel and made the following statements: \nDC: The next paragraph related to the Beautiful Girl image board and \nthat one says they contain images of females ranging from 14 to 30, \nis that an accurate statement? \nA: So, Beautiful Girl, I vaguely remember what Beautiful Girl is but \n14 to 30, I don\u2019t know. \nDC: So, where did the 14 to 30 come from? \nA: I think she asked me if I had ever seen someone that I wasn\u2019t sure \nof and if I could give an age range. I said she was younger, I don\u2019t \nknow, I\u2019m sure I gave an age of 14, that\u2019s what it says here.  \nDC: And the Beautiful Girl image board, is it primarily nude images, \nis that what that is? \nA: I would assume so, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not 100 percent sure.  \nDC: The next sentence says you masturbated to images of females \nas young as 14 years old, is that an accurate statement? \nA: I think I had seen something before where I wasn\u2019t sure of the age \nof and if I had to give an age, I gave the age of 14. Looking back on \nit, I don\u2019t know just because I just don\u2019t know. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDC: Is it a fair statement that if you estimated they were 14 years old, \nyou at least at a minimum believed they could have been as young \nas 14 when [you] were masturbating to them? \nA: I don\u2019t know. \nDC: You don\u2019t know. I think they might have been as young as 14, \nyou don\u2019t know whether you believed they were as young as 14? \nA: I think that more than likely I\u2019m putting myself in this situation \nwhere I\u2019m feeling bad about what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019m going into this \njust trying to offer an answer and I don\u2019t\u2019 know.  \nDC: But help me understand, your interview from the [government], \nyou\u2019re talking to a government official and you think it\u2019s I\u2019m not sure \nso I\u2019m going to estimate that I viewed and masturbated to child porn? \nA: There\u2019s one instance that I can think of, of a video, where I\u2019m \nwatching it and it\u2019s like somewhere through it I don\u2019t know how old \nthis person is. I had my hands down my pants or whatever and I \nclicked off of it. It\u2019s not this is something I was going to find and I don\u2019t \nknow the age. Because I don\u2019t know the age and this person is \nasking me how old do you think they were, I\u2019m saying, I don\u2019t know \nthey could be anywhere between this age and I gave an age. That \ndoesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what it is, I was trying to just produce and answer \nfor an occasion where I viewed something where I wasn\u2019t 100 \npercent sure of what the age of the person was. I felt like I had to \ngive an answer. (Tr. 38-40) \nApplicant also testified that he has no idea how the polygraph examiner came up \nwith the statement that less than 30 times he masturbated to images of females younger \nthan 14. When Applicant was asked by Department Counsel if he told the polygraph \nexaminer that he had masturbated to images of females under the age of 18, he testified \nhe did not know what he told the polygraph examiner. He repeated his admission of the \nincident noted above that he masturbated while watching a video of a female who had a \nyoung face. He then said he had no indication of her age and then clicked off the video. I \ndid not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 40-43, 58-60) \nIn Applicant\u2019s statement to the government investigator in May 2019, he stated he \ndid not watch any videos that included child pornography. He was questioned about his \nstatement to the polygraph examiner where he reported he had watched videos of \nfemales ages 14-18. He testified that he never intentionally or actively searched for child \npornography. He testified if child pornography accidentally appeared he would click it off. \nI did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. I find that he deliberately provided false facts \nto a government investigator during his May 2019 background interview by stating he \nnever searched for or viewed child pornography and only inadvertently came across child \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npornography on two or three occasions while searching mainstream pornography \nwebsites. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he no longer watches pornography. He testified that he last \nviewed pornography in the summer of 2018. He told the polygraph examiner that he \nstopped viewing pornography when he received a conditional letter of employment in \n2014. He testified that he was trying to stop watching pornography in 2012. He testified \nthat from 2012 to 2018, he decreased his pornography viewing habits. He said that he \nwanted to clarify and give a more accurate depiction of his pornographic viewing habits. \nHe said that he has made significant lifestyle changes and pulled away from viewing \npornography. (Tr. 52-54) \nApplicant testified that he believes his summary of interview by the polygraph \nexaminer was misinterpreted. He was under a lot of stress when he was being \ninterviewed. \nApplicant testified that he would not want anyone to find out about his past \naddiction to pornography and allegations of viewing child pornography. No one but his \nwife is aware of his past. He believes if others were aware it could harm his personal and \nprofessional relationships. (Tr. 61-62) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of sexual orientation of the \nindividual.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports that from approximately 2010 to 2014, at various times, \nApplicant viewed child pornography. The only one who is aware of Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nhis wife. He is concerned if others were aware it would hurt his personal and professional \nrelationships. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom sexual behavior. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no evidence \nof subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet, and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant repeatedly viewed child pornography at various times from 2010 to 2014. \nViewing child pornography is criminal conduct. It was not alleged under the criminal \nconduct guideline, and will not be considered under that guideline, but the underlying \nconduct cannot be mitigated because he viewed it privately or discreetly. It was cross-\nalleged under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant\u2019s behavior did not occur during \nadolescence. There is no evidence Applicant has completed an appropriate treatment \nprogram. Applicant stated that he did not intentionally access child pornography. The \nevidence supports that he repeatedly viewed it. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible. I believe he repeatedly provided false testimony. I am not convinced that future \nconduct is unlikely to recur or that Applicant grasps the seriousness of his conduct. His \nbehavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.  \nThe evidence supports that from 2010 to 2014, Applicant repeatedly viewed child \npornography. He disclosed his conduct during an interview with a polygraph examiner in \n2014, detailing the specifics and admitting that he was aware some of the females \ninvolved were underage. In May 2019, when interviewed by a government investigator, \nApplicant stated that he never searched for or viewed child pornography and only came \nacross it two to three times when he was searching mainstream pornography sites. This \ncontradicts statements he made to the polygraph examiner in 2014. The evidence \nsupports that Applicant deliberately falsified facts during his May 2019 interview with a \ngovernment investigator. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nI have addressed the security concerns under Guideline D and the same analysis \napplies under Guideline E. Applicant viewed child pornography over four years. This is \nnot minor and casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. He deliberately \nfalsified material facts about his behavior when he was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator and contradicted statements he made during his polygraph interview. \nProviding false information to a government investigator is not minor. Although, Applicant \nsays he no longer views any pornography and has taken steps to change his lifestyle, I \nfound his conflicting statements and minimizing his conduct troublesome. Applicant \ntestified that if others became aware of his past conduct it might impact his professional \nand personal relationships. There is insufficient evidence to apply any of the above \nmitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion regarding his past sexual behavior and personal conduct. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guidelines D, sexual behavior and E, personal conduct. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate alcohol consumption concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or \nto hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 18, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing reasons why \nunder the alcohol consumption guideline the DoD could not make the preliminary \naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 30, 2021 and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on June 22, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for July 18, 2022 \nby Teams Conference Services and was adjourned when Applicant failed to appear for \nher hearing. For good cause shown, the case was rescheduled for August 10, 2022, by \nTeams Conference Services, and was heard on the rescheduled date. At the hearing, \nthe Government\u2019s case consisted of three exhibits (GEs 1-3). Applicant relied on her \nown testimony and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 22, 2022. \nProcedural issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with additional medical records \n(inclusive of updates in her diagnosis and prognosis) and endorsements. For good \ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. Department \nCounsel was afforded four days to respond. (Tr. 14) \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented her treatment records \ncovering the period of September 11, 2018, through September 2018, and again for the \nperiod of July 2019 through August 2019, with an intervening three-week period of \ntreatment with B Facility. However, she did not provide any documentation of updated \ndiagnoses and prognoses, continuing aftercare, inclusive of participation in Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA), or endorsements from therapists, family, friends, supervisors, and \ncoworkers who are familiar with her alcohol issues. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline G, Applicant allegedly (a) consumed alcohol, at times in excess \nand to the point of intoxication, from about September 2018 to at least July 2019; (b) \nconsumed alcohol to the point of intoxication daily; (c) received treatment at A Facility \nfrom about September 2018 to September 2018, for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol \nUse Disorder (Severe); received treatment at A Facility from about March 2019 to about \nApril 2019, for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe); (e) received \ntreatment at A Facility from about July 2019 to about July 2019, for a condition \ndiagnosed as Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe); (f) failed to follow treatment advice as \nrecommended by A Facility; and (g) continues to consume alcohol, notwithstanding her \ntreatment for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe), as set for the in \nsubparagraph 1-e. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations without \nexplanations or clarifications.

(GE 1; Tr. 21) She has one child, a daughter (age 6), from \nthis marriage. (GEs 1-2 and AE C; Tr. 21) She earned a high school diploma in May \n2003. (GE 1) Applicant attended college classes between August 2003 and July 2019 \nwithout earning a degree or diploma. (GE 1) Applicant reported no military service. \nSince September 2014, Applicant has been employed by her current employer \nas an administrative assistant. (GEs 1-2) Previously, she worked for other employers in \nvarious jobs. (GE 1) She is currently sponsored for a security clearance by her current \nemployer, but has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol background history \nApplicant was introduced to alcohol at the age 21 and initially consumed alcohol \none to two times a month prior to January 2017. (GE 2) Her alcohol beverage of choice \nranged from beer to hard liquor that she typically purchased from a local liquor store. \n(GE 2) Between January 2017 and September 2018, Applicant consumed alcohol at the \nrate of two to three times a day and on an average of three to four days a week. Most of \nher alcohol was generally consumed in her home and was generally triggered by bouts \nof depression and anxiety stemming from the abusive actions of her husband. (GE 2; \nTr. 20) Applicant\u2019s drinking, often to intoxication levels produced outbursts of anger, and \nadversely affected her friendships. (GEs 2-3) \nBefore seeking formal alcohol counseling, Applicant reached out to Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) and other support groups for help with her alcohol issues. (GE 2) Her \nefforts produced positive reductions in the amount of alcohol she regularly consumed. \n(GEs 1-2) It was only after she finally realized that her excessive drinking was causing \nher major adverse reactions and potential consequences at work that she first tried \nscaling back on her alcohol consumption before turning to AA and other support groups \nfor help. (GE 2 and AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s treatment admissions \nFaced with some hard choices about addressing her alcohol issues she \nattributed to increasing levels of anxiety and depression, Applicant self-admitted herself \nto A Facility for inpatient detox and evaluation on September 11, 2018. (GE 3 and AE A) \nIn her intake information assessment, she identified drinking \u201cfor a long time,\u201d citing \nmarital conflicts and verbal abuse from her husband. (GE 3 and AEs A-C; Tr. 20-21) \nResponding to her husband\u2019s physical and emotional abuse, Applicant turned to \nalcohol to \u201cnumb\u201d her emotions. (GEs 2-3) She identified disturbances in sleep and \nappetite, feelings of isolation and withdrawal, loss of interest, loss of energy, and \ndecreased motivation to her A Facility treatment counselors in her intake interview.

Prior \nto discharge, she was diagnosed with co-medical disorders, with Alcohol Abuse \nDisorder (Severe) forming the primary diagnosis and Major Depressive Disorder \nfollowing as a co-existing and secondary disorder. (GE 3) \nApplicant was discharged from A Facility on September 14, 2018 with \nrecommended follow-up appointments at a recovery and wellness facility for continued \nrehabilitation. (GE 3 and AE A) Before her discharge, A Facility counselors prescribed \nmultiple psychiatric medications. Medical counselors at A Facility assigned a fair \nprognosis to Applicant upon discharge, contingent upon her continued follow-up with \nrecommended outpatient treatment centers and resumption of her AA meetings. (GE 3 \nand AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s assessed mental status preceding her September 14, 2018 discharge \nfrom A Facility was credited with improvement and increased stability in mood, with \nnoted less anxiety and depression symptoms. (GE 3 and AE A) She was credited by her \ncounselors on discharge with some improvements in insight and judgment. Follow-up \nappointments were recommended with the facility\u2019s recovery and wellness center for \ncontinuation of rehab follow-up. (GE 3 and AE A) And, continued psychiatric \nmanagement was also required of Applicant, as a part of the discharge order entered by \nApplicant\u2019s attending A Facility physician. (GE 3) \nFollowing her discharge from A Facility in September 2018, Applicant sought \nadditional help and support through AA (timing and spacing of her meetings \nundisclosed) at meeting locations near her home. (GE 2 and AE B; Tr. 20-21) And, for a \nfew months following her A Facility discharge, she was able to remain alcohol-free with \nthe help of AA. (GE 2; Tr. 16) \nBy early 2019, Applicant relapsed and returned to consuming alcohol at the rate \nof two to three times per week (consuming two to three glasses of wine per sitting). (GE \n2 and AE B; Tr. 17-18) Over the course of the ensuing four months, she increased her \nalcohol intake to three to four times a week (three to four beverages per sitting) \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption during this period caused her to experience adverse \nphysical and mental affects in the form of \u201cstaggering and anger.\u201d (GE 2) \nCompounding Applicant\u2019s emotional disturbances and depression was a surgical \nprocedure to her back that she underwent in September 2018. (GEs 2 and 3; Tr. 16) \nThe recovery protocols for her procedure included painkillers that were sometimes \nchallenging to tolerate. (Tr. 22) Unable to return to work following her surgery, she tried \nto self-medicate herself with alcohol to address her boredom.

(AE B; Tr. 18-19) A Facility\u2019s treatment records document \nan admission diagnosis for Applicant of alcoholism, triggered in part by diagnosed \ndepression (a co-disorder diagnosis). (AE B) Applicant\u2019s indicated treatment plan \nformulated by her medical counselors at A Facility was designed primarily to address \nher alcohol relapse issues associated with her abusive marriage. \nAfter spending two months in A Facility\u2019s outpatient unit (following her initial \nevaluation and detox in the Facility\u2019s inpatient unit between April and May 2019, \nApplicant was discharged from the facility in July 2019 with an updated diagnosis of \nAlcohol Use Disorder in remission and Major Depressive Disorder (recurrent, mild) and \nan assigned fair prognosis, and referred to a rehabilitation center (B Facility). \nApplicant\u2019s medical records document B Facility attendance between July and \nAugust 2019. (AE B) After completing her outpatient therapy at B Facility in August \n2019, she returned to A Facility for six additional sessions of outpatient therapy in \nAugust and September 2019. (AEs B-C; Tr. 19) \nApplicant\u2019s A Facility discharge summary of August 23, 2019, credited Applicant \nwith increased coping skills and more comfortable with AA meeting attendance. Her \ntreatment sessions did not include any family sessions, and she was urged to work on \nher sobriety and depression issues, identify an outpatient group and family therapist to \nimprove her coping skills and build her self-esteem. (AEs B-C) \nUpon discharge from A Facility to her home. Applicant was assigned a discharge \ndiagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe, and in remission) and generalized Anxiety \ndisorder. (AEs B-C) She was given a fair prognosis, contingent on her continuing her \nmedications, keeping her follow-up appointments with a family counselor to help her \nwith her coping communications, anxiety, depression, maintaining her sobriety avoiding \nrelapses, and sustaining her abstention from alcohol use. (AEs B-C) \nSince her discharge from A Facility in September 2019, Applicant assured that \nshe has abstained from alcohol consumption since her last drink in July 2019.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. The AGs list guidelines to be considered \nby judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines \ntake into account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the \nindividual applicant, as well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThe AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Treatment admissions included both inpatient and outpatient \nsessions designed to promote her recovery from diagnosed alcohol-abuse disorder. \nOn the strength of the evidence documented in the record, four disqualifying \nconditions (DCs) of the alcohol consumption guideline apply. DCs \u00b6\u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or \nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether \nthe individual is diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder\u201d; 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly \nqualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, \npsychiatrist, or licensed social worker) of alcohol use disorder\u201d; 22(e), \u201cthe failure to \nfollow treatment advice once diagnosed\u201d; and 22(f), \u201calcohol consumption, which is not \nin accordance with treatment recommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use \ndisorder,\u201d are all applicable to the facts of record in Applicant\u2019s case. \nWhile recognizing her mistakes in judgment associated with her recurrent periods \nof abusive drinking, even after receiving counseling and treatment of abusing alcohol, \nApplicant\u2019s abusive drinking is extenuated in considerable part by the abusive marital \nrelationship she endured for over seven years. With her divorce in October 2020, she \nno longer feels any need to self-medicate with alcohol to overcome the emotional \nstresses in her life. Base on the evidence presented, Applicant may take advantage of \nseveral mitigating conditions MCs. MCs \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the \nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment\u201d; 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her pattern of \nmaladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations\u201d; and 23(d),\u201d the individual \nhas successfully completed a treatment program along with any required aftercare, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation in this case. \nBased on the composite of demonstrated corrective actions taken by Applicant \nsince she consumed alcohol in July 2019, especially her escape from an abusive \nmarriage in 2020, Applicant can be credited with making considerable progress in the \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \nmanagement of her mental health and alcohol intake since her 2019 discharge from A \nFacility in 2019. Validation of her maintaining her sobriety over the past three years \ncannot be accepted on the basis of her assurances alone. Before she can be fully \ncleared of relapse risks, both an updated diagnosis and prognosis are needed to clear \naway any doubts about her recurrence risks. \nOffered an opportunity to provide a medical update and endorsements from \ntherapists, supervisors, coworkers, family, and friends who are familiar with her past \nalcohol issues and her progress in avoiding alcohol over the past three years, Applicant \ndid not provide any updates or endorsements to corroborate her assurances and satisfy \nthe post-discharge recommendations of her A Facility treating professionals. \nThe emotional distress that Applicant endured from her abusive and ultimately \nbroken marriage is extenuating and mitigating. However, the circumstances that \nprompted her to turn to abusive drinking to self-medicate her emotional issues (both \nthose triggered by her husband\u2019s abuse and those associated from her personal \nexperiences of boredom) are not enough to relieve her of her responsibilities of \nsatisfying the post-discharge recommendations of her A Facility treating professionals. \nWithout an updated diagnosis and prognosis from an aftercare therapy group \nApplicant\u2019s abstinence assurances cannot be solely relied upon at this time that \nApplicant can (a) maintain her established abstinence and (b) is at no meaningful risk to \nreturn to alcohol abuse in the foreseeable future.

Since her discharge from treatment and rehabilitation in \nSeptember 2019, she has made considerable progress in managing her alcohol-related \nissues and shows good promise in sustaining her abstinence in the future. She \ndeserves considerable credit as well for her contributions to the defense industry. Based \non the evidence presented, though, it is still too soon to absolve of risks of recurrence \nbased on the developed record. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

(Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On March 26, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F.

On February 25, 2022, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for March 29, 2022. (HE 1) His hearing was held as scheduled using the DOD \nMicrosoft Teams video teleconference system. (Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; Applicant did not \noffer any exhibits; and all exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 10-12, 15-16; GE \n1-GE 3) On April 13, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.d. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. Additional findings follow.  \nApplicant is 51 years old, and he works on a computer interface system for a DOD \ncontractor. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 1989, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6, 8) In 2018, he \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree with a major in electrical engineering. (Tr. 6-7) He served in \nthe Navy from 1989 to 2009, and he honorably retired as a petty officer first class (E-6). \n(Tr. 7) His Navy rating was electrician\u2019s mate. (Tr. 7) \nApplicant married in 1992, and he divorced in 1993. (Tr. 8) In 2005, Applicant \nmarried, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 8) There is no evidence that Applicant \nused illegal drugs, violated security, engaged in criminal conduct, or engaged in \nexcessive alcohol consumption. (GE 1; GE 2) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $74,000. (Tr. 28) He receives an additional \n$20,000 in Navy retirement benefits. (Tr. 28) His spouse is not employed outside their \nhome. (Tr. 29) He is able to pay his bills; however, he does not have excess funds for \nsavings and investments. (Tr. 29-30) He has about $25,000 in a Thrift Savings Plan and \na 401(k) account. (Tr. 30) Around 2019, Applicant\u2019s spouse had medical problems, and \nshe left her employment. (Tr. 31) He has not had financial counseling. (Tr. 31)  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege and Applicant admitted that he failed to file his federal \nand state income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2012 through 2019 as of the date of the \nSOR, March 26, 2021. (HE 3) He failed to timely file his tax return for TY 2010. In \nsubsequent years, he believed he could not file tax returns for later TYs because he \nneeded information from the previous tax return for the next tax return. (Tr. 18) His tax \nreturns for TYs 2012 and 2013 were filed; however, his tax returns for TYs 2014 through \n2019 were filed in June 2021. (Tr. 20, 21) Applicant said he electronically submitted his \ntax returns for TY 2014 through 2019 in the December 2020 to January 2021 timeframe. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(Tr. 17, 22) He did not present a receipt or documentation for the electronic filing in the \nDecember 2020 to January 2021 timeframe. (Tr. 23) About six months later, he contacted \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to check the status of taxes, and he learned the IRS \ndid not have his tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2019. (Tr. 23) He subsequently \nresubmitted them electronically; then he checked with the IRS in September or October \nof 2021; and he learned the IRS had not received his tax returns. (Tr. 23) He mailed paper \ncopies of his federal income tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2019 using certified mail. \n(Tr. 17, 24) At the time of his hearing, he said he believed all of his federal income tax \nreturns were filed. (Tr. 19-20) He was aware of his tax-filing responsibilities, and he chose \nnot to take timely actions to file his tax returns because he was intimidated by the process \nof getting his tax issues resolved. (Tr. 34) He said he was \u201chiding from [the] problem.\u201d (Tr. \n35) \nThe IRS tax transcript for TY 2016 indicates in July 2019, the IRS calculated his \ntaxes due; the balance owed on November 23, 2020, was $10,506; and no payments, \nother than monthly withholding from salary, are reflected on the tax transcript. (GE 2 at \n21-22) The IRS tax transcript for TY 2017 indicates in March 2020, the IRS calculated his \ntaxes due; the balance owed on November 23, 2020, was $9,511; and no payments, \nother than monthly withholding from salary, are reflected on the tax transcript. (GE 2 at \n25-26) The November 6, 2020 IRS tax transcripts for TYs 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019 \ndid not indicate any tax returns were filed, and the IRS did not calculate his tax liability for \nthose tax years. \nApplicant acknowledged that he did not file his state tax returns for TYs 2014 to \n2019. (Tr. 26) The state calculated his state taxes for several years, and garnished his \npay. (Tr. 26) He was unsure which TYs were calculated, filed, paid, or resolved. (Tr. 26) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege and Applicant admitted that he owes federal income \ntaxes of $10,506 for TY 2016 and $9,506 for TY 2017, respectively. (HE 3) He estimated \nthat he owed the IRS between $30,000 and $50,000 for TYs 2014 through 2019. (Tr. 24-\n25) He tried to refinance his house previously; however, the lender would not loan him \nfunds because of his tax situation. (Tr. 33) He intends to borrow the funds from his mother \nto pay his tax debt, and then he intends to refinance his house and use the proceeds to \nrepay his mother. (Tr. 17) He estimated that he has about $100,000 of equity in his home. \n(Tr. 25) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions and the applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra.  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \nApplicant indicated two circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his \nfinances: (1) unemployment of his spouse; and (2) illness of his spouse. However, \u201c[e]ven \nif [an applicant\u2019s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside his [or her] control, the [administrative judge] could still consider \nwhether [the applicant] has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd.

A willful failure to timely make (means complete \nand file with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal \noffense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . . make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2019, the DOHA Appeal Board \nhas commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.

June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nApplicant did not mitigate the federal and state tax security concerns. The amount \nof taxes he owes the federal and state governments is unknown. He did not prove that he \nwas unable to make greater progress sooner filing his federal and state income tax returns \nfor TYs 2014 through 2019, and he did not establish he was unable to start making \npayments on his delinquent taxes. He failed to establish mitigation of financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 51 years old, and he works on a computer interface system for a DOD \ncontractor. In 2018, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree with a major in electrical engineering. \nHe served in the Navy from 1989 to 2009, and he honorably retired as a petty officer first \nclass. His Navy rating was electrician\u2019s mate. There is no evidence that Applicant used \nillegal drugs, violated security, engaged in criminal conduct, or engaged in excessive \nalcohol consumption.  \nApplicant did not provide a good reason for his procrastination in filing and paying \nhis state and federal income taxes. The only areas of financial irresponsibility are his \nhistory of failing to timely file his federal and state income tax returns and timely pay any \ntaxes when due. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination\u201d that applicant has been \nrehabilitated). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an \nobligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, \nfailure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d). \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a case where the applicant \nfiled his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and his 2012 tax return in \nAugust 2015, all before the SOR was issued. The applicant in that case owed less than \n$1,800 in federal income taxes for those four TYs at the time of the decision. Id. The \nAppeal Board found the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be an important factor \nstating: \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission \nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background \ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the \ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that \nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies.

However, \nlike the applicant in ISCR Case No. 15-03481, he did not establish he was unable to make \ngreater progress sooner in the resolution of his financial issues. His actions under the \nAppeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of timely filing and paying his taxes, \nand a better record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

Although she has thrived on the job and has \nnot been intoxicated since the episode that prompted her to seek intensive outpatient \ntreatment in 2016, she continues to drink alcohol despite a diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence. Under these circumstances, the potential of relapse generates an \nunacceptable security risk.

(AE E) \nApplicant has a drinking problem. She began drinking alcohol in 2007. At that time, \nshe drank \u201ca couple of drinks a couple nights per week,\u201d primarily to help her sleep. (Tr.\n111; Answer at 1) Her drinking gradually increased over the years. By 2014, she was\ndrinking up to eight shots of vodka daily, and drinking continuously from 6 pm, when she\ncame home from work, to bedtime. (Tr. 114; 187) Alcohol use contributed to the\ndeterioration of her marriage. (GE 2 at 28)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOne night in July 2016, Applicant fell down the steps in her home while intoxicated. \n(GE 2 at 38) She required emergency medical treatment. (Id.) For the next few months, \nApplicant tried to reduce her alcohol consumption, but was unsuccessful. In October 2016, \nshe voluntarily enrolled in an intensive outpatient alcohol treatment program. (Answer at 1; \nTr. 73) Such programs are less intensive than an inpatient program, but more intensive \nthan a traditional outpatient program. (GE 3) She attended the program for three months. \nWhile receiving treatment, a psychologist diagnosed her with alcohol dependence. (GE 2 at \n39; Answer at 1) \nApplicant\u2019s outpatient program included group counseling and alcoholics \nanonymous (AA) meetings. (GE 2 at 8, 15) While abstinent from alcohol, Applicant \nexperienced \u201cnormal recovery symptoms,\u201d including emotional outbursts, decreased \nappetite, and weight loss. (GE 2 at 32) She was actively involved in group therapy, offering \nconstructive and valuable feedback to other group members. (GE 2 at 14) \nDuring New Year\u2019s Eve of 2016, while out of town, Applicant drank two cocktails. \n(Tr. 86) She was still working with the intensive outpatient program at the time. Applicant \ncharacterized her decision to have the drinks as \u201csomewhat intentional.\u201d (Tr. 87) By \nFebruary 2017, Applicant began to believe that she had overcome her addiction to alcohol. \n(Tr. 142) \nIn April 2017, Applicant resumed drinking alcohol. (Tr. 90) By this time, she had \nenrolled in another alcohol-addiction recovery program. (Tr. 91) Unlike AA, it was secular, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nand per Applicant, it was based upon developing the ability to consume alcohol in \u201ca \nresponsible way,\u201d as opposed to abstaining from alcohol, as prescribed by the intensive \noutpatient program. (Tr. 91) She found what she understood to be the moderation model to \nbe better than the abstinence model. Specifically, she found the faith-based AA component \nto be ineffective. (Tr. 87) Her opinion about the inefficiency of faith-based alcohol recovery \nprograms is supported by research. Specifically, a study published in Journal of Substance \nAbuse Treatment concluded that individuals with a more secular worldview may find it \ndifficult to fit into a spiritually-based recovery program and are more likely to be engaged in \na secular group, \u201cthus improving the prognosis for long-term abstinence.\u201d (AE K at 3) \nUnder the moderation model, users plan how many drinks they are going to have in \na week, together with the days that they are going to drink. (Tr. 93, 161) They then record \ntheir drinking on an app and record whether they are on target or over target. (AE O) Using \nthis model, Applicant has been consuming approximately one to two drinks per sitting, \nthree days per week. (Tr. 163) She has not been intoxicated since the incident when she \nfell down the stairs. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s testimony, the alcohol-addiction program that she is \nparticipating in is not moderation-based. Rather, per the program\u2019s online profile, it is \n\u201corganized to support people who have chosen to abstain or who are considering doing \nso.\u201d (GE 7) Furthermore, the program\u2019s online profile states, as follows: \nDespite participant statements about \u2018cutting back\u2019 or moderating, the \nworking time of the meeting[s] [are] devoted to how to achieve \nabstinence . . . (GE 7) (emphasis added by publisher of online profile) \nAnother Smart Recovery program outline, submitted by Applicant\u2019s counsel, \nstates that Applicant\u2019s recovery plan is equally effective as conventional programs in \nhelping people overcome alcohol disorders. (AE N) Per the manager, a licensed \nsocial worker with the outpatient treatment program that Applicant attended \nbetween 2016 and 2017, \u201cif you were diagnosed with the chronic disease of \naddiction/alcoholism, one is never cured.\u201d (GE 4) Such people need ongoing \nrecovery activities, including maintaining abstinence. (GE 4) \nApplicant has been seeing her family doctor since 2006. (AE P) He is aware \nthat she participated in an intensive outpatient program for alcohol dependency. \nShe continues to have regular follow-up visits with him. Per the family doctor, she \n\u201cdoes not currently have a diagnosis of alcohol dependency . . . , is maintaining a \nsafe and healthy lifestyle,\u201d and has no indicators of high-risk behaviors or substance \nabuse.\u201d (AE P) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nUnder AG \u00b6 21, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d In the mid-2010s, Applicant frequently \nconsumed alcohol to excess. During the high point of her drinking problem, she was \ndrinking up to eight shots of vodka daily. A fall down the stairs while intoxicated precipitated \nemergency medical care. It also prompted Applicant to enroll in an intensive outpatient \nprogram where a psychiatrist subsequently diagnosed her with alcohol dependence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant generally complied with the addiction recovery program, she relapsed \nwhile in treatment and she resumed drinking alcohol in April 2017. Under these \ncircumstances, the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol-use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol-use\ndisorder; \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker \nof alcohol use disorder); and \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 22 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no \nprevious history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with the \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant drank two drinks on New Year\u2019s Eve, approximately one month after she \nbegan the treatment program in 2016. She resumed alcohol consumption in April 2017, \napproximately one month after completing the program. AG \u00b6 23(d) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant is currently participating in a treatment program, she has a \nhistory of relapse, as she resumed drinking after completing an alcohol treatment program \nin 2017. Consequently, AG \u00b6 23(c) is only partially applicable. \nAfter the episode where Applicant tripped down the stairs while intoxicated, she \nacknowledged her drinking problem and enrolled in intensive outpatient therapy. Although \nshe has not been intoxicated since the tripping incident, and has been drinking in \nmoderation since then, this modified consumption has not been in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. Consequently, AG \u00b6 23(b) is only partially applicable. \nThe crux of her case is that Applicant believes she has learned to drink in \nmoderation based upon ongoing therapy she is receiving from an alcohol recovery \nprogram, which focuses on moderation rather than abstinence. Information presented by \nboth parties shows Applicant\u2019s contention is fundamentally flawed. The goal of the program \nin which she is now involved, like the traditional AA model, is based upon abstinence, not \nmoderation. \nApplicant additionally contends that faith-based programs, such as AA are \nineffective for people who are not religious. This argument is a red herring because both \nAA and Applicant\u2019s secular program are predicated upon abstinence, and Applicant is \ncurrently not abstinent from alcohol. Whether the program is religious or secular is \nirrelevant. \nApplicant\u2019s family doctor evaluated her in January 2022 and concluded that she is \nno longer dependent on alcohol. There is no record evidence, however, that her family \ndoctor is an addictions specialist. Moreover, there is no record evidence that he reviewed \nApplicant\u2019s previous health record of alcohol addiction before reaching his conclusion. \nUnder these circumstances, this report has limited probative value, and as such, does not \nestablish that Applicant\u2019s drinking problem is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. I conclude that AG \u00b6 22(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nApplicant has not been intoxicated in six years. She is excelling on the job and is \nhighly respected, both at work and in the community. However, she is alcohol dependent \nand is still drinking alcohol. Although her consumption is moderate, it is not consistent with \nthe recommendation of the intensive outpatient program that she attended in 2016, to \nabstain from alcohol consumption. The nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s decision to \ndrink alcohol despite her alcohol dependence diagnosis outweighs the positive information \nabout her work performance and the length of time since she was last intoxicated. Under \nthese circumstances, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nabout her use of alcohol. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 59 years old. He has been married to his second wife since 1998. He has two grown children from his first marriage and he and his wife have two teenage children together. After high school, he served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1981 to 2002, retiring as a master sergeant (E-7). Since 2002, he has been employed as an avionics manager for a defense contractor. He has held a security clearance for about 40 years, since his time in the Air Force, without incident. (Tr. 26-31, 68-69, 81; GE 1; GE 3) In early January 2017, Applicant went out drinking with some friends. He had two drinks at a bar, came home, and drank some more. His wife and daughters became concerned about his excessive alcohol use and drove him to the hospital. (GE 2, GE 3) Hospital records reflect that Applicant was examined and diagnosed with acute alcohol intoxication and alcohol use disorder. Notes also reflect that the treating physician had a lengthy discussion with Applicant and his family about his alcohol level and abnormal liver function tests. At the time, Applicant indicated that he was concerned about seeking alcohol treatment due to fear of losing his job. Notes re",

The case was \nassigned to me on January 12, 2022. On January 26, 2022, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling the hearing for February 17, \n2022. The hearing was to take place by video-teleconference, through an on-line \nplatform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5. GE 1 and GE 2 were admitted without objection. \nApplicant objected to GE 3 and GE 4, but the objections were overruled (Tr. 17-18) GE \n5, a summary of Applicant\u2019s background interview, was not admitted. (Tr. 19-21) \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and AE B, which were \nmarked and admitted without objection. I left the record open to provide Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional evidence. He timely submitted additional exhibits, which \nwere marked and admitted without objection as AE C through AE J. They are described \nin the Facts section, below. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 22, \n2022. The record closed on March 4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c and the cross-allegation, SOR \u00b6 2.a; and he \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 59 years old. He has been married to his second wife since 1998. He \nhas two grown children from his first marriage and he and his wife have two teenage \nchildren together. After high school, he served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from \n1981 to 2002, retiring as a master sergeant (E-7). Since 2002, he has been employed \nas an avionics manager for a defense contractor. He has held a security clearance for \nabout 40 years, since his time in the Air Force, without incident. (Tr. 26-31, 68-69, 81; \nGE 1; GE 3) \nIn early January 2017, Applicant went out drinking with some friends. He had two \ndrinks at a bar, came home, and drank some more. His wife and daughters became \nconcerned about his excessive alcohol use and drove him to the hospital. (GE 2, GE 3) \nHospital records reflect that Applicant was examined and diagnosed with acute \nalcohol intoxication and alcohol use disorder. Notes also reflect that the treating \nphysician had a lengthy discussion with Applicant and his family about his alcohol level \nand abnormal liver function tests. At the time, Applicant indicated that he was \nconcerned about seeking alcohol treatment due to fear of losing his job.

He was discharged and advised to \nfollow up with his doctor, and to pursue outpatient alcohol treatment. (GE 2 at 6-7, 39, \nGE 3) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) \nApplicant did not pursue alcohol treatment following his 2017 ER visit. His \nprimary care doctor later told him to stop drinking and Applicant attempted to lessen his \ndrinking gradually. He said he got down to two beers and then \u201cshot myself in the foot \nand almost blew it.\u201d (Tr. 57, 60) A follow-up visit in 2018 with the same doctor he saw in \nhis 2017 ER visit (Dr. A) reflects that she questioned his judgment, as he knew he had a \nproblem with alcohol yet was not doing anything to address it. (GE 3 at 3, 5) \nApplicant testified that he first consumed alcohol at age 18, in the military. He \noften drank beer and wine overseas, where social drinking was commonplace. Records \nreflect that between 1997 and 2017, he drank beer and wine, mostly on weekends. \nDuring his hearing testimony, Applicant acknowledged that he had been drinking too \nmuch, and had not been ready to stop drinking, calling himself \u201chard-headed.\u201d (Tr. 31-\n34, 47-53, 57-59, 70; GE 3)  \nIn March 2020, at the DOD CAF\u2019s request, Applicant participated in an evaluation \nby a licensed clinical psychologist. (GE 3, GE 4) The evaluator reviewed his medical \nrecords from his 2017 ER visit, other medical records, his security clearance paperwork, \nand conducted a clinical interview and appropriate testing of Applicant. The evaluator \nnoted that Applicant \u201chas a habit of severely minimizing his history of alcohol abuse,\u201d \nincluding the events surrounding his 2017 ER visit, which he failed to mention, and any \nperiods when he drank excessively, which he denied. (GE 3 at 3, 5) \nAs Applicant\u2019s provider did in 2018, the evaluator expressed concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s insight and judgment, lack of treatment, and ongoing alcohol consumption \nwith no plan or intent to abstain. She diagnosed Applicant with severe alcohol use \ndisorder, with a guarded prognosis. (GE 3 at 5) She found that his condition \u201cmay make \nhim prone to lapses of judgment, thereby posing a risk to his reliability and/or \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information.\u201d (GE 3 at 6) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.a) \nIn early July 2020, at the advice of his family, Applicant voluntarily entered an \ninpatient substance abuse treatment program. Applicant testified that he remained at \nthe facility, and in the program, an extra two weeks, until he was discharged \nsuccessfully in mid-August 2020. The program was designed to integrate participants \ninto Alcoholics Anonymous and its 12-step program, with daily meetings and \nsponsorship. (Tr. 36-38, 73; AE B) \nApplicant\u2019s case manager at the facility noted that he was an \u201cabsolute joy\u201d to \nwork with; he was consistently attentive, cooperative, and respectful, and appreciative \nof the opportunity to learn, grow, and change. The case manager gave him what was \nessentially a positive prognosis, assuming he remained clean and sober. He was \nadvised to meet with his primary care physician, a counselor, and his sponsor, and to \ncontinue 12-step AA meetings daily for 90 days.

They had 28 sessions over the next year, as \nof August 2021. Applicant was diagnosed with adjustment disorder and mixed anxiety \nand depressed mood, as well as alcohol use disorder, in remission. He presented as \n\u201clucid, calm, and cooperative in each of our teletherapy sessions.\u201d (AE A; Tr. 42-45) (I \nnote that these teletherapy sessions took place during the ongoing COVID-19 \npandemic). \nThe counselor\u2019s handwritten notes do not reflect information on Applicant\u2019s then-\ncurrent drinking habits (if any), and a prognosis is not indicated. The document does not \naddress whether, and if so, to what extent, the fact that Applicant\u2019s condition is now in \nremission has impacted his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness with respect to \nclassified information. (AE A) \nPrior to his March 2020 evaluation, Applicant had never had any alcohol \ntreatment or other professional counseling. He acknowledged that his several attempts \nto curtail his drinking on his own were unsuccessful. He went to inpatient rehabilitation \n(in July 2020) because he finally recognized that he needed help. He said he was \ncomfortable there because the center has military clientele. He said this treatment was \n\u201cthe answer.\u201d (Tr. 71) He reported his inpatient treatment to his supervisor at work and \nsaid they were \u201cvery understanding.\u201d Tr. 60-64) \nApplicant acknowledged that he had continued drinking after he was diagnosed \nwith severe alcohol use disorder, in March 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) However, he said that he \nhad not consumed alcohol at all since before he entered inpatient treatment in July \n2020. By the time the record closed, he had abstained from alcohol for one year and \neight months. (Tr. 35-36, 46, 78; AE J) \nApplicant testified that he has no alcohol in his house. He takes no medication to \ntreat his alcohol issues. He has never had an alcohol-related arrest or driving offense, \nsuch as a DUI, and he has never had an alcohol-related incident at work. (Tr. 59-60, 64-\n65, 70)  \nApplicant testified that he had been going to AA with a sponsor, several nights a \nweek for 10-12 months (Aug 2020 to summer 2021), then backed off to a few nights a \nweek, due to the pandemic and also due to a shift change at work in fall 2021. He \nattended AA once in January 2022, but not since then. (Tr. 38-42, 73-75) He said he \nhas a sponsor, and intended to resume counseling and AA attendance. (Tr. 65-66) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant re-contacted his counselor and indicated an interest \nin resuming monthly sessions with her. She responded and indicated that she was \nretiring, but that he would be contacted by a new therapist. (AE G) Applicant had not \nparticipated in counseling with his therapist since about August 2021.

He maintains responsibility for highly sensitive communications \nequipment. A longtime employee asserted that Applicant is an exemplary manager. The \nemployee credited Applicant with asking for help (with his alcohol issues) when he \nneeded it. Applicant exhibits integrity, leadership, and mission awareness. He performs \nhis job well and can be trusted by the U.S. Government. (AE C \u2013 AE F) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist; psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) or alcohol use disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n(f) alcohol consumption which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \nApplicant has a history of engaging in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol. \nAccording to his medical records, he was consuming one to two bottles of wine a day at \nthe time of his ER visit in January 2017. AG \u00b6 22(c) applies. \nApplicant was then diagnosed with alcohol use disorder by his treating physician, \nand advised to pursue substance abuse treatment following his discharge. He indicated \nthat he was not ready to stop drinking, and did not pursue substance abuse treatment at \nthat time. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) apply to those circumstances. \nDuring his March 2020 DOD CAF psychological evaluation, Applicant was \ndiagnosed with severe alcohol use disorder. AG \u00b6 22(d) applies to that diagnosis. The \npsychologist noted his continued poor insight into his alcohol problems at that point, and \nshe concluded that he was unwilling to pursue treatment and would continue drinking. \nIndeed, Applicant indicated that he continued drinking until July 2020, when he entered \ninpatient treatment. AG \u00b6 22(e) and 22(f) are again satisfied. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23.

He has \na history of excessive alcohol consumption that he has only recently come to terms with \nand is properly addressing. He was first diagnosed with alcohol use disorder in January \n2017 when, in a state of \u201cacute intoxication,\u201d he was taken to the ER by his family. In \nMarch 2020, he was diagnosed with severe alcohol use disorder by a DOD evaluator. \nAgain with the assistance of his family, he entered inpatient alcohol treatment in July \n2020, before the SOR was issued. He was attentive, cooperative, respectful, and \nappreciative of the opportunity to address his alcohol issues, and he completed the \ntreatment successfully in mid-August 2020. Though Applicant did acknowledge earlier \nrelapses before he sought formal treatment, there is no record evidence that he has \nconsumed any alcohol in the 20 months since then, and there is no evidence of \nsubsequent relapse. \nFollowing his discharge from inpatient treatment, Applicant participated in a year \nof counseling sessions, as well as AA, with a sponsor, as recommended. In August \n2021, his counselor diagnosed him with alcohol use disorder, in remission. His \nparticipation in both counseling and AA either ended or tapered off after that, in part due \nto his work schedule, and in part due to the pandemic, which made in-person \nparticipation difficult. During his hearing, Applicant indicated a desire to renew \ncounseling and AA, and had begun to do so by late February 2022. Applicant has a \nhistory of heavy alcohol consumption but has never had an issue with alcohol at work, \nnor does he have a record of any alcohol-related arrests, charges, or citations. He \nappears to have a strongly supportive family. All of this is to be considered, and largely \nin Applicant\u2019s favor, in weighing the specific mitigating conditions, both under Guideline \nG, and Guideline I, below. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not fully apply.

Even \nthough he is building up a track record of abstinence addressing his alcohol issues with \nappropriate counseling and support, it is difficult to say definitively that his issues are \nfully in his past.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) apply. Following appropriate participation, Applicant \nsuccessfully completed the inpatient treatment program in August 2020, and \nparticipated in counseling and AA as recommended, for about a year afterwards. There \nis no record evidence to dispute his statements that he has fully abstained from alcohol \nin the 20 months since he entered the program. Through that program, Applicant is \ncredited with acknowledging his alcohol issues for the first time, and with following \nthrough and abstaining from alcohol. He has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(c) does not fully apply but is given some consideration, because \nApplicant has not relapsed since his inpatient treatment. He is not in counseling \ncurrently, but is credited with renewing ties with his counselor after the hearing, with \nintentions of doing so. He also resumed connections with AA and with his sponsor. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set forth in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and  \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nApplicant\u2019s history of binge drinking constitutes behavior that casts doubt on his \njudgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness, and it is related to his condition (i.e., \nhis diagnosis of severe alcohol use disorder). However, since his behavior is alcohol-\nrelated (and alleged under Guideline G), it cannot be said that it is \u201cnot covered under \nany other guideline.\u201d It also was not cross-alleged under Guideline I. For these reasons, \nAG \u00b6 28(a) does not apply. \nAs noted, in March 2020, Applicant was referred by the DOD CAF for a \npsychological evaluation. He was diagnosed by a clinical psychologist with severe \nalcohol use disorder. The evaluator specifically found that his condition may make him \nprone to lapses of judgment, and therefore posed a risk to his reliability and \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information, AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. \nDuring his ER visit in January 2017, Applicant diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. He was advised to pursue outpatient alcohol treatment. He did not do that. \nSimilarly, he was diagnosed with severe alcohol use disorder by the DOD evaluator in \nMarch 2020, and indicated that he would continue drinking and would not pursue \ntreatment. While these treatment plans were recommended by his provider and the \nevaluator rather than formally prescribed, Applicant nonetheless failed to follow up and \npursue them. AG \u00b6 28(d) therefore at least partially applies. \nIn July and August 2020, at the recommendation of his family, Applicant \nvoluntarily participated in several weeks of inpatient alcohol treatment. It is not clear, \nhowever, that this treatment constituted \u201chospitalization.\u201d If it did, AG \u00b6 28(c) might \ntherefore technically apply, but Applicant\u2019s participation in that program is not alleged in \nthe SOR. Further, I consider that it is more mitigating than it is disqualifying. \nAG \u00b6 29 sets forth the potentially applicable Guideline I mitigating conditions: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the\nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the\ntreatment plan; \n \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(b) are partially established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol disorder is \nreadily controllable with treatment, and he has demonstrated compliance with his \ntreatment plan. He actively participated in and successfully completed several weeks of \ninpatient treatment in summer 2020, and has remained abstinent from alcohol ever \nsince. He participated in a year of aftercare counseling and AA. His participation waned \nlater in 2021, but he has resumed AA participation and re-contacted his counselor more \nrecently. His counselor diagnosed his alcohol use disorder as being in remission as of \nAugust 2021, though no prognosis was addressed. Nonetheless, while there is always a \nrisk of recurrence with any recovering alcoholic, AG \u00b6 29(e) fully applies since there is \nno indication of a current problem, given Applicant\u2019s demonstrated abstinence since \nbefore his inpatient treatment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G and Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has a history of heavy alcohol consumption, which led to a diagnosis of \nsevere alcohol use disorder. He later voluntarily entered inpatient treatment, and \ncompleted the program successfully. He is essentially a recovering alcoholic. His \nalcohol disorder is in remission, and he has a demonstrated track record of abstinence \nsince his treatment. He has never had an issue with alcohol at work, nor does he have a \nrecord of any alcohol-related arrests, charges, or citations. He appears to have a \nstrongly supportive family. I have also considered his lengthy career of service to the \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nnation, both in the Air Force and in the defense industry. Lastly, I had an opportunity to \nview his demeanor during the hearing and thus, to assess his credibility. I regard him as \na credible witness, and I believe his testimony that his outlook and attitude towards his \nalcohol issues changed for the better due to his inpatient treatment. I consider that, \nwhile there is always a risk of recurrence in alcohol cases like this, Applicant is \naddressing his issues with alcohol seriously and appropriately and has built up a track \nrecord of abstinence and sobriety, coupled with appropriate support mechanisms. In \nconsideration of his actions and his whole-person evidence, Applicant has met his \nburden to establish that his alcohol issues are being appropriately addressed and are \nno longer a security concern under either guideline alleged. Eligibility for continued \naccess to classified information is granted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nBraden M.

During 2016 through 2018, he paid for one cousin\u2019s college expenses \nfor two years \u2013 about $400 a month out-of-pocket \u2013 until she earned her licensed practical \nnurse (LPN) degree; and starting in 2016, until an unspecified date, he paid approximately \n$4,000 for another cousin\u2019s education until that individual could qualify for student loans. \nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife attended school to obtain her master\u2019s degree and her doctor of \nphilosophy in education over an eight-year period ending in the Fall of 2021, he paid for \nher education costs both out-of-pocket and by obtaining student loans. (Tr. at 48-40) \nApplicant also has a lengthy history of having federal or state tax liens filed against \nhim as well as having delinquent federal taxes. In his 2016 SF 86, Applicant \nacknowledged being delinquent in the amount of an estimated $25,000 for the sale of a \nresidence that he mistakenly thought was covered by an unspecified policy related to \nHurricane Katrina. (GE 1 at 46-47; Tr. at 63) \nHe was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on August 2, 2017. During that interview, he acknowledged two tax \nliens that were filed against him because he owed more taxes than he had expected. The \nfirst lien, in 2006, he estimated was for $30,000. The second lien, in 2007, he estimated \nwas also for $30,000. He disputed those liens but lost. He said that he started making \npayments in 2013, and that by December 2016, the 2006 lien was paid off. He expected \nto pay off the 2007 lien by 2018. He claimed the outstanding balance was $25,000, and \nthat his monthly payments were $1,036. He denied any additional liens or delinquent \naccounts. (GE 7 at 7) In fact, according to his installment agreement activity for the period \nJuly 2015 \u2013 July 2016, his beginning balance for 2006 was approximately $15,129, and \nthe beginning balance for 2007 was approximately $35,510, totaling for those two years \n$50,639. But, contrary to his claims, there were numerous other tax liens and delinquent \naccounts. Applicant\u2019s payments for 2006 were $7,229, and his payments for 2007 was \nzero. (Installment Agreement Activity, undated, attached to GE 7) \nThe SOR alleged two federal tax liens that remain unpaid; one state tax lien, since \nreleased; and seven still-delinquent federal tax accounts totaling approximately \n$198,373, as set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a federal tax lien in the approximate amount of $70,757, filed \nagainst him in 2008. It appears that the lien was for the 2006 and 2007 delinquent taxes, \nincluding interest and penalties. (GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 5) Applicant contended that in about \nApril 2009, he entered into an installment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) under which he started making monthly $800 payments that eventually increased \nto $1,900. (Tr. at 44-45) His contentions are not verified or supported by any \ndocumentation. The verifiable evidence generated by the IRS reveals that for nine months \nduring October 2016 through June 2017, Applicant made periodic monthly payments of \n$1,100 to be applied to delinquent taxes for the tax years 2006 and 2007. (IRS Processed \nPayments, undated, attached to Answer to the SOR) He also claimed that on an \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunspecified date he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS under which he \nwas making monthly payments of $1,920, and that he overpaid his 2020 taxes by $20,000 \nto be applied to any outstanding liens. (Answer to the SOR) He offered no documentation \nto verify or support his claim. Applicant admitted that his last payment for any of his tax \nliens or delinquent taxes was made in May 2021. (Tr. at 58) While the lien may have been \nin the process of being resolved, that process stopped and was not resumed, and it is not \nyet resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a federal tax lien in the approximate amount of $35,315, filed \nagainst him in 2013. (GE 5 at 5; GE 6 at 5) While Applicant claims that the lien was for \nunpaid taxes for 2012, it appears that the lien was also for the 2010 and 2011 delinquent \ntaxes as well as any unpaid portions of his 2008 federal tax lien. According to the \naforementioned installment agreement activity for the period July 2015 \u2013 July 2016, his \nbeginning balance for 2010 was approximately $28,315, the beginning balance for 2011 \nwas approximately $12,774, and the beginning balance for 2012 was $84, totaling for \nthose three years $41,173. Applicant\u2019s total payments for those three years was only $84. \n(Installment Agreement Activity, undated, attached to GE 7) He also referred to the \ninstallment agreement with the IRS under which he was making monthly payments of \n$1,920, and that he overpaid his 2020 taxes by $20,000 to be applied to any outstanding \nliens or delinquent taxes. (Answer to the SOR) Other than one IRS-verified scheduled \npayment of $1,920 to be made on January 25, 2021, to be applied to his 2010 tax, he \noffered no documentation to verify or support his claim. (IRS Processed Payments, \nundated, attached to Answer to the SOR; AE M) Applicant admitted that his last payment \nfor any of his tax liens or delinquent taxes was made in May 2021.

(Account Transcript, dated January 29, 2020, attached to GE 3 \nat 17) He referred to the same installment agreement with the IRS under which he claimed \nhe was making monthly payments of $1,920, and that he overpaid his 2020 taxes by \n$20,000 to be applied to any outstanding liens. (Answer to the SOR) It should be noted \nthat Applicant was scheduled to make the $1,920 payment on January 25, 2021, but the \nIRS was actually unable to process that payment.

In the absence of such verified information, I \nam unable to determine if he has any monthly remainder available for savings or \nspending. There is no evidence of any financial counseling.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n(f) failure to . . . pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR alleged two federal tax liens, one state tax lien, and seven still-delinquent \naccounts totaling approximately $198,373. In August 2017, Applicant acknowledged two \ntax liens that were filed against him in 2006 and 2007 because he owed more taxes than \nhe had expected. According to his installment agreement activity for the period July 2015 \n\u2013 July 2016, his beginning balance for those combined liens was approximately $50,639. \nContrary to his claims, there were numerous delinquent tax accounts.  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDuring the seven-year period in issue between 2010 through 2018, Applicant\u2019s \nadjusted gross income was reported to be between $115,567 and $219,325, with six of \nthose years reported to be in excess than $120,000. He claims that his current annual \nsalary is $103,000. He also earns an unspecified income for performing consulting \nservices 30 hours per week for another company. With the exception of some verified \nrelatively minor payments over the early years, and several modest payments made after \nthe SOR was issued, Applicant\u2019s focus on resolving his delinquent tax situation before \nthe SOR was issued is essentially missing. He repeatedly referred to an installment \nagreement with the IRS under which he was making monthly payments of $1,920, and \nthat he overpaid his 2020 taxes by $20,000 to be applied to any outstanding liens or \ndelinquent taxes. Other than the one IRS-verified scheduled payment of $1,920 to be \nmade on January 25, 2021, he offered no documentation to verify or support his claim. In \nfact, that scheduled $1,920 payment on January 25, 2021, was not made because the \nIRS was actually unable to process that payment. There was no verified proof of any such \npayments. Applicant admitted that his last payment for any of his tax liens or delinquent \ntaxes was made in May 2021, but there is verified evidence that he also made one small \npayment of approximately $26 on September 29, 2021, to be applied to his delinquent \n2017 tax. The state tax lien was resolved before the SOR was issued. His income \ninformation and payment history raise questions as to both an inability to pay or an \nunwillingness to pay, and Applicant failed to fully address those issues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto . . . pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. On several occasions, Applicant entered \ninto installment agreements with the IRS, but payments under those agreements were \nperiodic at best and there was essentially no compliance with those arrangements. The \nreceipt of the SOR appears to have generated some interest on his part to start to \naddressing his delinquent tax issues. Although he repeatedly stated that he would \naddress his federal tax liens and delinquent taxes over multiple-year period, there has \nbeen no consistency in his efforts, and with one small exception, they ceased in May 2021 \n\u2013 one year ago. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored his delinquent \ntaxes for a substantial multi-year period, preferring instead to give funds to family \nmembers for their education. Because of his failure to furnish more complete \ndocumentation regarding federal tax liens and delinquent federal taxes, the overwhelming \nevidence leads to the conclusion that his financial problems are not under control or that \nhe is not truly interested in resolving them. Other than his limited payment activities, he \nhas not acted responsibly by failing to more aggressively address his federal tax liens \nand delinquent taxes. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to furnish sufficient verifiable evidence that he actually began making \nsuch efforts before the SOR was issued in December 2020 \u2013 approximately one and one-\nhalf years ago. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered specific \nstatements regarding alleged payments, several of which were either unverified or proven \nto be false. \nThe nature, frequency, and continued recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, \nand his general failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them until after the SOR \nwas issued, is sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. The \ntimeliness and randomness of his efforts to resolve his delinquent federal tax debts is not \ngood, and the delay in commencing to do so, is another negative factor. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. Applicant\u2019s relative in\u00ad\naction, under the circumstances, casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsenior ETL developer with his current employer since about January 2022. He was \npreviously employed by other employers in somewhat similar positions or as a business \nintelligence architect, architect, or project manager. He was also self-employed from \nSeptember 2001 until December 2012, and from September 2013 until June 2016. He is \na 1982 high school graduate, and he took some coursework online, but has not earned \nany degree. He was granted a security clearance in 2007 and 2016, and found eligible \nfor a position of public trust in 2017. He has given financial assistance to family members \nseeking to obtain college degrees, and he is highly thought of by friends and colleagues. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant\u2019s federal tax liens and most of his delinquent federal \ntaxes remain unresolved despite his claimed efforts to resolve them. He contended that \nhe entered into installment agreements with the IRS under which he was making specific \nmonthly payments, but the only verified evidence presented was for the period October \n2016 through June 2017 reflecting periodic payments for the tax years 2006 and 2007.  \nHe referred to another installment agreement with the IRS under which he claimed he \nwas making monthly payments of $1,920, and that he overpaid his 2020 taxes by $20,000 \nto be applied to any outstanding liens. But, the IRS was actually unable to process that \npayment, and Applicant failed to produce any verified documentation that the initial \npayments had been made in January 2021 or thereafter. While periodic and inconsistent \npayments have been made over various periods, those payments generally do not appear \nto be systematic or routinely scheduled. He failed to produce any IRS-verified \ndocumentation that his federal tax liens had been released. Although he repeatedly stated \nthat he would address his delinquent tax issues over the past few years, as recently as \nMarch 2022, he claimed that his new pay-off goal is three and one-half years away.  \nThe overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are not under control. He has not acted responsibly by failing to more timely \nand aggressively address his federal tax liens and delinquent federal taxes. There are \nlingering questions if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen, as well as continuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nWith the exception of his limited, delayed, periodic, and haphazard payment \nactivities under various installment agreements, Applicant\u2019s track record of minimal \nverifiable efforts to resolve the federal tax issues is negative and disappointing. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h. through 1.j.:  \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(HE 3) On April 1, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. \nOn November 19, 2021, the case was assigned to me. On January 10, 2022, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling the hearing for \nJanuary 28, 2022. (HE 1) \nDepartment Counsel provided two exhibits, and Applicant provided one 32-page \nexhibit. (Transcript (Tr.) 16-17; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-GE 2; Applicant Exhibit (AE \nA)) There were no objections and all exhibits were admitted into evidence. The transcript \nwas received on February 4, 2022. \nLegal Issues \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice concerning \u201cIsrael: West \nBank and Gaza.\u201d (Tr. 17-19; HE 4) Applicant clarified that he did not have anything to do \nwith the Gaza Strip or groups such as Hamas; however, he did not otherwise object to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s \nmotion, subject to Applicant\u2019s clarifications. (Tr. 17-19) Parts of the request are quoted \nwithout attribution in the West Bank, Palestine section, infra. In this decision, \u201cPalestine\u201d \nin this decision means the \u201cWest Bank of Palestine,\u201d unless otherwise stated. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd.

Usually, administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts \nthat are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, \nSection 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

(HE 2) SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Palestine. (Id.) \nApplicant was born in Palestine, and he lived there through high school. (Tr. 35; \nAE A at 1) In July 2005, his father passed away, and in September 2005, he moved to \nthe United States. (Tr. 32, 35; AE A at 3, 24) In 2014, he became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 35) \nHe maintained his Palestinian citizenship and retained a Palestinian passport. (Tr. 35; AE \nA at 8) His Palestinian passport makes it easier for him to visit his mother in Palestine. \n(Tr. 36) \nApplicant communicates with his mother on a daily basis. (Tr. 45; SOR response) \nHe communicates with his mother-in-law about monthly. (Tr. 46) His mother-in-law is a \npermanent resident of the United States; however, she is currently in Palestine. (Tr. 46) \nHis spouse became a U.S. citizen in 2021. (Tr. 63; AE A at 12) His spouse communicates \nwith her mother about twice a week. (Tr. 61) His father-in-law has passed away. (Tr. 61) \nApplicant\u2019s brother does construction work in Israel, and he travels from the West \nBank to Israel for work. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant communicates with his brother in Palestine \nabout twice a week. (Tr. 44) Applicant\u2019s other brother lives in the United States with his \nspouse and children. (Tr. 41; AE A at 14) \nFive of Applicant\u2019s six sisters live in Palestine, and one sister lives in Israel. (Tr. \n47-48) One of his five sisters is likely to move to the United States to live with her fianc\u00e9 \nafter they are married. (Tr. 47-48) Three of his sisters live with his mother in Palestine, \nand he has frequent contact with them. (Tr. 50) He has weekly contact with his other two \nsisters who live in Palestine. (Tr. 50) None of his family members in Palestine are \ngovernment employees or serve in the military. (Tr. 50-54) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has three siblings who are citizens and residents of the United \nStates. (Tr. 46) She has one sibling who lives in Palestine with her mother. (Tr. 57) \nApplicant traveled to Palestine from the United States in 2009, 2013, 2014, 2016, \n2017, and July 2021 (24 days). (Tr. 36; AE A at 15-18) In November 2021, his spouse \nwent to Palestine for surgery because it is less expensive than in the United States. (Tr. \n44-45, 58) She is staying with Applicant\u2019s mother. (Tr. 60) She remained in Palestine after \nher surgery for medical reasons. (Tr. 45; AE A at 31) She wishes to return to the United \nStates once she is safely able to travel. (Tr. 56) She may return to the United States in \nMarch 2022.

(Tr. 34) His family in Palestine does not \ntravel to Gaza, which is a much more dangerous place than Palestine. (Tr. 57-58; HE 4) \nApplicant\u2019s bank account and home are in the United States. (Tr. 37-38, 55; AE A \nat 20) He has a limited right to property in Palestine because he and his siblings inherited \nland and a home from his father. (Tr. 38-39) \nApplicant has never been arrested, and he pays taxes to the U.S. Government. \n(Tr. 62) He votes in U.S. elections. He describes himself as a reliable and responsible \nperson. (Tr. 32-33) He said \u201c[I] love America. I love being here. I love [to] serve the Navy, \n[and] do what I do in my job. I love my job, and I never complain. It\u2019s a lot of opportunities, \na new day. It's a new challenge and really I love it.\u201d (Tr. 32) He describes himself and his \nspouse as Americans, and he plans to raise his children as Americans. (Tr. 62) He is \ncompletely loyal to the United States. (Tr. 62) He efficiently provides safety measures at \nhis workplace for employees. (Tr. 32) He has been promoted at work, received a bonus, \nand achieved some certifications. (Tr. 32-33, 43) He will have additional opportunities at \nwork if he receives a security clearance. (Tr. 32-33) \nCharacter Evidence \nEight character witnesses, including his spouse, coworkers, a neighbor, friends, \nand his supervisor, made statements supporting his access to classified information. (Tr. \n22-30; AE A at 26-30, 32) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is \ntrustworthy, reliable, professional, diligent, conscientious, loyal, intelligent, compliant with \nrules, and honest. \nWest Bank, Palestine \nThere have been no national elections in the West Bank since 2006. Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas has remained in office despite expiration of his \nterm in 2009. The Palestinian Legislative Council has not functioned since 2007. As of \nSeptember 23, 2020, the U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory for the West Bank \nwas Level 3, because of COVID-19 restrictions, terrorism, and civil unrest. Terrorists may \nattack with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets, \nshopping malls, and local government facilities. Multiple terrorist organizations have a \npresence in the West Bank. These groups often express anti-U.S. sentiments. The PA \nengages in numerous human rights violations. The PA has taken some steps to address \nabuses and impunity. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;   \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant has the following Palestine family connections alleged in the SOR: his \nmother, brother, six sisters, and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of Palestine; and\nhis spouse was a citizen of Palestine as of the date the SOR was issued. She became a\nU.S. citizen in 2021.     \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s six sisters moved to Israel, and she is not subject to the same \nrisks from terrorists as the rest of his family living in Palestine. Applicant has frequent \ncontacts with his relatives in Palestine. There is no evidence that any of his family \nmembers have any connection to Gaza or that his family is involved with terrorists. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with people living in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.

The nature and strength of the familial ties \nand the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood \nof vulnerability to coercion. \u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved and the \nintelligence-gathering history of that government are among the important considerations \nthat provide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the \nJudge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights record is another \nimportant consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (App. Bd. May 15, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). Another important consideration \nis the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with the United States. These factors \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that \ncountry are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement.  \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Palestine \nwith the United States and the situations involving terrorists and insurgents in that country \nplace a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith any family member living in Palestine or visiting Palestine does not pose a security \nrisk because of the risks due to terrorist activities in that country. Applicant should not be \nplaced into a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United \nStates and concerns about assisting someone living in or visiting Palestine. \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 \nn. 18 (App. Bd. July 28, 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family\nmembers in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on\ntheir prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is whether an\napplicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members in a foreign\ncountry raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a\npotential vulnerability that a foreign power, [criminals, or terrorists] could\nseek to exploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified\ninformation that an applicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family\nmembers -- has by virtue of a security clearance. A person may be\nvulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, the person\u2019s\nimmediate family members -- regardless of whether the person\u2019s family\nmembers are prominent or not. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, \n2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nor in Palestine seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant, his family, or contacts, nevertheless, this future possibility continues to warrant \nconcern. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Palestine has a significant problem \nwith terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in that country \u201ccould be a means through \nwhich Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology \nand who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)). \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with people who are living in Palestine or visiting \nPalestine create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on \nhis family living in that country in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified \ninformation. Those relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced \nsubstantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with people living in Palestine and has \nraised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation.

He has \nfrequent contacts with those relatives. His contacts with them increase the risk that they \ncould be targeted to put pressure on Applicant to provide classified information. \nThe Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or three months \nconstitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8.

The non-SOR information discussed \nin this paragraph will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.  \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d His relationship with the United States must be \nweighed against the potential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives \nwho are citizens and residents of Palestine. Applicant has lived in the United States since \n2005, except when he was visiting Palestine. In 2014, he became a U.S. citizen, and in \n2021, his spouse became a U.S. citizen. He has a U.S. passport. He owns a residence \nin the United States. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in the United States and was \nawarded multiple certifications. He votes in U.S. elections, and he pays U.S. taxes. He \nhas a U.S. bank account. He has had DOD-related employment since 2019. \nThese factors are balanced against his relationships with family in Palestine, and \nhis relatives in Palestine are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations \nof the Palestinian government. Applicant\u2019s access to classified information could add risk \nto his relatives living in Palestine. There is no allegation that he would choose to help the \nPalestinian Government or terrorists against the interests of the United States. A guideline \nB adjudication is not a judgment on an applicant\u2019s character or loyalty to the United States. \nIt is a determination as to whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances foreseeably present a \nsecurity risk. See ISCR Case No. 19-00831 at 5 (App. Bd. July 29, 2020). The concern \nhere pertains to the risk to his relatives living in Palestine and does not relate to his loyalty \nor patriotism to the United States. \nApplicant has not rebutted the concern arising from his relationships with family in \nPalestine. His frequent communications with them and travel to Palestine are factors \nindicating his care and concern for their welfare and his affection for them. His \nconnections to the United States, taken together, are insufficient to overcome the foreign \ninfluence security concerns under Guideline B. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old U.S. citizen who seeks a security clearance. He has \nbeen working for a DOD contractor in support of the Navy as a mechanical engineer since \nMarch of 2019. In August 2016, he was engaged, and in 2017, he married. His spouse is \npregnant and expecting twins. In 2018, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree at a U.S. \nuniversity where he majored in mechanical engineering. He has earned multiple \ncertifications and plans to obtain a master\u2019s degree. \nApplicant has important connections to the United States as discussed under \nGuideline B. His U.S. citizenship in 2014, and his spouse\u2019s U.S. citizenship are the most \nimportant connections to the United States. He has made a strong commitment to his life \nand future in the United States. Eight character witnesses, including his spouse, \ncoworkers, a neighbor, friends, and his supervisor, made statements supporting his \naccess to classified information. The general sense of their statements is that Applicant \nis trustworthy, reliable, professional, diligent, conscientious, loyal, intelligent, compliant \nwith rules, and honest. \nThe reasons for denying Applicant\u2019s security clearance are more persuasive. A \nGuideline B decision concerning Palestine must take into consideration the geopolitical \nsituation and dangers in that country. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May \n23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical situation and \nsuggesting expansion of whole-person discussion); ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing grant of security clearance because of terrorist activity in the \nWest Bank). Palestine is a dangerous place because of violence from terrorists, and the \nPalestine government does not respect the full spectrum of human rights. Palestine \ncontinues to be a very dangerous and unstable country.

His spouse was in Palestine for surgery and \nmedical reasons at the time of his hearing. Applicant frequently communicates with his \nspouse, mother, and five siblings living in Palestine, which demonstrates his concern for \ntheir welfare. Concern for and loyalty to relatives is a positive character trait. Applicant \ndid not meet his burden of showing that his relatives in Palestine are unlikely to come to \nthe attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. classified information. \u201cApplication of \nthe guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an \nacknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that \ncould be important to a loved one, such as a family member.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-01979 \nat 5 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate \nforeign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.f. He did not provide any explanation addressing the SOR allegations, or documentary evidence along with his Answer. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. He has been employed as a program manager by a defense contractor since 2019. This is his first application for a security clearance. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005, and a law degree and an MBA in 2016. He has been steadily employed since 2000, and was working full time while he was attending school. (Item 2) In his background interview, Applicant stated that some of his debts became delinquent in 2017 because he was helping his mother pay her mortgage and bills, approximately $800 - $1000 a month. His father had passed away three years prior, in about 2014. He prioritized helping her with her finances over his own debt payments. He asserted that he is still paying $400 - $500 monthly for his mother\u2019s expenses.

Item 2 is his 2020 SCA. Item 3 is a summary of his April 2020 interview with \na government investigator. Item 4 is a February 2020 credit report. Items 2 \u2013 4 are \nadmitted without objection \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 \n1.f. He did not provide any explanation addressing the SOR allegations, or documentary \nevidence along with his Answer. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He has been employed as a program manager by a \ndefense contractor since 2019. This is his first application for a security clearance. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005, and a law degree and an MBA in 2016. He has \nbeen steadily employed since 2000, and was working full time while he was attending \nschool. (Item 2) \nIn his background interview, Applicant stated that some of his debts became \ndelinquent in 2017 because he was helping his mother pay her mortgage and bills, \napproximately $800 - $1000 a month. His father had passed away three years prior, in \nabout 2014. He prioritized helping her with her finances over his own debt payments. \nHe asserted that he is still paying $400 - $500 monthly for his mother\u2019s expenses. He \nalso cited the high cost of living, inflation, and his lack of pay raises and cost of living \nadjustments as other reasons for his financial troubles. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts, totaling approximately $38,000. Five of \nthese debts are charged off, and one is in collection status. The allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the 2020 credit report. Applicant did not \nprovide any documentation to show the current status of the SOR debts. (Items 1, 2, 3, \n4) The status of the debts follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an education loan that is in collection in the amount of $17,160. The \ndate of last activity on the account was January 2017. As noted above, Applicant stated \nin his background interview that that he prioritized other expenses and helping his \nmother, over this debt. He hopes to make payment arrangements when he has a better \npaying job. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a student-loan debt that was charged off in January 2018, in the \namount of $11,032. Applicant stated in his background interview that he called the \ncreditor to reestablish payments, and that he has been paying $110 monthly. However, \nhe provided no substantiating documentation.

He claimed that he contacted the creditor in \n2020 after receiving a notice in the mail about the debt.

He claimed that he called the creditor in 2020 after receiving a notice about \nthe debt in the mail. He was waiting on the creditor to send him a payment plan, and \nintends to start making payments on this debt. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a credit card that was charged off in August 2019, in the amount of \n$1,421. In his background interview, he said the debt was due to helping his mother, \nincreased expenses due to inflation, and not receiving a pay raise. He claimed that he \ncalled the creditor after receiving a notice about this debt in late 2019. He was waiting \non the creditor to send him a payment plan, and intends to start making payments on \nthis debt. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4) \nSince he did not provide any documentation with his Answer, and did not \nrespond to the FORM, Applicant did not provide any documentary evidence showing \nthat any of his debts have been or are being paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. He \nalso submitted no documentation concerning his current financial situation, such as his \nmonthly income and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided \nno evidence of credit counseling. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit report in the record, and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should \napply. He did not provide any documentation that any of his debts have been or are \nbeing paid, or otherwise resolved. He provided no documentation of his current financial \nsituation, evidence which might establish his ability to address his debts responsibly. \nHis debts are recent, not isolated, and are unresolved. They continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant is given consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b). Assisting his mother with her \nfinances, after his father died, had an impact on his finances. While he started helping \nhis mother in 2017, the record shows that some of debts became charged off more than \ntwo years later. The record shows that his debts are unresolved, and he did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that he undertook responsible action to address them. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he has undertaken \ngood-faith efforts to address his debts. He gave insufficient evidence that any of his \ndebts have been or are being paid, and provided no documentation of any payments \ntowards them. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will \nnot recur, or that these debts will be resolved within a reasonable period. Some of \nApplicant\u2019s debts have been delinquent for over five years. He did not provide \ndocumentation showing that he made reasonable efforts to resolve them. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances, or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nSince Applicant did not request a hearing, I did not have the opportunity to \nquestion him about his financial issues, or to assess his credibility by observing his \ndemeanor. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts under Guideline F. My decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security \nclearance in the future. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 27 years old and has never married. He received a certificate of high school equivalency in 2013. He has also taken some college courses, but has not yet earned a degree. He has worked for a defense contractor as a mechanic since January 2018. He also became a Marine Reservist in April 2015. He was previously granted eligibility for access to classified information in connection with his Reservist duties. He seeks to retain his national security eligibility. (Item 3 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 15, and 17.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR alleged that Applicant has eight debts that are past due, charged-off, or in collection, in the total amount of approximately $30,000. The existence and amount of these debts is 2 supported by his admissions to all of the SOR allegations in his Answer and by the credit reports in the record, dated February 1, 2019 and March 3, 2020.

On July 23, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency, Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \neffective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on July 30, 2021, and requested \nhis case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. In his Answer he admitted \nall the allegations in the SOR, but also stated that the alleged debts have been fully paid \nwith the exception of one debt (SOR 1.a) that was being paid through an involuntary \ngarnishment. On December 20, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), with five documents \nattached thereto and identified as Items 1 through 5, was provided to Applicant, who \nreceived the file on February 25, 2022. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to raise objections to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. On \nMarch 27, 2022, Applicant submitted his response with five documents attached. The \ncase was assigned to me on April 12, 2022. I marked Applicant\u2019s documents as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through E. I note that AE D and E are duplicates of AE B and C. Neither \nparty objected to documents offered by the other, and all exhibits are admitted into the \nrecord. \nOn April 26, 2022, I reopened the record to give both parties the opportunity to \nprovide additional documentation and clarifications due to the state of the record. \nDepartment Counsel responded to my email the next day and provided a credit report for \nApplicant, dated April 27, 2022. Her exhibit is marked as Item 6 and is admitted without \nobjection. Applicant did not provide any additional information or documents. My email to \nApplicant and Department Counsel and the subsequent correspondence ending with \nApplicant\u2019s email dated April 27, 2022, which evidences his receipt of my earlier email \nand Department Counsel\u2019s submission, are included in the record as Admin Exhibit I. The \nrecord closed on May 4, 2022. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, \nnational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 27 years old and has never married. He received a certificate of high \nschool equivalency in 2013. He has also taken some college courses, but has not yet \nearned a degree. He has worked for a defense contractor as a mechanic since January \n2018. He also became a Marine Reservist in April 2015. He was previously granted \neligibility for access to classified information in connection with his Reservist duties. He \nseeks to retain his national security eligibility. (Item 3 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 15, and 17.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security \nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nalleged that Applicant has eight debts that are past due, charged-off, or in collection, in \nthe total amount of approximately $30,000.

(Item 3 at Section 26, \nand Items 4 and 5.) \nApplicant claimed in his Answer that he enrolled his debts in a debt consolidation \nplan (the Plan) in November 2019. The only evidence he provided supporting that \nassertion are two exhibits (AE B and C) listing credits and debits in an account during the \nperiod November 27, 2019, to October 30, 2020, and from November 2, 2020, to May 5, \n2021. These records reflect the payments to creditors listed in two of the SOR allegations \n(SOR 1.d and 1.e). Without any explanation, he identified a debt-consolidation company \nin his Answer that is different than the name of the company listed on AE B and C. \nBelow is a brief description of each debt and its current status: \n1.a. In his Answer, Applicant admitted owing a past-due loan account in collection \nin the amount of approximately $7,774. He wrote that the amount was being involuntarily \npaid through a wage garnishment. As a result of the garnishment, he represented that it \ncould not be included in the Plan. Neither the Government\u2019s February 2019 credit report \nnor its March 2020 credit report reflects that this debt is subject to a wage garnishment. \nThe debt is not listed in Applicant\u2019s March 2022 credit report (AE A) or in the \nGovernment\u2019s April 2022 report (Item 6). Applicant provided no documentation to support \nhis claim that this debt was being paid by the garnishment of his wages. He also provided \nno information regarding the current status of this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Answer \nat 1; Item 4 at 1; Item 5 at 5.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing a charged-off account to an auto finance company \nin the amount of approximately $7,404. Item 6 and AE A reflect that this debt has been \npaid. This debt has been resolved. (Answer at 1; Item 6 at 6; AE A at 7.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing a past-due, credit-card debt in the amount of \napproximately $4,970. Item 6 and AE A reflect that this debt has been paid. This debt has \nbeen resolved. (Answer at 1; Item 6 at 5; AE A at 5-6.) \n1.d. Applicant admitted owing a past-due account to a collection agency in the \namount of approximately $4,600. Neither the name of the original creditor nor the type of \naccount appears in the record. This debt does not appear in AE A or Item 6. However, \nmonthly payments of $100 to the collection agency identified in this subparagraph of the \nSOR are listed in AE B and AE C beginning on April 30, 2020, and continuing for 12 \nmonths, with additional payments of $871 on April 27, 2021, and $771 and $100 on May \n4, 2021. These payments total $2,942. Viewing the record evidence as a whole, this debt \nhas been satisfied with the partial payments to the collection agency made pursuant to \nthe Plan. This debt has been resolved. (Answer at 1; Item 4 at 2; AE B at 1-3; AE C at 1-\n2.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admitted owing a past-due debt to a collection agency in the amount \nof approximately $574. This debt does not appear in AE A or Item 6 under either the name \nof the collection agency or the original creditor. However, AE B reflects five payments to \nthis collection agency in the total amount of $298, made pursuant to the Plan between \nJanuary 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020. There is no further information in the record \nconfirming that this debt has been resolved with these payments. Viewing the record \nevidence as a whole, this debt has been satisfied with payments to the collection agency \ntotaling $298 made pursuant to the Plan. This debt is resolved. (Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 5; \nAE B at 1-2.) \n1.f. Applicant admitted owing a past-due debt to a bank, which charged off the debt \nin the approximate amount of $4,677. This debt is listed in Item 5 with an account number \nthat identifies the debt as a credit-card account. This debt does not appear in AE A or \nItem 6, nor is there evidence of any payments listed in AE B or AE C made to this creditor. \nAlthough the amount of this debt is similar to the amount of the debt listed in SOR 1.d \n($4,600), there is no information in the record, such as the name of the creditor in AE B \nor AE C or account numbers, to support a conclusion that the debt is a duplicate of the \nSOR 1.d. Also Applicant\u2019s assertion in his Answer that he has resolved all of the SOR \ndebts owed to collection agencies does not address this debt owed to a credit-card issuer. \nThe record evidence does not support a conclusion that this debt has been paid. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Item 5 at 4.) \n1.g. Applicant admitted being indebted to a communication company for a debt \nplaced in collection the amount of approximately $204. This debt does not appear in AE \nA or Item 6, nor are any payments listed in AE B or AE C to this creditor. The record \nevidence does not reflect that this debt has been paid other than Applicant\u2019s unsupported \nclaim in his Answer. This debt is not resolved. (Item 5 at 5.) \n1.h. This is a debt in collection for $594. The credit reports in the record reflect that \nit is owed to the same creditor and the same collection agency as the debt alleged in SOR \n1.e ($574). The only difference between the two debts is a disparity of $20 in the amount \nof the debts. Although Applicant has not asserted that this debt is a duplicate of the debt \nalleged in SOR 1.e, I conclude that it is. This debt is resolved. (Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 5.) \nIn his e-QIP, Applicant identified three of the creditors listed in the SOR (SOR 1.b, \n1.c, and 1.f). He wrote: \nI have no excuses for my actions, I went too long without a job in between \ncareer changes. I will use a debt consolidation program as soon as I start \nworking. (Item 3 at 32-34.) \nSection 13A of the e-QIP asks Applicant about his employment history. That \nhistory shows a gap in his employment between June 2017 and January 2018, when he \nbegan working for or was hired by his current employer. (Item 3 at 12-13.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence with his Answer. He had not begun \nto pay any of his debts at that time. In the Government\u2019s FORM, Department Counsel \nnoted: \nWith respect to the remaining debts [other than SOR debt 1.a], Applicant \navers that he has paid the debts, but has not provided any evidence of his \npayments. FORM at 2. \nAccordingly, Applicant was advised that he needed to provide documents evidencing \npayments of his debts. As noted, he also did not provide any documents with respect to \nSOR debt 1.a. In his reply to the FORM he submitted evidence of payments made to the \ncreditors listed in SOR 1.d and 1.e. He also provided AE A, a credit report that contains \nevidence of the satisfaction of the debts alleged in SOR 1.b and 1.c. AE B also lists four \npayments totaling $1,480 to a collection agency that is not identified in the SOR, and \nApplicant failed to explain if those payments were for any of the SOR debts. Otherwise, \nthe record is silent as to payments and the satisfaction of the debts listed in the SOR. \nApplicant chose to waive a hearing at which he could have fully explained his \nevidence and had the opportunity to fill in the gaps in his evidence. His testimony at a \nhearing would also have provided a basis for determining that his testimony was \nsufficiently credible to support his position in his Answer that he has satisfied all of his \ndebts. \nAlso, Applicant did not provide any documentation concerning his current income \nor assets, by which he might show his current ability to address his ongoing debts and \nhis financial stability. He also did not provide any additional evidence for consideration \nunder the whole-person concept. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe documentary evidence in the record establishes that Applicant has incurred \nabout $30,000 in past-due indebtedness over the last several years. These facts establish \nprima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by those disqualifying conditions. \nGuideline F includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAll of the above mitigating conditions have partial application, but overall, Applicant \ndid not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern raised by his \ndelinquent debts. He took actions to resolve two of his debts by establishing the Plan, \nwhich was a reasonable partial step, but his actions did not address his other debts. He \nprovided a credit report (AE A) that showed two other debts had been satisfied He \nprovided minimal evidence about the services he received from the debt-consolidation \ncompany and whether the services included financial counseling from a legitimate and \ncredible source. Further, he did not establish sufficient evidence that all of his debts are \nbeing resolved or are under control. There is insufficient mitigating evidence in the record, \nhowever, to support a conclusion that Applicant is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \ncreditors and otherwise resolve his debts. Accordingly, he continues to have past-due \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \ndebts that are ongoing and unresolved, and his behavior casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nApplicant claimed in his Answer that he has paid all of the SOR debts. He \nsubmitted minimal documentary evidence in mitigation. He did not request a hearing at \nwhich his credibility could be assessed and he could provide additional testimony \nexplaining his exhibits. I reopened the record to give Applicant the opportunity to provide \nadditional clarifying explanations or documents. He declined to offer anything further. \nApplicant asserted in his Answer that \u201cmy credit report right now shows that all \naccounts are satisfied and non-delinquent.\u201d (Answer at 1) In fact, that credit report (AE A) \nonly reflects that two of the SOR debts have been resolved (SOR 1.b and 1.c). The fact \nthat the other SOR debts do not appear on his recent credit report (AE A) or the \nGovernment\u2019s report (Item 6), however, is not sufficient evidence that any of the \nremaining SOR debts have been resolved. ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. \n15, 2015) (\u201cThe fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish \nany meaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt\u201d). Debts can be \ndropped from credit reports for reasons other than the resolution of the debts. There is no \nbasis in the record evidence for me to conclude that Applicant has resolved all of the \ndebts or intends to resolve some debts in the future pursuant to a reasonable plan and \nhas mitigated the security concerns arising from his delinquent debts. Applicant has failed \nto meet his burden to provide sufficient evidence in mitigation of the security concerns \nraised in the SOR. ISCR Case No. 14-05074 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2016.) Paragraph 1 \nis found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case and the above whole-person \nfactors. Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised by his past-due indebtedness. \nWhen I reopened the record, Applicant was given the opportunity to supplement it and \nprovide additional clarifying evidence. He declined to do so. He presented insufficient \ndocumentary evidence to confirm his assertion in his Answer that he had resolved all of \nhis collection debts.

Applicant has not mitigated the security concern raised by his \nuse of illegal drugs. Eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 3, 2020. The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 7, 2020, detailing security concerns under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

On May 20, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items1 through 11 \n(Items).

He is divorced with no children. Since 2002, he has been \nemployed by a defense contractor. (Item 3.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout 2015 to present; (2) used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2017 to \npresent while having access to classified information; (3) and intends to continue using \nmarijuana in the future.

His \nstatement is undercut by his contradictory statement denying his use of marijuana \nbetween 2015 and 2020 and his explanation that he, or someone, was confused. (Item \n5.) \nDiscussion \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nUnder AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into \ndoubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25 and 26\n(setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation; \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement . . . or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse; \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n      (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand   \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant admitted using marijuana while holding a security with the most recent \nusage being in February 2020. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to an SOR \nor in an interview require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made to the SOR allegations . \n. . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and \nn.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s admissions, whether testimonial or written, \ncan provide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge\u2019s findings\u201d).   \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated \nby the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. \nThe knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npunishable by imprisonment, a fine or both. 21U.S.C.\u00a7844. In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (f) apply here. Because of Applicant\u2019s \nrecord of prior marijuana use and his equivocation on future use, AG \u00b6 25(g) may also \napply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant used illegal drugs with \nvarying frequency as recently as February 2020. His behavior was neither infrequent, nor \ndid it occur that long ago, with his last use being in February 2020, just two years ago. I \nfind that AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant\u2019s signed written statement \ndoes track the language of AG \u00b6 and26(b). In explaining his future intent, Applicant\u2019s \ninterview was equivocal. He cites \u201cconfusion\u201d and apologizes if he caused any confusion. \nTaking the record as a whole given Applicant\u2019s recent and a frequent use of marijuana, I \nfind that his statement of intent lacks credibility. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. \nThe record raises doubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly not consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information. \nPhilip J.

(Tr. 13-14) On February 14, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. \nThree post-hearing exhibits were received; there were no objections; and the three \ndocuments were admitted into evidence. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A (Alcohol and \nSubstance Abuse Program (ASAP) completions); AE B (payments to address one debt); \nand AE C (emails showing dispute of student loan debt). The record was held open until \nMarch 28, 2022, to enable Applicant to provide documentation. (Tr. 23, 52; AE C) \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He \nalso provided extenuating and mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted \nas findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old nuclear inspector, who has worked for a defense \ncontractor for three years. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) In 2006, he received a General Educational \nDiploma (GED). (Tr. 6) He has some college credits; however, he did not receive a \ndegree. (Tr. 7) He has not served in the military and has never been married. (Tr. 7) He \ndoes not have any children. (Tr. 7) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges five student-loan debts totaling $31,425, which were placed for \ncollection as follows: \u00b6 1.a for $9,646; \u00b6 1.b for $8,801; \u00b6 1.d for $5,685; \u00b6 1.e for $5,326; \nand \u00b6 1.f for $1,967. His SOR also alleges a charged-off vehicle-related loan in \u00b6 1.c for \n$6,772 and two delinquent medical debts in \u00b6 1.g for $1,427 and \u00b6 1.h for $194. \nApplicant went to a college that was implicated in fraudulent activity. (Tr. 16) The \ncollege closed, and the credits he earned were not transferable because the college was \nnot accredited. (Tr. 45-46) He made some payments on his student loans. (Tr. 45) He \nbelieved he could be released from liability for his student loans. The Department of \nEducation (ED) holds the student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. About two \nyears ago, Applicant contacted ED and learned ED wanted him to start payments. (Tr. \n17) Applicant was trying to get a deferment until he could obtain a release from the student \nloans. (Tr. 17-21) He said his most recent credit report does not reflect his student-loan \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts. (Tr. 17-18) However, his January 31, 2020 credit report, the most recent credit \nreport of record, states the five student loans were opened in the 2011 to 2013 timeframe \nand reflects their transfer to collection status in 2017. (GE 3) The amounts in the SOR \nare the amounts the five accounts are shown as delinquent in this credit report. (GE 3) \nHe does not have any documentation showing he attempted to settle his ED debt. (Tr. \n18) \nOn February 4, 2022, the Federal Student Loan Borrower Defense Customer \nService emailed Applicant and advised him: \nWe have received your application for a borrower defense discharge of your\nfederal stu\n \ndent loans under the borrower defense to repayment rules at 34\nC.F.R. \u00a7 685.206(c) (2017). . . . We will notify you once a decision has been\nmade on your application. If your borrower defense claim is approved, we\nwill determine how much debt relief (0% -100%) to provide based on the\namount of financial harm you suffered as a result of your school\u2019s conduct.\n(AE C) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn March 25, 2022, ED emailed Applicant and gave him updated information about his \nborrower defense. (AE C) ED advised that he could provide additional information to \nassist in reconciling his claims. (Id.) In 2018, Applicant\u2019s federal income tax refund was \ndiverted to pay his student-loan debt. (GE 2) His student loans are no longer in collection \nstatus pending resolution of his claim. (AE C) \nAs for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $6,772, Applicant said he borrowed money in 2012 \nto purchase a car, and it was voluntarily repossessed. (Tr. 20) He made $100 to $150 \nmonthly payments for about five years to address this debt. (Tr. 19; AE B) He believed \nthis account was in good standing. (Tr. 19) On January 31, 2022, the creditor wrote that \nhe paid off 95 percent of the loan and now owes $1,246. (AE B) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h allege and Applicant admitted that he had delinquent medical \ndebts for $1,427 and $194. (SOR response) He had some discussions with creditors or \ncollection agents. (Tr. 22) He is considering some options on how to settle the larger \nmedical debt. (Tr. 22) He believes he paid the smaller medical debt. (Tr. 23-24) His \nJanuary 31, 2020 credit report shows both debts are in collections. (GE 3) His January \n31, 2020 credit report also shows that his non-SOR debts are paid or current. (GE 3) \nCriminal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.l alleges in about December 2006, Applicant was charged with failure to \nappear on a misdemeanor charge, and in about February 2007, he was convicted of this \ncharge. However, he did not remember the underlying misdemeanor charge. (Tr. 28; SOR \nresponse; GE 5) Under state law, failure to appear on a misdemeanor charge is itself a \nmisdemeanor. (GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 2.h alleges and Applicant admitted that in about March 2012, he was \ncharged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (Tr. 28; SOR response; GE 5; \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGE 6) In his April 29, 2019 SCA, he disclosed that he was arrested for DUI in 2012 and \nconvicted of DUI. (GE 1) He received a $500 fine and five days in jail. (GE 1; GE 2) \nAccording to the FBI record and state record, he was convicted of reckless driving in June \n2012. (GE 5; GE 6) Under state law, the first and second DUIs and reckless driving are \nmisdemeanors. \nSOR \u00b6 2.k alleges and Applicant admitted that in about July 2012, he was \ncharged with driving with a suspended license. (Tr. 28; SOR response) Under state law, \ndriving with a suspended or revoked license is a misdemeanor. \nSOR \u00b6 2.j alleges and Applicant admitted that in about August 2012, he was \ncharged with driving with an expired registration. (Tr. 28; SOR response) Under state law, \ndriving with an expired registration is a traffic infraction and not a criminal offense. \nSOR \u00b6 2.i alleges and Applicant admitted that in about October 2012, he was \ncharged with an HOV violation and with speeding. (Tr. 28; SOR response) Under state \nlaw, an HOV violation and speeding are traffic infractions and not criminal offenses. \nSOR \u00b6 2.g alleges and Applicant admitted that in about May 2013, he was charged \nwith driving while intoxicated (DWI) first offense, and in about September 2013, he was \nconvicted of DWI. (Tr. 27-28; SOR response; GE 5) In his August 8, 2019 Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) interview, Applicant said he was arrested for DWI and \nspeeding, and he received a $500 fine and two weeks in jail. (GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 2.f alleges and Applicant admitted that in about July 2013, he was charged \nwith illegally carrying a concealed weapon. (Tr. 28; SOR response) The concealed \nweapon charge was dismissed when Applicant went to court. (GE 2) Applicant admitted \nhe had a firearm in his vehicle when the police stopped his vehicle. (GE 2)  \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges and Applicant admitted that in about July 2013, he was charged \nwith DUI, and in about September 2013, he was convicted of this offense (Tr. 28; SOR \nresponse). The state record supports this DUI arrest and conviction (GE 6); however, \nApplicant said he only had one DUI in 2013. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges in about April 2014, Applicant was arrested for a capias or arrest \nwarrant for a State Alcohol Safety Action Program (SASAP) violation. In about July 2014, \nhe was convicted of violating his parole when he failed to complete the terms of his DUI \nconviction. He admitted he violated one of the SASAP rules; he turned himself in to the \npolice; and he was convicted of a parole violation. (Tr. 27; SOR response) A parole \nviolation is a misdemeanor offense. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges and Applicant admitted that in about December 2018, he was \ncharged with driving with a suspended driver\u2019s license and fail to obey highway sign. (Tr. \n26; SOR response) Under state law, driving with a suspended driver\u2019s license is a \nmisdemeanor, and fail to obey traffic sign is a traffic infraction and not a criminal offense. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges in about January 2019, Applicant was charged with driving with \na suspended license.

(Tr.\n26) He did not know why his driver\u2019s license was suspended in 2018 and 2019, and he \nsuggested he might have owed money on a ticket. (Tr. 43) Under state law, driving with\na suspended driver\u2019s license is a misdemeanor. \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges in about January 2019, Applicant was charged with texting or \nemailing while driving. He said a police officer mistakenly believed he was texting \nbecause he was holding his phone in his hand. (Tr. 25) Nevertheless, the police officer \nwrote him a ticket for texting while driving. (Tr. 25) He paid a fine for the texting ticket. \n(GE 2) Under state law, illegally using a handheld personal communications device while \ndriving is a traffic infraction and not a criminal offense. \nApplicant said he was arrested for three DUIs, with the most recent DUI being in \n2020. (Tr. 29, 42) One of the DUIs in the SOR was reduced to reckless driving. (Tr. 42) \nUnder state law, reckless driving is a misdemeanor. For the first two DUIs, his blood \nalcohol content (BAC) was .08, and for his 2020 DUI his BAC was .12. (Tr. 43) He was \nconvicted of the 2020 DUI. (Tr. 44) His driver\u2019s license is currently revoked. (Tr. 44) \nIn 2013, 2016, and 2021, Applicant successfully completed alcohol safety action \nprograms (ASAP). (Tr. 30-31, 44; AE A) He improved his handling of alcohol. (Tr. 30) He \nsaid he reduced his alcohol consumption after 2013. (Tr. 29) \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.c allege Applicant failed to disclose on his April 29, 2019 SCA \nthat he was fired in October 2017 from employment at a store for sexual harassment. \nApplicant said he touched a person he considered a friend on her shoulder, and he said \n\u201cI hope you feel better.\u201d (Tr. 32) In his August 8, 2019 OPM interview, Applicant said he \ngrabbed his coworker by the shoulders and squeezed them two or three times to show \nthat he was happy she was back at work after an illness. (GE 2) The \u201cshoulder touch\u201d \nwas caught on camera, and \u201cturned into a huge situation.\u201d (Tr. 32) He was fired for sexual \nharassment. (Tr. 32) He said he answered no to the question about being fired or \nterminated from employment because he misunderstood the question. (Tr. 36) He was \ngiven an opportunity to disclose the firing for sexual harassment during his OPM \ninterview, and he did not provide information about it until the OPM investigator \nconfronted him with information about the sexual harassment allegation. (GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b alleges Applicant failed to disclose on his April 29, 2019 SCA that he \nhad the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, supra. He said he misread the SCA \nquestion about having debts in collections, charged-off debts, repossessions, or debts \ndelinquent more than 120 days.

(GE 1) \nSOR \u00b6 3.g cross alleges the criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6 2 as a personal conduct \nsecurity concern. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant described one circumstance beyond his control, which adversely \naffected his finances. He was the victim of an unscrupulous college. However, \u201c[e]ven if \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). Applicant did not file a lawsuit against his college \nor seek reimbursement from his college before it closed.   \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Applicant \ndid not provide supporting documentary evidence that he maintained contact with the \ncreditor for his student loans. He did not provide any evidence of any payments or \nsettlement offers. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant has been employed for the previous three years. He did not prove he \nwas unable to make payments to address his SOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant did not describe any financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant has a basis to dispute his student loans. He believes the college did not \nfully disclose information to him relevant to his decision to obtain student loans. His \nstudent loans are under ED purview. He filed a dispute and ED is reviewing his claim. AG \n\u00b6 20(e) applies to his student loans. \nApplicant has paid down 95 percent of the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He currently owes \n$1,246, and he is making monthly payments to address this debt. SOR \u00b6 1.c is mitigated. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has accepted responsibility for the two medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h for \n$1,427 and $194. Based on his track record of paying his debts, I believe he will pay or \nresolve his remaining debts. There is sufficient assurance that his financial problem is \nbeing resolved. Under all the circumstances, he established mitigation of financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) \nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) \nand 31(c). Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, \ninfra. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges, and he admitted that he committed nine misdemeanor \noffenses between 2006 and 2019 in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.h, 2.k, and 2.l. The conduct \nalleged and he admitted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.i, and 2.j are traffic infractions and not criminal \noffenses. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.i, and 2.j are found for Applicant. \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant was arrested in 2020 for DUI, and his BAC \nwas .12. He was convicted of the 2020 DUI. His driver\u2019s license is currently revoked. In \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); IS\n \nCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \nAfter careful consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on criminal \noffenses, and all the facts and circumstances, I have continuing doubts about the risks \nthat Applicant will make poor decisions and show poor judgment in connection with \nsecurity and classified information. Not enough time has elapsed without criminal conduct \nto eliminate doubt about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Criminal conduct concerns are not fully mitigated.   \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose on his April 29, 2019 SCA that he had delinquent debts \nand a repossessed vehicle. He did not disclose that he was terminated from his \nemployment in October 2017 for sexual harassment. \nApplicant said he did not understand the questions on his SCA about his \ndelinquent debts and reasons for leaving employment. The financial questions and \nleaving employment questions are straight forward and easy to understand. He answered \ntwo questions on his SCA about termination of employment and accurately disclosed \nnegative information. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nApplicant knew his vehicle was repossessed, and he knew his student loans were \ndelinquent. The sexual harassment involving the \u201cshoulder touch\u201d was caught on camera, \nand \u201cturned into a huge situation.\u201d He was fired for sexual harassment. I am not convinced \nApplicant honestly answered the questions on his SCA about his termination from \nemployment in 2017 and delinquent debts. The questions about delinquent debts and \nemployment termination are clear and easy to understand. He elected not to disclose his \ndelinquent debts and termination for sexual harassment. The record evidence establishes \nAG \u00b6 16(a) in relation to SOR \u00b6 3.a and \u00b6 3.b. \nAG \u00b6 16 has three disqualifying conditions that are relevant in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) read: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of:  . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . . \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3) do not apply to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.g. As indicated \nin the previous section, Guideline J is the most appropriate guideline for Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct. The Guideline J discussion indicates sufficient evidence for an adverse \ndetermination. Personal conduct security concerns are refuted with respect to SOR \u00b6 3.g. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability. \n \nApplicant\u2019s terminations from employments for attendance-related issues and \nlosing a check are relatively minor, and have not recurred since 2015. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies \nto the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.d, 3.e, and 3.f, and they are mitigated. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his \ndelinquent debts and termination from employment in 2017 for sexual harassment on his \nApril 29, 2019 SCA, and the underlying sexual harassment, which was the basis of his \ntermination. His false statements on his SCA and his sexual harassment in 2017 continue \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old nuclear inspector, who has worked for a defense \ncontractor for three years. In 2006, he received a GED. He has some college credits; \nhowever, he did not receive a degree. There is no evidence of employment problems at \nhis current employment. \nThe factors weighing against granting his security clearance are more substantial \nthan the mitigating circumstances. Applicant committed 10 misdemeanor-level criminal \noffenses from 2006 to 2020, including three alcohol-related driving offenses. He violated \nparole, drove with a suspended license, and possessed a concealed firearm in his \nvehicle. He failed to disclose his delinquent debts and termination from employment for \nsexual harassment in 2017 on his April 29, 2019 SCA. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more time without criminal conduct and other conduct raising a serious concern, he \nmay well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance \nworthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person.

He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c (owing $360,000 to the Small Business Administration (B) on a delinquent account). His SOR admission and those at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 65 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1977 and served over 22 years on active duty until he was honorably retired in January 2000. His service included assignments to the Special Forces for 10 years, followed by assignments to signal and intelligence commands. Since he retired, Applicant has been working for federal contractors providing radio and communications support to several highly sensitive Government agencies. He has held eligibility for a clearance since 1978, sometimes at the top-secret or higher levels. There is no evidence of any other security concerns, except for those alleged in the SOR.

He has acquired no delinquencies since 2018. He was \ncandid and forthcoming during the clearance process. He is in control of his finances and \nhas the means to maintain his financial responsibility. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on May \n8, 2018. He was interviewed by a government investigator on November 13, 2019, and \nanswered a set of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) interrogatories \non December 21, 2020. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued him an SOR on March 9, 2021, alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on \nMay 4, 2021, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe case was assigned to me on August 30, 2021. The scheduling of the hearing \nwas delayed because of COVID-19 pandemic health and safety concerns, and the \nunavailability of a viable video teleconference system (VTC). On February 1, 2022, DOHA \nissued a notice for a hearing via the Microsoft Teams VTC application setting the hearing \nfor February 2, 2022. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government offered five exhibits (GE 1 \nthrough 5). Applicant submitted 19 exhibits (AE), marked AE 1 through 19. AE 19 was \nsubmitted post-hearing. It is comprised of five tabs marked A through E. All exhibits were \nmade part of the record and admitted without objection, except for AE 16, which is not \nsubstantive evidence. Applicant testified as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received \nby DOHA on February 8, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nSOR \u00b6 1.c mistakenly alleged that Applicant owed $36,000 on a delinquent \naccount. Applicant clarified in his answer to the DOHA interrogatories and at his hearing \nthat the amount he owed was $360,000. To conform the SOR allegation with the evidence \npresented, I sua sponte amended SOR \u00b6 1.c to read $360,000. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the financial allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n(owing a creditor $154,615 for a loan in collection), and 1.b (owing a bank $10,392 for an \naccount in collection). He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c (owing $360,000 to the Small Business \nAdministration (B) on a delinquent account). His SOR admission and those at his hearing \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, \nI make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 65 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1977 and served over 22 \nyears on active duty until he was honorably retired in January 2000. His service included \nassignments to the Special Forces for 10 years, followed by assignments to signal and \nintelligence commands. Since he retired, Applicant has been working for federal \ncontractors providing radio and communications support to several highly sensitive \nGovernment agencies. He has held eligibility for a clearance since 1978, sometimes at \nthe top-secret or higher levels. There is no evidence of any other security concerns, \nexcept for those alleged in the SOR. He married his wife of 40 years in 1982, and has \none adult daughter. \nSometime before 2015, Applicant\u2019s late brother (D), asked him for financial \nassistance to purchase a supermarket franchise (store). D was the general manager for \na supermarket in the state where he and Applicant were born and raised. D proposed that \nhe would manage the store\u2019s daily business because of his expertise, and Applicant \nwould be a silent investor-partner. Applicant lacked the expertise to manage a store, and \nhe had a full-time job and lived in another state. Applicant agreed. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and D purchased the store franchise for about $1 million. They came up \nwith about $500,000 from their savings and retirement accounts. For the remainder of the \nprice, D and Applicant took out a $643,00 Small Business Administration loan from the \ncreditor alleged in SOR 1.c (B). Applicant became the majority stake holder in the \nbusiness with 51 percent ownership, and his brother was the minority stake holder with a \n49 percent ownership. They incorporated their business, and the supermarket opened for \nbusiness around October 2015. (Tr. 47-51) \nThe store did well for the first two years, making about $2 million in 2016, and \nabout $3 million in 2017. Applicant testified the income was reinvested into the store, and \nused to pay employees and operational expenses. (Tr. 51-52) Applicant reported the \nbusiness increased earnings to his employer and supervisors to avoid any security \nissues. He purchased a luxury car and a sports car in 2016-2017. As of January 2022, he \nowed $19,293 on the luxury car loan, and $21,298 on the sports car loan. Both accounts \nare current and in good standing. (AE 2; See AE 19.a) \nIn late 2017, D had several strokes and was hospitalized. Thereafter, he was \nunable to manage the store and an assistant manager was appointed. Applicant believes \nthat the assistant manager did not pay the incoming bills and misappropriated the store\u2019s \nmoney. He did not file charges or a claim against the assistant store manager. \nIn about June 2018, Applicant received letters from the store\u2019s landlord and a \ncreditor indicating that a loan and the lease were delinquent. Applicant testified he \ncontacted the creditors and explained to them that his brother was in the hospital. He then \ntried to make things right. He called the store twice a week trying to assess the situation \nand provided whatever help he could to manage the store. \nWhen the store was failing, Applicant took out two personal loans trying to keep \nthe store functioning. He borrowed $150,000 from the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and a \n$50,000 loan from EFG (a financial group not alleged in the SOR). The money from both \nloans was supposed to be used to pay employee wages and store expenses; however, \naccording to Applicant the store manager did not pay the bills and $20,000 of money in \nreserve disappeared. Applicant closed the store mid-2018. (Tr. 53-55) \nWhile the store was in business, it was repaying both of Applicant\u2019s personal loans. \nAbout $30,000 of the $50,000 loan was paid before the store closed. For the remaining \nbalance, Applicant negotiated a $500 monthly payment plan with EBF. Between \nNovember 2019 and March 2021, Applicant made 17 payments for a total of $8,500. (AE \n13) As of February 2022, Applicant owed only $5,040. (AE 13, 14) At his hearing, he \nanticipated paying the remainder of the debt in October 2022. He then intends to apply \nthe payment to other debts.  \n \nApplicant believes that the store payments reduced the $150,000 loan alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, to about $90,000 by the time the store closed. He testified that in late-2018 \nearly-2019, he attempted to establish a repayment plan with the creditor alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a, similar to the one he established with EBF, but the creditor refused.

After \nthe store closed in late 2018, Applicant made no more payments to the creditor alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. The creditor has not contacted Applicant requesting repayment of the loan \nsince the store closed in late-2018, and it has not filed for collection or obtained a \njudgment against Applicant. (Tr. 56-57) \nApplicant testified that when the store closed, it had paid about $343,000 of the \n$643,000 SBC loan he and his late brother took out from B, and it owed about $300,000. \nApplicant believes that the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c has been satisfied, because \nwhen the store closed, B took possession of all the merchandise and equipment inside of \nthe store to offset the store\u2019s debt. After B took the store\u2019s merchandise and property, \nApplicant did not make any further payments on the account, and he said the creditor \nnever sought any additional payments. According to Applicant, the creditor did not attempt \nany further collection, and it has not filed for collection or obtained a judgment against \nhim. The creditor did not initiate a recovery action against the estate of Applicant\u2019s brother. \nApplicant does not know the status of the account or whether he owes any money. (Tr. \n37, 55-56, 59) \nThe store owed about $100,000 in rent to the landlord when it closed. Applicant \ntestified that the landlord waived collecting the past-due rent because another company \nwanted to lease Applicant\u2019s store. (Tr. 37) Applicant believes that the other company \nassumed his lease. (Tr. 55) Applicant consulted with attorneys and has considered filing \nfor bankruptcy, but so far has decided against it. He notified the federal agency he was \nworking for about the possibility of having to file for bankruptcy because the business was \nfailing. (Tr. 37, AE 12) \nApplicant opened the credit card account with the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b to \npay for store expenses trying to keep it open. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleged one account (ending in \n0279) in collection for $10,392. Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows that he settled \nthe account for $4,157 in March 2021, and paid it off in twelve monthly payments of about \n$346 between March 2021 and February 2022. SOR \u00b6 1.b is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n(AE 1, 15, and 19.c) \nApplicant also opened two lines of credit accounts with the same creditor to pay \nfor store necessities. As of January 2022, both line of credit accounts had a balance of \nabout $19,000 each. (See AE 5, 6) As of the hearing day, both accounts were current \nand were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 44-46, AE 2) In addition to the accounts previously \nmentioned, as of January 31, 2022, Applicant was making monthly payments on the \nfollowing accounts: 1) a mortgage payment of $1,992, on a $316,161 mortgage. The \nhome has an estimated value of $609,800. (AE 3, 4); 2) a credit card owing $17,292 (See \nAE 7 and AE 19.b); 3) a charge card owing $2,759; 4) a charge card owing $4,873; 5) a \ncharge card owing $8,106; 6) an unsecured loan owing $433; and 7) an unsecure loan \nowing $3,145. (See AE 2) \nAs of the time of his hearing, Applicant\u2019s annual gross salary was about $123,000. \nAdditionally, he earned about $8,400 a year from two part-time jobs; $26,400 a year from \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nhis military retirement; about $36,000 a year from his service-related disability retirement; \nand $9,600 a year from a company\u2019s retirement, for a total annual income of over \n$203,400. Applicant believes that he is currently financially stable. His income allows him \nto pay his living expenses and his debts, except for the two debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.c. He intends to retire in 2023. He believes that his retired income will allow him to \ncontinue paying his debts. (See AE 17, 18) If the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c \nfile collection actions against him, Applicant will try to make payment arrangements with \nthem. If they refuse to make payment arrangements, he believes that he may be forced \nto file for bankruptcy. \nApplicant has not participated in financial counseling recently. However, he noted \nhe has consulted with attorneys about the possibility of filing for bankruptcy. \nNotwithstanding, his documentary evidence is sufficient to show he is following a budget \nand paying his debts, except for the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. I note that \nhe has not acquired any additional delinquent debts since 2018. \nApplicant submitted three reference letters, including two from direct government \nsupervisors and his federal contractor manager. Applicant has been working with a \nsensitive federal agency since 2013. He has been entrusted with sensitive and classified \ninformation for several programs. He is considered to be a man of high character and \nintegrity. Both supervisors trust him with classified and national security information and \nwould welcome him back to work with the agency. (AE 8) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by his failed business. He has learned \na hard lesson as a result of his financial problems and the clearance process. He \nunderstands that he has to maintain financial responsibility to be eligible for a clearance \nand to retain his job. He promised to maintain financial responsibility. He noted that he \nhas increased his credit score to 717. He believes this demonstrates his improved \nfinancial responsibility. (AE 19.e) His financial problems were caused by circumstances \nbeyond his control and are unlikely to recur in the future. He believes that his military \nservice, along with his many years working sensitive positions for federal agencies, show \nthat he will not be a security risk. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528\n(1988). \n \n \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He had two \noutstanding collection accounts and a delinquent account, totaling over $500,000. AG \u00b6 \n19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 19(a) is partially applicable because Applicant acquired the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR between 2015 and 2018, and he has not acquired any additional \ndelinquent debts after 2018. However, he just settled and paid one account alleged in the \nSOR, and he still has two unresolved accounts in collection that he failed to pay. Thus, \nthe financial problems are recent. \nAG \u00b6 19(b) is supported by the facts in this case and it is fully applicable because \nApplicant\u2019s financial problem were caused or aggravated largely by circumstances \nbeyond his control, e.g., his brother\u2019s illness and death, a failed business, and the larceny \nof the store\u2019s funds. I have carefully considered whether Applicant was financially \nresponsible and determined that in light of the evidence as a whole, he has been \nfinancially responsible. \nApplicant and his brother used most of their savings and retirement accounts to \npurchase the store franchise and start their business. D was a manager in a similar store \nand he knew the business and how to run the store\u2019s daily business. During the first two \nyears the store was profitable, making about $5 million. After his brother became sick and \nunable to manage the store, the store started to get into financial trouble likely because \nof the lack of management and close supervision. Applicant lived far away in another \nstate, had his own full-time employment, and did not have the expertise to manage the \nstore. He tried to prop up the store by taking personal loans to pay the employees and \nthe store bills. After his brother died and the store closed, he was left with debt that he \nwas personally liable for as well as the store and likely part of his late brother\u2019s share. \nThe record shows that Applicant attempted to negotiate with his creditors and \nestablished payment plans with those creditors willing to negotiate and receive monthly \npayments. Some of those accounts were current, and as such, not alleged in the SOR. \n(See AE 2) \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant overextended himself financially in his effort to salvage the store. He also \npurchased a couple of luxury cars when the store was doing well in 2015-2016. He \nacquired a lot of debt as indicated in AE 2. However, he is currently paying 15 debts and \nhis financial obligations are current, except for the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.c (See AE 2, 3, 5 -7, 13 - 15, 17, 19.a - 19.d) \nApplicant claimed that the store reduced the debt to the creditor of SOR \u00b6 1.a to \naround $90,000. He also claimed that the debt to the creditor of SOR \u00b6 1.c was reduced \nthrough the store\u2019s payments between 2015 and 2018. He believes that the creditor of \nSOR \u00b6 1.c was satisfied by taking the store\u2019s inventory and property when the store \nclosed. He further believes that both creditors are no longer collecting the debts because \nthey have not contacted him since 2018, and they have not filed a collection action or \nobtained a judgment against him. He failed to present documentary evidence to support \nhis claims. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and (d) are applicable. Applicant sought financial advice from an \nattorney seeking to file for bankruptcy protection, and he initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to repay most of his creditors. I note that the credit reports on file show \nApplicant paid or resolved several accounts, and is current and paying many accounts \nresulting from the failed business, but not alleged in the SOR. \nI considered that Applicant did not address SOR \u00b6 1.b until after he received the \nSOR. However, the evidence shows that he paid other accounts not alleged in the SOR \nbefore the SOR was issued. I also considered that Applicant has not had any additional \ndelinquent accounts since 2018, and that he was candid and forthcoming during the \nclearance process. Considering the record as a whole, I find that Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances and that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndelinquent debts. His past financial behavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of \nwhether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My \ncomments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 65, served in the U.S. Army for 22 years. During ten of those years he \nserved in Special Forces units. Those assignments were followed by assignments to \nSignal and Intelligence units before he was honorably retired. He has worked for federal \ncontractors since he retired in 2000 until the present. He has held eligibility for a \nclearance, sometimes at a top-secret level or higher, without any security concerns, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nexcept for those in the SOR. His Government supervisors lauded Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, integrity, and judgement. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond his control \nand are unlikely to recur. I believe that his prior behavior shows that he will maintain his \nfinancial responsibility in the future. He established viable payment plans with those \ncreditors willing to take partial payments and is complying with his payment agreements. \nHe is making good-faith efforts to resolve his financial problems. Applicant has \ndemonstrated the reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment required to protect \nclassified information. He is in control of his financial situation. Given the opportunity, \nApplicant will continue to pay his financial obligations. \nThe AGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each and every \ndebt alleged in the SOR, to be debt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. Applicant has implemented a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and he has made substantial progress implementing his plan. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied the SOR allegation (although her accompanying explanations admitted some aspects). After a thorough and careful review of all the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 63 years old. She is a tenured professor at a state university where she has worked since 1996. She previously held a security clearance since 2009, until it was suspended in 2015, because of the allegation that led to this hearing. Her clearance was initially granted because of her research work in areas that led to university contracts with the DOD. She is married with no children. She holds a Ph.D. (Tr. 7, 36, 120, GE 1) The SOR alleged: \u201cIn response to the cessation of the [DOD agency\u2019s] funding of your [research], [Applicant] threatened to solicit funding from China, Israel and Iran in exchange for the sensitive research.\u201d It is significant to note that the single allegation failed to allege the date, location, or circumstances surrounding the alleged statement. Additionally, no amendment was offered to clarify the allegation. (SOR, December 16, 2020) As stated above, Applicant held a clearance in 2009 and her university had a contract with a DOD agency to provide research in the area of her expertise. The contract began in September 2009 and ran until December 2014, using a no-cost modification of the contract.

After a thorough and careful review of all the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 63 years old. She is a tenured professor at a state university where \nshe has worked since 1996. She previously held a security clearance since 2009, until it \nwas suspended in 2015, because of the allegation that led to this hearing. Her \nclearance was initially granted because of her research work in areas that led to \nuniversity contracts with the DOD. She is married with no children. She holds a Ph.D. \n(Tr. 7, 36, 120, GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged: \u201cIn response to the cessation of the [DOD agency\u2019s] funding of \nyour [research], [Applicant] threatened to solicit funding from China, Israel and Iran in \nexchange for the sensitive research.\u201d It is significant to note that the single allegation \nfailed to allege the date, location, or circumstances surrounding the alleged statement. \nAdditionally, no amendment was offered to clarify the allegation. (SOR, December 16, \n2020) \nAs stated above, Applicant held a clearance in 2009 and her university had a \ncontract with a DOD agency to provide research in the area of her expertise. The \ncontract began in September 2009 and ran until December 2014, using a no-cost \nmodification of the contract. In early 2015, Applicant informed the DOD agency of \nbreakthroughs in her research and in early March 2015 her university, on her behalf, \nrequested a no-cost extension to the research contract. On March 31, 2015, Applicant \nwas notified by the DOD agency that her research could no longer be funded and that \nthe agency would not pursue any further contract awards. Applicant was stunned by this \ndecision since she had been working on this project for over 12 years. (Tr. 36, 44, 47, \n57; AE A1, AE B19) \nOn March 24, 2015, Appellant received an email from the DOD agency \nrequesting Applicant \u201cnot to make any public distribution\u201d of the research until a \nclassification determination was made. Applicant\u2019s research was already in the public \neye since she was interviewed about it by a public television program in 2013 and her \nwork was written about in a renowned newspaper and an alumni magazine in 2011. The \nGovernment failed to produce any evidence that the research project Applicant was \nworking on involved classified information. Furthermore, the evidence in the record \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupports the contrary, that the project was unclassified. This conclusion is confirmed by \na July 2016 letter from a DOD Agency\u2019s security officer to Applicant\u2019s university\u2019s facility\nsecurity officer (FSO) and in the testimony of Applicant\u2019s current assistant FSO, who\nstated that no research project Applicant worked on, currently or in the past, was of a \nclassified nature. (Tr. 177-178, 180, 182; AE A2-A4, AE B5-7, B15-B18) \n \n \n \n \nAfter receiving the news that her research work would no longer be funded, \nApplicant was in a highly emotional state. On April 1, 2015, she called Dr. W, her former \nprogram manager at the DOD agency. Applicant asserts that Dr. W talked with her, but \nalso told her he would deny this conversation if asked about it. Applicant wanted to \nknow if there was still any interest in her research work by the DOD. He answered with \nan emphatic \u201cyes.\u201d He also stated that he was not supposed to talk to her but took the \ncall because he believed she was \u201closing her life\u2019s work.\u201d Applicant had a very strong \nemotional reaction to this statement and took the phone away from her ear and began \ncrying. She did not hear what Dr. W said next. At some point her anger boiled up and \nshe stated words to the effect of, \u201cwhy don\u2019t I just send my research to China, Iran, and \nIsrael.\u201d She later realized she should not have made that statement, but was overcome \nby her emotions. She regrets making the statement. She never made any attempt to \ncontact any of those countries. She also telephoned Dr. C about the same time and \nmay have had a similar conversation, but she was so emotional she cannot recall the \nspecifics of the phone call, other than talking about losing her life\u2019s work. During her \nbackground interview in November 2018 and later in February 2020, with an \ninvestigator, she admitted making the statement to Dr. W, concerning her research and \nforeign countries. There is no evidence indicating the investigator asked her about other \nsimilar statements. (Tr. 48-49, 55-58, 116-118, 134; GE 2; AE A1) \nIn May 2015, Applicant attended a conference hosted by the DOD agency that \ndenied funding on the contract described above. Dr. V, a program manager of the DOD \nagency, prepared a June 10, 2015 memo for record (MFR), on agency letterhead,\nwithout a reference to distribution, describing an interaction she had with Applicant at\nthe conference on May 14, 2015. Dr. V stated that after some discussion about \nprocedures for releasing information to the public, Applicant stated \u201cshe didn\u2019t\nnecessarily want to do anything to harm the US government.\u201d When Dr. V asked for \nclarification, she claims Applicant stated that the Chinese, Israelis, and Iranians would\nbe interested in funding her research. In her MFR, she stated that Dr. C witnessed this\nconversation. Dr. V\u2019s MFR became the basis for the information contained in GE 5. Dr.\nV did not testify at Applicant\u2019s hearing and was not subject to cross examination. (GE 4-\n5; AE 1A) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she first became aware of her alleged May 2015 \nstatement to Dr. V when she was sent the Government\u2019s proposed hearing exhibits on \nMay 13, 2021, after the issuance of the SOR. (See HE I) Applicant admitted attending \nthe conference and speaking with Dr. V, but she denied making the statements about \nharming the U.S. and seeking out foreign investors (China, Iran, Israel) for her research. \nShe believes the MFR inaccurately describes the discussion she had with Dr. V. She \nalso testified that the only time she clearly recalls making a reference to China, Israel, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand Iran about her research was the April 1, 2015 emotional call she made to Dr. W. \nShe believes she could have made a similar statement to Dr. C also in a phone call on \nApril 1, 2015, but she does not clearly remember doing so. Upon learning of the MFR,\nApplicant contacted Dr. C to learn her recollections of the conversation discussed in the \nmemo. Dr. C provided several responses. In a May 19, 2021 email to Applicant, Dr. C\nstated: \u201cAs for the events of 2015, I honestly just remember there being confusion about \nfunding and release review. I don\u2019t remember talking to you and having [Dr. V] walk up; \nI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be more helpful.\u201d In an October 29, 2021 email Applicant asked if Dr. C \nrecalled if Applicant made any statements of a security concern at the May 2015 \nconference and Dr. C replied: \u201cI recall you saying, at some point (2015? Don\u2019t know) \nthat you had foreign investors interested in your research and that you could look to \nthem to sustain the work if [the DOD agency] ended its funding of the program. That\u2019s \nthe only thing I can think of that could be related to your question.\u201d In a November 1, \n2021 email, Dr. C stated to Applicant: \u201cI\u2019m confident that you have been honest with the \nDOD; it\u2019s clear that integrity (scientific and otherwise) is one of your highest values.\u201d (Tr.\n59-60, 84, 87, 94-100, 115, 135; GE 4-5; AE A1, AE B22, B45, B47) \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant called her therapist to testify, Mr. S. Mr. S is a licensed clinical social \nworker in private practice as a therapist. He holds a master\u2019s degree obtained in 2001. \nMr. S has been seeing Applicant since 2016. She sought treatment voluntarily, under no \ncompulsion from anyone or any organization. Initially, for the first few years, he saw \nApplicant weekly or biweekly. In the last year and a half, he has seen her on a check-in \nbasis. Based upon his education, training, and experience, he diagnosed Applicant as \nhaving an adjustment disorder with anxiety. That diagnosis was made in September \n2016. Mr. S described his actions to deal with her diagnosis, which included using \nsensory motor psychotherapy to develop her skills for coping with the triggers for her \ncondition. (Tr. 64-66) \nApplicant told Mr. S about the statement she made to Dr. W on April 1, 2015, \nconcerning contacting China, Israel, and Iran about funding her research. Mr. S believes \nApplicant took the statement about losing her life\u2019s work as an existential threat. She \nwas in a highly emotional state at the time and reacted by making an over-the-top \nstatement. She does not have an anti-social personality and regretted making the \nstatement. Mr. S opined, based upon his experience, training, education, and treatment \nof Applicant, that she would not actually engage in the behavior she talked about with \nDr. W on April 1, 2015, i.e., contacting foreign states about her research. He further \nstated that Applicant sometimes gets emotional in their sessions, but she has never \nmade any threatening statements. Overall, she is emotionally stable, self-aware, and \nhas insight into her condition. She also has developed the skills necessary to avoid \ntriggering highly emotional responses. He believes that Applicant exercises \u201cvery good\u201d \njudgment. (Tr. 67-68, 70-71, 73-76, 79-80) \nApplicant\u2019s second level supervisor, Dean N, who is the Dean of the college \nwhere Applicant teaches, testified. Dean N is also a professor of psychology and \nneurosciences. She has known Applicant for 12 years, but only in a work capacity. \nBefore 2016, Dean N had to deal with some issues with Applicant involving emotional \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \noutbursts. Since 2016, she has had no issues or complaints about Applicant. Dean N \ncommented that she has noticed changes in Applicant in the form of her being more \nself-assured and more controlled. She further noted that Applicant has always accepted \nresponsibility for her actions. She stated that Applicant is not impulsive, is trustworthy, \nexercises good judgment, and is a brilliant scientist. (Tr. 149-153, 156-157) \nApplicant presented the testimony of a long-time family friend, Mrs. G. Mrs. G is \n92 years old and her testimony was clear and concise. Mrs. G has known Applicant for \nover 50 years, since Applicant was a little girl living in the same town as Mrs. G. They \nhave stayed in contact through the years and in the past ten years have had weekly \ncontact by texts or emails. Mrs. G described Applicant\u2019s character as \u201cimpeccable.\u201d She \nconsiders Applicant as trustworthy as her deceased husband who worked for a \ngovernment agency for more than 25 years and whose service was honored by being \nnamed to the agency\u2019s Wall of Fame. She knew Applicant was upset when her research \nproject was not funded. Mrs. G was upset as well because she knew how much time \nand effort Applicant had devoted to the research. Mrs. G has never held a security \nclearance. (Tr. 168-170, 172-173) \nThe current assistant FSO for Applicant\u2019s university testified. He has held his \nposition since 2019. He possesses a security clearance. He has known Applicant since \n2019. He was not involved with the university before 2019. He reviewed the current \nresearch projects at the university and determined that none of Applicant\u2019s work \ninvolved classified information. He also reviewed her past projects and determined that \nnone of it involved classified information. He and Applicant discussed the events that \nled to the issuance of the SOR and he noted that Applicant admitted her mistakes and \nwas willing to atone for her actions. Based upon his review of the SOR incident and his \ndealings with Applicant, he recommends granting her security clearance. (Tr. 177-180, \n182, 184) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nThe sole SOR allegation alleges that after a DOD agency denied funding for her \nresearch project, Applicant threatened to contact the countries of China, Israel, and Iran \nabout possible funding for her research project. The allegation lacks specificity in that it \ndoes not give a date, location, or indicate whether the statement was made more than \nonce. At the time of the SOR issuance, Applicant had not been provided the June 2016 \nMFR by Dr. V (GE 4). She also was not asked about her May 14, 2015 statement during \nher background investigation in February 2020 or November 2018. As such, when she \nfiled her answer to the SOR, it was reasonable for her to conclude that the incident the \nSOR was describing was her April 1, 2015 telephone conversation. In her answer to the \nSOR, she admitted the conduct while also explaining her highly emotional state at the \ntime. \nIt is also important to understand that there was NO evidence presented that any \nclassified information was ever disclosed. Moreover, there was NO evidence presented \nthat any of Applicant\u2019s research work was ever classified. In fact, there is evidence to \nthe contrary, that her research WAS NOT classified. So the gravamen of this case is an \nalleged threat of disclosure, said when in a highly emotional state, that was never \ncarried out, about research that was not classified, and which a DOD agency had \ndecided not to further fund. Regardless, I have concluded that Applicant\u2019s statement to \nDr. W on April 1, 2015, demonstrated questionable judgment by her that falls under the \numbrella of covered conduct described by AG \u00b6 16(d). \nAs far as the evidence concerning the alleged conversation between Applicant \nand Dr. V at a conference on May 14, 2014, I have considered the factual conflict \nbetween Applicant\u2019s version of the events and Dr. V\u2019s MFR where she describes her \nversion on what happened on May 14, 2015, at the conference. I note that Dr. V claims \na third party (Dr. C) witnessed the conversation between Applicant and Dr. V. Applicant \nwas finally made aware of Dr. V\u2019s MFR when she received the Government\u2019s hearing \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexhibits on May 13, 2021. Soon thereafter, she contacted Dr. C about her memory of \nthe conversation. Dr. C did not remember the conversation referred to by Dr. V. She \nalso referred to Applicant as a person of integrity. I note that Dr. V wrote the MFR on \nagency letterhead approximately one month after the conference. However, the MFR \ndoes not indicate any distribution network. Dr. V did not testify and was not subject to \ncross examination. I also considered Applicant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and honesty \nas established by her character witnesses. Taking all these factors into consideration, I \ngive the MFR less weight than I do Applicant\u2019s testimony, which I found credible and \nbelievable, based not only on that evidence but also upon my own observations. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and   \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant acknowledged making her statement to Dr. W when she was highly \nemotional and regrets making it. Moreover, she did not follow through on the threat. The \nstatement occurred in 2015, nearly seven years ago. While the nature of her conduct is \nnot minor, it was an isolated incident. Similar conduct is unlikely to occur and it does not \ncast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \nAdditionally, realizing that she needed to seek professional help concerning controlling \nher emotional response to situations, Applicant voluntarily started therapy with a \nqualified licensed clinical social worker in 2016. Her therapist has seen marked \nprogress in Applicant since he started seeing her. He opined that she is emotionally \nstable, self-aware, and has insight into her condition. She also has developed the skills \nnecessary to avoid triggering highly emotional responses. He also believes that \nApplicant exercises \u201cvery good\u201d judgment. Based upon this evidence, AG \u00b6 17(d) \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s position as \na tenured university professor; the testimony of her therapist; the positive character \nevidence given by her university Dean, her longtime personal friend, Mrs. G, and her \nassistant FSO. I also considered the time elapsed since the events of 2015 and the lack \nof evidence of any similar situations. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate \nthe security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude the security concern under the Guideline E, personal conduct, was mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 28, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b, with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old. He graduated from high school in 1982. He married in \n1989 and has three adult stepchildren. He was employed from October 2005 to June \n2016, and has worked for his current employer since April 2017. He was unemployed \nfrom June 2016 to April 2017. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file, as required, Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax year 2018, and that he owes approximately $10,000 in delinquent \nFederal income taxes, and approximately $3,000 in delinquent state income taxes for tax \nyear 2018. (Item 1) \nIn his March 2020 SCA, Applicant reported that he failed to file Federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax year 2018, and estimated his combined tax debt to be $13,000. \nHe explained that he did not file the returns or pay the required income taxes because he \ncould not pay the taxes due. He attributed his financial difficulties to his wife\u2019s retirement \nand his failure to withhold sufficient funds to pay taxes incurred when he withdrew funds \nfrom a retirement account in order to pay bills. He stated his intent to pay down the debt \nwith anticipated tax refunds and then to negotiate payment plans with Federal and state \ntax authorities. (Item 3) \nDuring his background interview with a government investigator on April 9, 2020, \nApplicant confirmed he had not filed or paid his Federal and state income taxes for tax \nyear 2018. He reported commercial software he used to prepare his income tax returns \nin early 2019 reflected that he owed approximately $10,000 in Federal income taxes, and \n$3,000 in state income taxes. He decided not to file the income tax returns because he \ncould not afford to pay the amounts due. He attributed his financial difficulties to a \nreduction in income after his wife was injured and unable to work or run her business, \nand a greater than anticipated tax liability for a $30,000 withdrawal from a retirement \naccount he used to pay bills. He acknowledged that he had not contacted Federal or state \ntax authorities regarding his delinquent taxes. He stated his intent to use anticipated tax \nyear 2019 income tax refunds to make payments on the delinquent taxes and to then \nnegotiate payment plans with Federal and state tax authorities. (Item 4) \nIn his August 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b.

He stated he was in the process of paying off the IRS \ndebt and provided the first page of a five-page IRS Notice CP521 addressed to him and \nhis wife dated March 17, 2021. The IRS notice references his installment agreement for \ntax year 2018, reflects the amount owed ($14,480.39), monthly payments due ($286.00), \nthat the last payment amount ($286.00) was made on March 2, 2021, and that the next \npayment ($286.00) was due March 28, 2021. (Item 2)   \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax return for tax year 2018. A \nFederal income tax return for tax year 2018 was apparently filed sometime after his April \n9, 2020 background interview and on or before March 17, 2021, the date of the IRS Notice \nCP521, because a \u201crequest for an installment agreement will be denied if any required \ntax returns haven\u2019t been filed.\u201d https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i9465 (Instructions for \nForm 9465 (10/2020)). (Items 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant did not claim or provide documentary evidence to show that he filed the \nstate income tax return for tax year 2018 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, or that he paid the \ndelinquent state income taxes alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He did not provide evidence, \ndocumented or otherwise, of his current financial budget, savings or expendable income. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2018 \nand owed at least $13,000 in delinquent Federal and state income taxes. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) warrants some consideration because the SOR alleges delinquent \nFederal and state income taxes for a single tax year. Applicant provided documentary \nevidence that his tax year 2018 Federal income tax return was filed late, that he enrolled \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nin an installment agreement with the IRS for that tax year, and that he made a monthly \npayment due under that agreement in March 2021. There is no evidence of any additional \npayment to the IRS under that installment agreement, and no evidence that he filed a \nstate income tax return for tax year 2018 or made any payment on his delinquent state \nincome taxes. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply, because Applicant\u2019s delinquent Federal \nand state tax issues are ongoing. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s medical issues and associated reduced income impacted his \nability to pay his Federal and state income taxes for tax year 2018. The first prong of AG \n\u00b6 20(b) therefore applies to his delinquent tax debt. However, those conditions did not \nimpact his ability to timely file Federal and state income tax returns, or to contact or make \npayment arrangements with Federal and state tax authorities. The evidence is insufficient \nto demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \nfully apply. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there is no evidence Applicant has received, \nor is receiving financial counseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(g) partially apply. Applicant\u2019s Federal income tax return \nfor tax year 2018 was apparently filed, albeit late. He was also enrolled in an installment \nagreement with the IRS for the delinquent Federal income taxes as of March 2021, and \nmade a payment under that agreement in March 2021. AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(g) do not \nfully apply because a single monthly payment on a substantial tax debt does not establish \na reliable track record of consistent monthly payments in compliance with the installment \nagreement. And there is no evidence that he filed a state income tax return for tax year \n2018 or that he paid the delinquent state income taxes due. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is 58 years old, and that there is no evidence of \nadditional financial concerns. I also considered that his wife\u2019s medical issues and \nassociated reduced income impacted his ability to pay his Federal and state income taxes \ndue for tax year 2018. However, he is responsible for ensuring his Federal and state\nincome tax returns are timely filed and paid. The evidence reflects his tax year 2018\nFederal income tax return was filed late, that he made one payment under an instalment \nagreement with the IRS, and that after that payment he still owed the IRS approximately \n$14,480.39 for tax year 2018 as of March 2021. There is no evidence that he filed a state\nincome tax return for tax year 2018 or that he paid the delinquent state income taxes due. \n \n \n \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nWhile difficulty in meeting financial obligations may force an applicant to \nchoose the order in which he or she addresses unpaid debts, they do not \nprovide a plausible excuse to failing to meet an important legal requirement, \nsuch as filing returns when due. Indeed, the Directive cites failure to file \nreturns as a disqualifying condition in and of itself, irrespective of whether \nthe underlying taxes have actually been paid, as through withholding, etc. \nISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017). \nApplicant\u2019s failure to comply with the fundamental legal obligation to timely file and \npay his Federal and state income taxes raise serious security concerns. \u201cA security \nclearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of \nnational secrets [and] failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct \nbearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). Although there is \nsome evidence in mitigation, Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion and the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant claimed that this \ndebt belonged to his ex-spouse, which she incurred in 2014 while they were separated. \nHe stated in his Answer to the SOR that he was disputing the account. He testified that \nhis ex-spouse moved to another state and apparently leased an apartment, and later left \nwith an unpaid debt. His name appears as a joint account on his September 2020 credit \nbureau report (CBR), however he testified that he did not sign the lease or live in the \napartment and alleged fraud by his spouse. He stated that he contacted a collection agent \nholding the debt in 2021, and was told that the account was closed and they were unable \nto collect on the debt. No documentary evidence was provided to support a dispute, \ncontact with a collection agent, or of fraud. The account does not appear on his 2022 \nCBR. (AE B) It is unclear why the account has been deleted, but it may have been \nremoved because it is beyond the typical seven-year reporting period. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a bank debt for $4,710. Applicant stated in his Answer that he \ncontacted the bank and was told that the debt was written off because it is more than \nseven years old. He testified that he incurred the debt in about 2014 after he left the \nmilitary and was divorced from his first wife. He testified that he discussed the account \nwith the bank about nine months before the hearing, and agreed to make $100 per month \npayments beginning in December 2021.

In his Answer, Applicant claimed \nthat the debt was incurred by his ex-spouse during their divorce. He claimed that his name \nwas added to the account because he still had a joint savings account with his former \nspouse, and \u201cso when she applied for the loan it added me into it.\u201d He denied ever signing \na loan agreement or agreed to be on listed on the loan.

In testimony, he said \nthat his ex-spouse worked for the creditor in 2007 or 2008, and she agreed to a car loan \nin about 2010. Applicant has not pursued resolution of the debt, despite being able to pay \nit now. Applicant\u2019s CBRs show the account as a charged-off joint account that was \nassigned in 2010, and the last activity was in 2015.

It is unclear why the account has been deleted, but it may have \nbeen removed because it is beyond the typical seven-year reporting period. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a collection account for $837. Applicant said in his Answer that he \nwas unable to determine to whom the debt was owed or how it was incurred. In testimony, \nhe said he has not contacted the creditor or collection agent, and was not in the state \nlisted in 2015. He surmised that his ex-spouse opened the account. The debt appears on \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 and 2020 CBRs, and show the collection account as an individual \naccount, assigned in 2015, and defaulted in 2018. The CBR also lists the original \ncollection agent. Applicant\u2019s 2022 CBR no longer lists the account. It is unclear why the \naccount has been deleted, but it may have been removed because it is beyond the typical \nseven-year reporting period. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a cable provider account placed for collection for $315. Applicant \nagreed with the debt, but claimed that it was written off and not collectable as it is over \nseven years old. (Ans.) In testimony, he said he contacted the creditor and was told they \ndid not have a record of the account. He last used the company in 2013, and claimed to \nhave returned equipment as required. The account is no longer reflected on his 2022 \nCBR.

He has about $27,670 in a checking account, and about \n$20,000 in a 401k retirement account. He claimed to have had unspecified financial \ncounseling while in the military, but none since.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a history of not responsibly meeting financial obligations. He incurred \ndebts while married and possibly while separated. His name apparently remained on joint \naccounts, but he claims that his ex-spouse fraudulently signed his name to contracts and \ncredit agreements. Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence of fraudulent activity or \nefforts to correct or dispute the accounts. Any efforts to inquire into delinquent accounts \nwere done after his security eligibility became an issue. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Also, an applicant who begins to resolve his or her \nfinancial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance is \nin jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and \nregulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. \n(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd.

Applicant also claimed \nto have a payment plan with a credit card issuer, but insufficient documentary evidence \nin support of the plan was provided despite his offer in the hearing to provide such \nevidence. Applicant has also failed to contact creditors on the car loan and other debts in \nwhich he claimed was not his, despite evidence to the contrary in his credit report. Finally, \ncontacting a creditor after a debt was written off does not display financial awareness or \nconcern for financial matters. \nApplicant has a long employment history and should have been in a position to \naddress debts for which he is responsible, or challenge debts wrongfully charged to him. \nRelying on old accounts to drop off of his credit report is not sufficient to alleviate the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns with regard to his past debts or current financial responsibility. \nThe guideline encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and \nother qualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). The Appeal Board has long recognized that debts remain relevant for security \nclearance purposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the \nstatute of limitations. That is, a judge may consider the underlying circumstances of these \nuncollectable debts in evaluating whether an applicant demonstrated good judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. \n27, 2003). \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that several of his debts were in a \ncollection or charged-off status and eventually they were dropped from his credit report. \nShowing that debts were dropped off a credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution. ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal \nof most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of \ndelinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer (Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission \nwebsite, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/ pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of recent or substantive financial \ncounseling. Ignoring debts that one considers to be inappropriate or fraudulent does not \nequate to acting responsibly and in good faith. His failure to dispute fraudulent debts or \notherwise address delinquent accounts puts into question his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. He has not submitted sufficient documentary evidence of fraud or \nfalse accounts for which he is not responsible. Any efforts he made to dispute certain \ndebts are unsupported by documentary evidence. Although Applicant\u2019s current financial \nposition may be improved, his history of financial irresponsibility has not been adequately \naddressed, and his debts were not satisfactorily resolved.

Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and divorces. I remain unconvinced of his overall financial \nresponsibility, efforts to resolve delinquent debts, and his ability, intent, and desire to meet \nhis financial obligations in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered \nthe exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated \nJune 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.h:  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In his January 2019 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed nine foreign contacts, all Chinese nationals, for whom he provided services in 2018. Since becoming employed full-time with his present employer, he indicated he only works part-time in this business. (Items 4, 6) Applicant married a Chinese national in 2018. She was on an F-1 student visa at the time of their marriage. He is sponsoring her for legal permanent resident status in the U.S. They have no children.

Also noted is the exploitation of Chinese citizens or persons \nwith family ties to China to gain insider access to military and defense contract secrets; \neconomic espionage; and the significant ongoing human rights problems in China. \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel requested I take administrative notice of 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 802; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 813; and Adherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting Marijuana Use, Director of National Intelligence, dated October 24, 2014. \n(Item 5) I have taken administrative notice of the requested laws and policy. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2015 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. Applicant has worked for his current employer, a federal \ncontractor, since August 2018. Prior to then he was self-employed full-time. The nature \nof his business was to assist foreign students with the admissions process for attending \ncollege in the United States. In his January 2019 security clearance application (SCA), \nhe disclosed nine foreign contacts, all Chinese nationals, for whom he provided services \nin 2018. Since becoming employed full-time with his present employer, he indicated he \nonly works part-time in this business. (Items 4, 6) \nApplicant married a Chinese national in 2018. She was on an F-1 student visa at \nthe time of their marriage. He is sponsoring her for legal permanent resident status in the \nU.S. They have no children. No information was provided about Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nbackground, contacts, or affiliations with government entities in China. No information \nwas provided regarding her current employment, if any.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother is a resident and citizen of China. No background \ninformation or details were provided about her. No information was provided about \nApplicant\u2019s contacts and associations within China, including his and his wife\u2019s contact \nwith her mother, and any other family members. Applicant noted that he visited China in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 2018 to January 2019, presumably with his wife and presumably to see her \nmother. (Item 6) \nApplicant used marijuana from about March 2017 to at least February 2020 with \nvarying frequency. During his May 2019 background interview with a government \ninvestigator, he said he used marijuana on average about twice a week. In response to \nMay 2020 government interrogatories, he stated his last use was February 2020. He said \nhe uses marijuana for medicinal purposes for migraines, anxiety and tremors due to \nTorrents syndrome. Medicinal marijuana is legal in the state where Applicant resides. He \nhas a valid medical marijuana card from the state. (Items 3, 6) \nIn his background interview, Applicant stated that for career purposes he was \nattempting to find an alternative to marijuana use. In his government interrogatories, he \nresponded that his employer has a drug use policy, but does not require him to undergo \nrandom or periodic tests. He further indicated he understood that marijuana use remains \nillegal under Federal law and any future use of marijuana may affect his security clearance \neligibility. In response to the question, do you intend to illegally use drugs or a controlled \nsubstance in the future, he responded yes, he would use medical marijuana. (Items 3 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThere are significant espionage concerns and ongoing human rights problems in \nChina. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, through his \nwife, who is a citizen of China living with him in the United States, and his mother-in-law \nwho is a citizen and resident of China. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersonal are located, or the positions or activities of those person in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, and the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. Applicant\u2019s wife and mother-in-law are citizens of \nChina. His mother-in-law resides in China. No information was provided regarding either \nperson\u2019s background, employment, affiliations, and financial interests in China. Applicant \nobviously has contact with his wife. However, no information was provided regarding his \nwife\u2019s contact with her mother or any other relatives in China. It appears Applicant traveled \nto China in December 2018-January 2019, but additional evidence was not provided, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsuch as who they had contact with while there. It is presumed they visited her mother. \nChina is a country that actively engages in espionage and exploits Chinese citizens or \npersons with family ties to China to gain insider access to sensitive and classified \ninformation. Applicant failed to provide evidence to mitigate the foreign influence security \nconcerns raised. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant admits he used marijuana from March 2017 until at least February 2020. \nHe disclosed he uses it for medicinal purposes and it is legal in the state where he \nresides. He is also aware that under Federal law it remains illegal. He expressly stated \nhis intention to continue to use marijuana in the future. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant intends to continue using marijuana despite it being a violation of Federal \nlaw and the requirement of abstinence to hold a security clearance. The above mitigating \nconditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and H, in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline B, foreign influence and Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 59 years old. He graduated from high school in 1981. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1982, and served on active duty until he was honorably discharged in 1990. He received the equivalent of two years of college while in the military service, but did not receive a degree. He married in 1985 and divorced in 1997. He married his current wife in 2000. He has four children, ages 29, 20, 14, and 10. Applicant\u2019s work history shows he worked for a federal contractor between 2004 and July 2017. During this period, he was granted eligibility for a clearance. He was hired by a federal contractor in July 2017, and was terminated from his position when his eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) was suspended. In August 2017, Applicant used his then employer\u2019s (Agency) computer system to search for Gamblers Anonymous (GA) locations near him. He also sent several emails referencing gambling transactions, a cash withdrawal from a monetary investment vehicle, and communicated relationship problems speaking of separation, filing bankruptcy, and credit card debt. (GE 12) After his termination, Applicant was unemployed between November 2017 and February 2018, when he was hired by another federal contractor.

At his hearing, Applicant testified that \nhe had sufficient time to prepare, was ready to proceed, and affirmatively waived his right \nto 15-day advance notice of the hearing. (Tr. 15) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 59 years old. He graduated from high school in 1981. He enlisted in \nthe U.S. Army in 1982, and served on active duty until he was honorably discharged in \n1990. He received the equivalent of two years of college while in the military service, but \ndid not receive a degree. He married in 1985 and divorced in 1997. He married his current \nwife in 2000. He has four children, ages 29, 20, 14, and 10. \nApplicant\u2019s work history shows he worked for a federal contractor between 2004 \nand July 2017. During this period, he was granted eligibility for a clearance. He was hired \nby a federal contractor in July 2017, and was terminated from his position when his \neligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) was suspended. In \nAugust 2017, Applicant used his then employer\u2019s (Agency) computer system to search \nfor Gamblers Anonymous (GA) locations near him. He also sent several emails \nreferencing gambling transactions, a cash withdrawal from a monetary investment \nvehicle, and communicated relationship problems speaking of separation, filing \nbankruptcy, and credit card debt. (GE 12) \nAfter his termination, Applicant was unemployed between November 2017 and \nFebruary 2018, when he was hired by another federal contractor. Since then, he has \nworked for three different federal contractors. He was hired by his current employer and \nclearance sponsor in November 2021. (2018 SCA; Tr. 19-23) \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nFebruary 15, 2018, seeking the continuation-reinstatement of his clearance eligibility \nrequired for his job. In his answers to Section 25 (Investigations and Clearance Record) \nof his 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that the Agency suspended his SCI eligibility, \nbecause of the financial considerations concerns that were subsequently alleged in the \nSOR. \nIn his answers to Section 26 (Financial Record), Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d to the \nfollowing questions: (1) In the last seven years, have you filed a petition under any chapter \nof the bankruptcy code? (2) Gambling - \u201cHave you ever experienced financial problems \ndue to gambling?\u201d and (3) Taxes \u2013 \u201cIn the last seven years have you failed to file or pay \nfederal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?\u201d. Applicant failed to \ndisclose in his 2018 SCA that he was having financial problems due to his gambling \nproblem. I note that he submitted his 2018 SCA in February 2018, and he filed his Chapter \n13 bankruptcy in March 2018. \nApplicant failed to disclose that he was experiencing financial and personal \nproblems due to his gambling, that he had delinquent credit-card debt, and that he did not \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npay federal taxes when due.

In the SCA comments section he \nstated: \nMy finance[s] took a beating in 2016 when I receive my inheritance. We \nspent money recklessly . . . we purchased a foreclosure home . . . I dumped \neverything I had and then some to build this house up . . . we also took \nseveral weekend trips and I took a cruise and my family took a few additional \nvacations . . . I have never been late on any payments and I am still current \n. . . when the agency pulled my SCI and I became unemployed it added a \ntremendous amount of additional debt . . . I had to take a job making much \nless  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant filed three bankruptcies: a Chapter 7, filed and \ndischarged in 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a Chapter 13, filed in 2009 and discharged in 2015 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b); and a Chapter 13, filed in March 2018, and dismissed in November 2018 for failure \nto make plan payments. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) The SOR further alleged that he owed the IRS \n$34,548 for delinquent taxes for tax year (TY) 2016, and $89,220 for TY 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.e); that he had five charged-off accounts totaling $37,326 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f - 1.j); and \nthat he engaged in significant financial transactions to fund his gambling or to pay \ngambling debts, and that his gambling contributed, at least in part, to his delinquent debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k). \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his 2018 SCA when \nhe answered \u201cNO\u201d to the question \u201cHave you ever experienced financial problems due to \ngambling?\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.a) And, that he was terminated from his employment in 2017 after \nhis access to SCI was suspended due to financial considerations and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.f, 1.h, 1.k, and 2.b. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 2.a. He explained that he and \nhis ex-wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996 during the divorce proceedings because it \nwas the only way to split the marital debt to the point where they both could afford to live \nand pay child support. (Tr. 23) In 2009, he filed Chapter 13 because he could not afford \ntwo mortgages. After selling his residence, he bought a new home before the closing of \nthe sale on his old residence. Before the closing on the old residence, the buyer died, and \nhe ended up with two mortgages that he could not afford. After his savings were depleted, \nhe had a short sale on one of the properties and filed bankruptcy. (Tr. 23-24) \nConcerning the 2018 bankruptcy filing, Applicant explained that he was financially \nirresponsible. His father died in 2014 and his mother in 2016. He inherited a share of his \nmother\u2019s IRA, totaling about $467,000, and recklessly spent his inheritance. When asked \nhow much of his inheritance was spent gambling, Applicant quibbled and was unable to \nprovide a straight answer. His best guess was \u201cover $50,000.\u201d (Tr. 25-27) When asked, \nwhat was the reason he filed a Chapter 13 in 2018? He stated: \u201cOriginally, it was because \nall the debt that I incurred after [sic] through the gambling, through just reckless spending, \nvacations, everything else, I figured let's start clean.\u201d (Tr. 43) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claimed that when he realized he had a gambling problem, he dismissed \nthe 2018 bankruptcy to face his creditors because that was the advice GA provides in its \nwebsite. Bankruptcy court documents indicate the 2018 bankruptcy was dismissed for \nfailure to make plan payments. (GE 4) Applicant explained he used some of his \ninheritance to buy a foreclosure home of about 6,500 square feet for about $465,000. He \nclaimed he spent between $50,000 and $75,000 refurbishing the home and purchased a \ncamper to live in for about four months while the house was being refurbished. (Tr. 29) \nRegarding his IRS debt, Applicant explained that he failed to pay sufficient taxes \nwhen he withdrew the funds in his inherited IRA. In 2016, he also withdrew the funds in \nhis $90,000 IRA. When asked why did he withdraw the funds in his IRA, he stated he \ncould not recall. He guessed it probably had to do with paying taxes, expenditures or \ngambling, or a combination of all of these reasons. (Tr. 34-35) The aggregate of his \ninheritance, job income, and withdrawing $90,000 from his IRA raised his tax bracket and \nincreased his tax debt. He believes he reported income of $470,000 in 2016. By the end \nof 2017, Applicant had spent all of his inheritance, the proceeds of the sale of a property, \nand $90,000 from his IRA. (Tr. 35-36) \nApplicant did not pay the proper tax rate for TYs 2016 and 2017. He contacted the \nIRS, paid $10,000, and started a payment plan for TY 2016. Since then, he has stopped \nhis IRS payment plan twice and hired two different companies to help him seek an offer \nin compromise or a settlement for less than owed with the IRS. He claimed he has spent \nover $12,000 in companies\u2019 fees without results. \nApplicant\u2019s documents do not show any payments to the IRS between March 2018 \nand May 2019 and between January 2020 and November 2021. He believes these were \nthe periods during which he hired two companies to negotiate on his behalf with the IRS. \n(Tr. 39-40) As of his hearing date, Applicant had established a payment plan with the IRS \nin which he promised to pay $1,505 monthly. In April 2022, he increased the payment to \n$1,550. He owes the IRS over $32,000 for TY 2016, and over $91,000 for TY 2017. (Tr. \n41) He claimed he paid off his tax debt to his state. (Tr. 42) \nApplicant testified he did not realize he had a gambling problem until after he was \nterminated in 2017 and the 2018 clearance investigation started. After the 2018 \nbankruptcy dismissal, Applicant claimed he contacted the creditors of the charged-off \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h, established payment plans with both creditors, and \nmade payments for a period. He stopped making payments for about six months and \nrecently started a new payment plan. He averred that he has been making payments for \nthe last year or so. \nThe status of the remaining SOR allegations follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($15,887) concerns a car Applicant purchased in 2017. The account \nbecame delinquent in May 2018, and it was charged off. He contacted the creditor and \nestablished a $200 monthly car payment in 2018. He has been making payments as \nagreed since, and reduced the balance owed to $14,487.

He claimed \nthe loan was never delinquent, but he included it on the bankruptcy filing. The credit report \nof March 2021 (GE 8) shows he stopped making payments on the account in May 2018, \nand the account was charged off. After the bankruptcy was dismissed, he negotiated a \nlower pay off balance, and he paid off the account on March 31, 2022 (after he received \nthe July 2021 SOR). (AE A and B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($9,441) alleges a delinquent credit card opened in 2017 that was \ncharged off in 2021. Applicant claimed he was paying $235 monthly and reduced the debt \nto $8,200. He settled the debt for less than the full amount and paid it off on March 3, \n2022. (AE A and B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($8,840) alleges a delinquent credit card that was charged off. Applicant\nclaimed he contacted the creditor before he received the SOR and settled and paid it. \nThe documentary evidence shows that he resolved the account on April 22, 2022 (after \nthe SOR was issued). (AE C) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($122) alleges a charged-off credit account. Applicant contacted the \ncreditor before he received the SOR and settled and paid off the debt. He paid the account \nin February 2021, before the SOR was issued. (GE 8; Tr. 44-49) \nIn his answer to the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, and\n1.j because he paid them off before the SOR was issued in July 2021. Documentary \nevidence shows he paid SOR \u00b6 1.g on March 2022, SOR \u00b6 1.i in March 2022, and SOR \n\u00b6 1.j in February 2021. (AE A, B) \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.k, Applicant admitted he engaged in significant transactions \nto fund his gambling. He averred he did not have a gambling debt because he used his \ninheritance to fund or pay off his gambling debt. He argued that his gambling did not \ncontribute to his delinquent debts. He believes that losing his SCI eligibility, being \nterminated from his job, being unemployed for four months, and working for about \n$35,000 less than what he used to earn contributed to his delinquent debt. \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant claimed he did not falsify his February 2018 SCA \nwhen he answered NO to the question whether he had ever experienced financial \nproblems due to gambling. He testified that he has been a gambler his whole life. He likes \ngoing to casinos. Brick and mortar gambling was always something he did with his wife \nand friends. They would go out to casinos two or three trips a year to have fun. It was \nalways a very nice environment, he traveled to nice places, and it was part of his social \nactivities. (Tr. 29-30) He claimed he always paid his debts on time. \nApplicant\u2019s claims of lack of falsification are not credible. In August 2017, he used \nhis Agency\u2019s computer system to search for Gamblers Anonymous (GA) locations near \nhim. He also sent several emails referencing gambling transactions, a cash withdrawal \nfrom a monetary investment vehicle, and communicated relationship problems speaking \nof separation, filing bankruptcy, and credit card debt.

He noted that his wife is accustomed to \nliving an extravagant lifestyle, and she took at least three more cruises than he did. (GE \n2) The day of his hearing, he indicated his family was in a cruise, but that he could no \nlonger travel with them in cruises because of his gambling problem. (Tr. 56) \nApplicant believes that what got him into financial trouble in 2016 was his online \ngambling, not visiting casinos. He stated he became involved in online gambling \nmoderately when his stepdad died in 2014. But when his mother died in 2016, he got into \nonline gambling heavily. He gambled every day, and the internet made it easy for him to \nspend thousands of dollars right from his cell phone. Before he inherited his mother\u2019s IRA, \nApplicant stated he did not have the money to gamble because he was living from \npaycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 29-31) \nApplicant\u2019s online gambling was done with overseas companies, and he did not \nreceive any IRS forms W-2G for TY 2016 and 2017. Between May and August 2017, \nApplicant debited $53,261 from one of his checking accounts to pay international \ngambling businesses located in China, Thailand, England, and Shanghai. (GE 2) When \nhe disclosed to his wife his gambling problems in 2017, she filed for legal separation. \nApplicant claimed he has not participated in any online gambling since 2017. He admitted \nhe continued gambling in casinos for a period during 2018, until he decided to attend GA. \nHe also gambled in 2019 during a cruise with his family. He used the proceeds of the sale \nof one of his properties to gamble during a cruise. He averred his \u201cclean date,\u201d the day \nhe stopped gambling, was September 22, 2019. He had gambled the night before, but \npromised his spouse he would stop gambling. He testified he gambled again in July 2020, \nand reported the incident to his GA sponsor. \nApplicant testified that after almost three years of attending GA meetings, he \nrealized that a lot of the negative things that happened in his life had to do with his \ngambling. Now that has learned about himself through GA, he realizes that gambling has \nbeen an issue his whole life. (Tr. 31) He believes he accepted responsibility for every debt \nhe had and paid them off. He also believes he made a tremendous effort to correct his \nIRS issues, get his clearance back, and support his family. (Tr. 18) \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his \nemployment with a federal contractor in 2017 after his access to SCI was suspended. He \nnoted that he is considered to be a valuable employee and received a clearance about \none year after he was terminated. He believes he has demonstrated that he has been \ntrustworthy, open and honest with his peers, security personnel, and his company. \nApplicant believes that his financial situation is good. He is current with his recent \nfinancial obligations. He believes that his credit reports show that during the past three \nyears he established a good credit payment history.

It's something that is \nnot going to go away. It is something I have to continue to work on and be aware of, and \nit is important to surround myself with a support system. But I can tell you without doubt \nthat my financial problems probably for the past 20 years have stemmed one way or \nanother from my gambling or inability to value money. (Tr. 57) \nApplicant stated he intends to continue attending GA and to avoid gambling. He \npromised to remain abstinent in the future. Notwithstanding, he is not currently attending \nGA meetings on a frequent basis. Since June 2021, he attended one GA meeting during \nthe second week of February 2022. He claimed he was attending GA meetings until he \nmoved to his current residence. He stated that due to COVID-19, the three GAs by his \ncurrent residence have closed. There's one still available, and he went to it in February \n2022, but he does not like the format. He claimed he stays in touch with his sponsor, but \nwith his stress, he acknowledged that he needs to go back to GA meetings. He claimed \nhe has not gambled since 2020. He stated he reads his book and stays in contact with \nhis sponsor. He presented no documentary evidence to corroborate his attendance of GA \nmeetings, or his conversations with his sponsor. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. (See Section 7 of EO 10865; See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) \n(listing prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information))  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file . . . or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; and \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems causes by \ngambling. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 1996, a Chapter 13 \ndischarge in 2015, and filed for a Chapter 13 in 2018, which was dismissed for lack of \nplan payments. He is indebted to the IRS for over $124,000 for his failure to pay income \ntaxes when owed. Although he has a payment agreement, he has reneged on the \nagreement twice, seeking an offer in compromise or a reduction of his debt. He \naccumulated five accounts, totaling over $37,000, that were charged-off. His \ndocumentary evidence shows he established a payment agreement and has been making \npayments on SOR \u00b6 1.f since 2018. He settled and paid off SOR \u00b6 1.g in March 2022, \nSOR \u00b6 1.h in March 2022, SOR \u00b6 1.i in April 2022, and SOR \u00b6 1.j was paid before the \nSOR was issued in July 2021. The facts in the record establish the above disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), (f), and (i), requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file of pay the amounts owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (g) are partially applicable because Applicant has resolved the \nSOR debts and established a payment plan with the IRS. They are not fully applicable \nand do not mitigate the security concerns because Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior is \nrecent, occurred frequently, it is likely to recur, and it still casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable because \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not due to circumstances beyond his control. His \nperiods of unemployment, underemployment, legal separation, and debts were due to his \ngambling problems. Additionally, his evidence is insufficient to show that he was \nfinancially responsible under his circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable because Applicant failed to present evidence to show \nthat he received or is receiving financial counseling. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems resulted from his gambling. He failed to submit evidence to corroborate his \nclaims of consistent attendance to GA and communications with a sponsor. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows that \nhe established a payment plan with the IRS and is complying with it. It does not fully apply \nbecause he stopped his payment plan with the IRS twice. He receives credit for settling \nand making payments to the creditors of the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f and SOR \u00b6 \n1.j before he received the SOR. All the other SOR delinquent accounts were paid after \nthe SOR was issued.  \nApplicant receives credit for his military service and recent efforts to pay or resolve \nhis delinquent debts after receipt of the SOR. Notwithstanding, I am unable to find that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His evidence is insufficient to explain why he was unable to address his delinquent \naccounts more diligently. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that his \nfinancial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. His financial issues are the \nresult of his gambling habit, and they are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security \nconcerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant from any \npersonal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, \nor award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn July and August 2017, Applicant was aware of his gambling problem and sent \nseveral emails referencing gambling transactions, a cash withdrawal from a monetary \ninvestment vehicle, and he communicated relationship problems speaking of separation, \nfiling bankruptcy, and credit card debt. (GE 12) When he submitted his 2018 SCA, he \nknew he had accounts that were delinquent, as a result of his gambling problem, and that \nhis wife threatened him with legal separation. He deliberately falsified his 2018 SCA when \nhe answered NO and failed to disclose that he was experiencing financial problems due \nto his gambling. He also admitted he engaged in significant financial transactions to fund \nhis gambling and pay gambling debt. His lack of candor and dishonesty demonstrate \nquestionable judgment, unreliability, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, establishing the above disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline. Only two of those mitigating conditions are potentially applicable to \nthe facts in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAfter thorough consideration of the facts, the above mitigating conditions are not \nsupported by the facts in this case, and they are not applicable. Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to fully establish any mitigating factors under AG \u00b6 17. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant, 59, has been working for federal contractors since at least 2004, while \npossessing eligibility for a clearance. He served eight years in the Army and received an \nhonorable discharge. He started the process to pay or resolve most of the delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR after receipt of the SOR. He has made a good start to \nestablish his future financial responsibility. Notwithstanding, financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated at this time. He should have been more diligent \naddressing and resolving his delinquent accounts, in particular addressing his large debt \nto the IRS. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by his gambling \nproblem. His evidence is insufficient to show that his gambling is under control, or that he \nhas been receiving sufficient counseling to prevent recurrence. Additionally, he failed to \ndisclose his gambling and financial problems in his 2018 SCA. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations \nand personal conduct security concerns. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security\nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)).  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due debt and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:   \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r to 1.aa, 1.ee to 1.gg, and 1.jj, which she denied. She is 55 years old. She married in 1987, divorced in 2002, remarried in 2003, and divorced in 2010. As of the date of the hearing, she lived with her fianc\u00e9 since 2016. She has three adult children. She graduated from high school in 1984 and attended some college but did not earn a degree. (Answer; Tr. at 6-7, 11, 23, 27-28; GE 1) Applicant worked as a U.S. Government civilian from approximately 1991 to 1992, 1998 to 1999, and in 2014. She held inconsistent employment with minimal income and had periods of unemployment between 2009 to 2016, to include six months in 2009, one month in 2010, and from 2014 to 2016. Since 2016, she has primarily worked as an over- the-road (OTR) truck driver. In 2019, she became a working partner in her fianc\u00e9\u2019s trucking business. As of the date of the hearing and since approximately January 2020, her fianc\u00e9\u2019s company contracted with a DOD transportation company, for whom Applicant previously worked from February to June 2019. Applicant testified that her fianc\u00e9 had a security clearance, and she has never held one.

She is 55 years old. She married in 1987, divorced in \n2002, remarried in 2003, and divorced in 2010. As of the date of the hearing, she lived \nwith her fianc\u00e9 since 2016. She has three adult children. She graduated from high school \nin 1984 and attended some college but did not earn a degree. (Answer; Tr. at 6-7, 11, 23, \n27-28; GE 1) \nApplicant worked as a U.S. Government civilian from approximately 1991 to 1992, \n1998 to 1999, and in 2014.  She held inconsistent employment with minimal income and \nhad periods of unemployment between 2009 to 2016, to include six months in 2009, one \nmonth in 2010, and from 2014 to 2016. Since 2016, she has primarily worked as an over-\nthe-road (OTR) truck driver. In 2019, she became a working partner in her fianc\u00e9\u2019s \ntrucking business. As of the date of the hearing and since approximately January 2020, \nher fianc\u00e9\u2019s company contracted with a DOD transportation company, for whom Applicant \npreviously worked from February to June 2019. Applicant testified that her fianc\u00e9 had a \nsecurity clearance, and she has never held one. (Answer; Tr. at 7-8, 21-26, 28-34, 39-40, \n48-51, 62; GE 1)  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 2 delinquent consumer accounts totaling \napproximately $10,718 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.kk) and 35 delinquent medical accounts totaling \napproximately $79,444 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.jj). The SOR allegations are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer, 2020 security clearance application (SCA), and \n2020 background interview, and by credit bureau reports from 2020 and 2021. All of the \nSOR debts are delinquently reported on the 2020 credit bureau report, and SOR debts \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d to 1.g, and 1.i to 1.m are delinquently reported on the 2021 credit bureau \nreport.

(Answer; GE 1-4) \nApplicant attributes her delinquent debts to a relocation in 2009 for a job as a pastry \nchef in a restaurant that ultimately failed to open. From 2009 to 2014, she worked multiple \nlow-paying jobs, had periods of unemployment, as previously discussed, and endured a \nfailed relationship. She also suffered from physical and stress-related problems, for which \nshe was prescribed multiple medications by various doctors and was hospitalized three \ntimes between 2014 and 2016. During this period, she did not have health insurance, and \nshe was denied state housing assistance, Medicaid, food stamps, and disability benefits. \nHer mother passed away in 2016 from a terminal illness that depleted her mother\u2019s \nsavings.

She realized, during this time, that a number \nof her problems stemmed from her multiple prescription medications, \u201cbut my real \nproblems couldn\u2019t be medicated away.\u201d She testified that as of the date of the hearing, \nshe was no longer medicated or seeing multiple doctors. In 2015, at age 49, she made a \ncareer change and learned to be an OTR truck driver. In the first several years, however, \nshe continued to experience financial difficulties, because she was \u201clearning the ropes, \n[and] gaining experience at low paying, low miles.\u201d During this time, she also struggled to \nmaintain health insurance for herself and her daughter, who suffered from costly health \nissues. As of the date of the hearing, she did not have health insurance. (Tr. at 21-26, 33-\n34, 41-42, 49, 51-54, 61-62) \nIn approximately 2016, Applicant met her fianc\u00e9, and he earned approximately \n$20,000 annually as a self-employed OTR truck driver. Although they shifted their \npriorities to keep current on their essential financial obligations, which included a home, \nthey suffered another setback in 2017, when her fianc\u00e9 purchased a truck for his company \nand the truck immediately began having issues. As of the date of the hearing, they paid \napproximately $17,500 for needed truck repairs only to find out that the truck was beyond \nrepair. They purchased a newer truck one week before the hearing, through a $95,000 \nloan taken out by her fianc\u00e9 for which monthly payments of $2,400 were scheduled to \nbegin in October 2021. She estimated that she earned a minimal annual income of \napproximately $20,000 as an OTR truck driver in 2018, and she did not earn any income \nin 2019 as a result of unsuccessfully attempting to lease a truck as an owner-operator. In \naddition, she contracted COVID-19 at the onset of the pandemic and business also \nsuffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. She estimated that she earned a minimal \nannual income of $5,600 in 2020 and 2021. They also had a house fire, which destroyed \nher medical records, and she has since had difficulty retracing her creditors to try to \nreplace those records in order to address her delinquent medical debts. She testified that \nwhen she received the SOR in November 2020, \u201cI had to face how deep in debt I was \nand began to pay off some of my debt, as things started to improve at the end of the year.\u201d \n(Tr. at 21-26, 38, 40-44, 46-47, 59-63) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a $2,310 charged-off account for Applicant\u2019s car that was \nrepossessed in 2015. After she received the SOR, Applicant paid this debt in December \n2020 with financial assistance from her fianc\u00e9. The 2021 credit bureau report reflects that \nthis debt is paid. (Tr. at 42-43, 57-58; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.jj are for 35 of Applicant\u2019s delinquent medical debts, totaling \napproximately $79,444. As previously discussed, Applicant does not know what these \nmedical debts are for, as she has not been able to replace her medical records destroyed \nin her house fire. She acknowledged, as previously discussed, that she had medical debts \nfrom 2015 to 2016 related to her hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and medical \ncare for herself and her daughter. She testified that she paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.h, 1.bb, 1.cc, \n1.dd, 1.hh, and 1.ii in December 2020, after she received the SOR, and that she paid \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.o, 1.p and 1.q in January 2021.

(Tr. at 22-23, 31-35, 43-47, 49, 52-54, 57; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.kk is for an $8,588 debt placed for collection. This is for commercial \ndriver\u2019s license training that Applicant\u2019s previous employer provided her in 2016. \nApplicant has to repay her previous employer for this training because Applicant left \nemployment before the required conclusion of her one-year commitment. Applicant \ntestified that she and her fianc\u00e9 were saving to pay this debt. They had saved $1,000 as \nof the date of the hearing, and they intended to apply this savings toward resolving this \ndebt. (Tr. at 35-39) \nApplicant earned her HAZMAT certification and Transportation Worker \nIdentification Credential (TWIC) card. The former is required for drivers who will be \nhauling loads containing Department of Transportation-classified hazardous materials, \nwhile the TWIC card allows drivers to enter and travel port facilities unescorted. She \ntestified that she has learned how to make sound financial decisions and understood the \nimportance of good credit. She testified that she expected to owe $2,000 in taxes for tax \nyear 2020, and she and her fianc\u00e9 planned to pay it using money he set aside in his \nsavings. She acknowledged that she was not in a position to resolve her delinquent debts. \nHer future brother-in-law, a financial advisor, provided her with financial counseling. She \nalso developed a household budget. (Tr. at 24-26, 35-39, 47-48, 54-63) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or.\n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also\nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or\nsensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s circumstances, as previously discussed, are conditions beyond her \ncontrol that contributed to her financial problems. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) partially \napplies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted \nresponsibly under her circumstances. After she received the SOR, she paid the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.h, 1.n to 1.q, 1.bb, 1.dd, and 1.ii. Applicants who wait until their \nclearances are in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment \nexpected of those with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). I find that \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.h, 1.n to 1.q, 1.bb, \n1.dd, and 1.ii. \nApplicant has not sought professional tax assistance or debt counseling since she \nfirst encountered financial difficulties. She acknowledged that she was not in a position to \nresolve her delinquent debts. I also find that such behavior did not happen so long ago, \nwas not infrequent, and did not occur under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nIt continues to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

(Tr. at 18, 28-29, 39; \nGE 1-5) The SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts. However, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.r are duplicate accounts. The 17 non-duplicative debts consist of seven defaulted \nstudent loans to the U.S. Department of Education totaling $13,782; two medical debts \ntotaling $578; a deficiency balance of $7,165 owed on an auto loan after the vehicle \nwas repossessed; and seven miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling $7,267. \nApplicant started paying her debts after she obtained her current job. She paid \nseveral debts before the SOR was issued, including debts that were not alleged in the \nSOR. (Tr. at 20; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, B, D, H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges a $158 delinquent debt to a collection company on behalf of a \nfinancial institution. The debt is listed by all three credit reporting agencies on the March \n2019 credit report, with an activity date of February 2019. Applicant indicated that she \nhad two accounts with the same collection company and financial institutions (only one \nwas alleged in the SOR), and she paid $400 on January 3, 2019, and $321 on February \n1, 2019, to resolve both debts. She provided documented proof of the $400 payment on \nJanuary 3, 2019. The two later credit reports do not list either debt. I find that Applicant \nowed $721 on the two accounts, and both of the accounts have been paid. (Tr. at 36-\n37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, H) \nApplicant asserted that she paid the $2,224 and $750 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.k and 1.l) owed to a collection company on behalf of the same creditor. She provided \ntwo copies of documentation that the $750 account was paid by June 2019. Both \naccounts were reported by all three credit reporting agencies on the March 2019 \ncombined credit report, with activity dates for both accounts of March 2016. The debts \nare not listed on the December 2019 or June 2021 Equifax credit reports. The debts did \nnot \u201cage off\u201d the reports because they were not past the seven-year reporting window. I \nfind that both debts have been paid. (Tr. at 36-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-\n5; AE B, E) \nApplicant paid the $211 telecommunications debt (SOR \u00b6 1.n) in August 2019. \nShe paid the $1,577 charged-off furniture debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) in April 2020. She asserted \nthat she paid the $368 and $210 medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.o) and the $147 \npublic utilities debt (SOR \u00b6 1.q). She did not provide supporting documentation, \nexplaining that she changed financial institutions and no longer had access to all of her \nrecords. The debts are listed on the March 2019 credit report, but not the two most \nrecent credit reports.

She is to pay at least $50 per \nmonth. She had not made the first payment when the record closed. The seven student \nloans are in a pause mandated for all federal student loans through at least September \n2022. Because she is currently attending college, she will likely receive a deferment \nafter the pause ends. (Tr. at 29-30, 34-36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $7,145 charged-off auto loan. The vehicle was purchased \nand financed in about April 2013. It is unclear when it was repossessed, but Applicant \nstated that she thought it was in about 2014 or 2015. The March 2019 credit report \nindicated that $7,875 was charged off in October 2013, with a balance of $7,415. The \nDecember 2019 credit report indicated the account was charged off, with a high credit of \n$14,869, a date of last action (DLA) of January 2015, and a balance of $7,165. The \nJune 2021 credit report indicated that $14,869 was charged off (this amount does not \nadd up, and is contradicted by the previous reports), with a balance of $7,165. (Tr. at \n31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5) \nApplicant\u2019s finances have greatly improved. She has a good job at a major \ncompany that pays her well. If she receives a security clearance, her opportunities at \nthe company will increase. Her child is an adult. She has not let any new debts become \ndelinquent since before she started her job in 2018. With tuition assistance from her \nemployer, she is paying for her current college education as she goes, without taking \nout additional student loans. She received financial advice from a counselor at her \ncollege. (Tr. at 19-20, 29-30, 40-41; GE 2-4) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nFebruary 2019. She did not report any adverse information under the financial \nquestions. She credibly denied intentionally providing false information about her \nfinances. She inquired about how to fill out the questionnaire because there were things \nthat she did not remember. She was told to do the best she could, and if anything came \nup in the investigation, it would be brought to her attention. At the time she submitted \nthe SF 86, she had already paid two of the SOR debts and several non-SOR debts. A \nnumber of the other debts were old. After considering all of the evidence, including \nApplicant\u2019s age, education, experience, and credible testimony, I find she did not \nintentionally provide false information about her finances on the SF 86. (Tr. at 18-25, 34, \n36; GE 1) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.r allege duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005). SOR \u00b6 1.r is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to unemployment, underemployment, \nand being a single parent. She began paying her debts before she received the SOR. \nHer student loans are on hold, and she is currently attending college without taking out \nadditional loans. She has a good job at a major company that pays her well. If she \nreceives a security clearance, her opportunities at the company will increase. She has \nnot let any new debts become delinquent since before she started her job in 2018. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a plan to resolve her financial problems, and she took significant \naction to implement that plan. She acted responsibly under the circumstances and \nmade a good-faith effort to pay her debts. Her finances do not cast doubt on her current \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not report any adverse information under the financial questions on \nher February 2019 SF 86. After considering all of the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nage, education, experience, and credible testimony, I find she did not intentionally falsify \nthe SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. Personal conduct security concerns are \nconcluded for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns, and she mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Because the United States is a leader \nin the development of new technologies and a central player in global financial and \ntrade networks, foreign attempts to collect U.S. technological and economic information \nwill continue at a high level and will represent a growing and persistent threat to the \nU.S. economic security.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) This \nallegation, which he admitted, is established by his July 15, 2019 SF-86; his August 23, \n2019 Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI); his \nDecember 15, 2020 Response to DOHA Interrogatories; and his undated SOR Answer. \n(GE 1 through 3; SOR Answer; Tr. 1 at 11) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: In his SOR Answer, Applicant explained his failure to timely file his \nFederal income tax returns as follows: \nDuring my employment at [previous employer] (Aug 2015 to Feb 2019), I \nelected for maximum allowances on my form W4 beginning in 2016. This \nwas due to a misguided concept to allocate the otherwise withheld portion \nof my paycheck into a split between high interest yielding account and \nsecurities for the tax year term. The methodology was to accrue savings \nand investment interest on the earmarked money, then liquidate and pay \nback owed taxes to the IRS. This of course did not take into account \npenalties due to misrepresenting W4 allowances, risk from securities \ninvestment, taxed owed on short term capital gains, and of course the \nfinancial ethics of the situation. This pattern occurred from 2016 until the \nend of my employment with [previous employer] and partially into my \nemployment with [current employer] (approximately May 2019). (SOR \nAnswer) \nApplicant further stated that after beginning his current employment that it \nbecame apparent to him that he needed to revise his withholdings strategy and resolve \nhis income tax situation. He stated that he had retained the services of a certified public \naccountant (CPA) in February 2020; however, \u201cafter the onset of the pandemic, we had \nindividually gotten distracted with personal affairs and lost touch with the process.\u201d \n(SOR Answer) After Applicant began working for his current employer, he retained the \nservices of another CPA and stated that he was collecting the necessary documentation \nto file his back tax returns: \u201cMy tax advisor and I are currently working on . . . all of my \ntax returns in order to bring me up to date with the IRS.\u201d (SOR Answer) He concluded \nhis Answer by stating that he would present tax filing documents at his DOHA hearing. \nApplicant explained when his continued hearing reconvened that he had retained \na CPA only a week before (in June 2021): He clarified that despite \u201cthe Tax \nEngagement Letter that I received from [the CPA], I have yet to actually retain them \nwith. But that is where we\u2019re at in the process right now.\u201d (Tr. 1 at 9-14) At his August \n12, 2021 hearing, when asked about the progress he made in filing his delinquent \nincome tax returns, Applicant stated: \nAs far as my accounting firm is concerned, they are basically almost done \nwith it.

That\u2019s the update I received earlier. I had a look at the tax returns \nfor years 2016, \u201917, \u201918. As far as the amount owed, they saw mine with \nmy estimates that I originally disclosed in the original interrogation which \nwere approximately $7,000 per tax year from 2016 to 2018. (Tr. 2 at 8) \nWhen asked about the status of his 2019 and 2020 income tax returns, Applicant \nstated that his CPA was going to bring those income tax returns up to date. Applicant \nestimated that he would owe \u201cabout $41,000 to $43,000\u201d in past-due federal income \ntaxes for tax years 2016 to 2020, requiring him to set up a payment plan with the IRS. \nHe acknowledged that his employer, a defense contractor, derives their revenue at least \nin part from money collected from taxes. Applicant was unsure when he would be able \nto reach an agreement with the IRS regarding a payment plan. (Tr. 2 at 8-14) \nIn short, as of the date the record closed, Applicant had not filed his income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 through 2018. His returns for tax years 2019 and 2020 are \nalso unfiled. \nForeign Influence \nThe SOR lists one allegation under this concern as a result of Applicant having \nfamily connections in India. Applicant\u2019s family connections are established by his July \n15, 2019 SF-86; his August 23, 2019 Office of Personnel Management Personal \nSubject Interview (OPM PSI); his December 15, 2020 Response to DOHA \nInterrogatories; and his undated SOR Answer. (GE 1 through 3; SOR Answer.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a \u2013 Applicant\u2019s grandmother, several aunts, uncles and cousins \nare citizens and residents of India. Applicant admitted the relatives as alleged, but \ndenied that they are a Guideline B national security concern. In his SOR Answer, he \nprovided the following information regarding his relatives in India: \n. . . in the interests of addressing these concerns very precisely, any \nconversations I have had in the past with my extended family consist of \ntopics of conversation limited to health of myself and my family members \nand what hobbies I am interested and pursuing of late. The primary \nreason for the limited extent of our conversations is due to the language \nbarrier. I personally speak the native language of my extended family, \nTelugu, at a 1st  grade level and cannot read or write. My extended family \nsimilarly has very limited English fluency. Beyond that, there is never any \nmention of work or subjects remotely relating to my work. (SOR Answer) \nApplicant speaks \u201cvery infrequently\u201d to his grandmother, aunts, uncles, and \ncousins in India. He does not send them any money. He said his relationship with them \nwould not have any effect on his ability to protect national security.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control,\njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets\nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive\npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines\nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 \n19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the potential application of any mitigation \nconditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nNone of the mitigating conditions under this concern apply. As of the date the \nrecord closed, Applicant had not filed his income tax returns for 2016 through 2018, \nwhich were alleged, nor had he filed 2019 and 2020 income tax returns, which were not \nalleged. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his tax returns for 2016 through 2018 is further \nexacerbated by his failure to timely file his tax returns for 2019 and 2020. He estimated \nthat he owes \u201cabout $41,000 to $43,000\u201d for tax years 2016 to 2020. Furthermore, \nApplicant did not offer any plausible acceptable explanation to justify his failure to file \nhis tax returns or that his inability to do so was beyond his control. Although he hired a \nCPA to assist him in filing his tax returns, there are no clear indications that his tax \nproblems are resolved or under control. The evidence demonstrates that Applicant did \nnot act responsibly with regard to timely filing his Federal income tax returns and paying \nor making payment arrangements for taxes owed. \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016, \n2017, and 2018. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a \nfederal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . .. \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when \nrequired, is a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v.\nUnited States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir.\n1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States,\n51 F.2d 193 (7th  Cir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to timely file his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. \n \n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn regard to the failure to timely file Federal income tax returns when due, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  \nApplying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, SOR \u00b6 1.a is not mitigated. Applicant \nfailed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 to 2018, as alleged. \nNor did he pay his tax that he owed for this period. Under all the circumstances, he \nfailed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about foreign influence as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant was born, raised, and educated in the United States. His immediate \nfamily members, consisting of his mother, father, and older brother, were all born in \nIndia, but became naturalized citizens after moving to the United States. He \ncommunicates with his immediate family \u201cmost days\u201d in contrast to infrequent contact \nwith his grandmother, aunts, uncles and cousins in India. Applicant has visited India a \ntotal of three times in 1998, 2003, and 2016. He does not own any property or have any \nfinancial connections in India. Any financial holdings that Applicant has are in the United \nStates. \nApplicant\u2019s relatives in India including his grandmother, several aunts, uncles and \ncousins, with whom he has what can be described as superficial infrequent contact. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, \ntheir immediate family members. Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are all in the \nUnited States, with whom he has frequent contact. See ISCR Case No. 01-03120, (App. \nBd. Feb. 20, 2002). In addition, Applicant has familial ties of affection to some relatives \nin India even though his communications with them are infrequent. \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his relatives in India create a concern about his \n\u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology\u201d and his desire to help relatives \nliving in India. For example, if terrorists, government officials, or other entities in India \nwanted to expose Applicant to coercion, they could exert pressure on his relatives living \nin India. Applicant would then be subject to coercion through his connections to India \nand classified information could potentially be compromised. \nAn applicant\u2019s ties with his family members in India, are not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant has a close relationship with \neven one relative, living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation.

The evidence did not present any particular \nrelative in India with whom Applicant has what can be described as a close relationship. \nHowever, cumulatively the fact that Applicant has relatives who are close to his parents, \nwith whom he does have a close relationship, could create a situation of heightened \nrisk. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United \nStates. The relationship of India with the United States, places some, but not an \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his family \nmembers\u2019 relationships with family members living in India do not pose a security risk. \nApplicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist relatives in India. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n(App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives or terrorists from India \nseek or have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, his \nrelatives living in India, nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and India has a problem with \nterrorism. Applicant and his relationships, notably through his parents, with family \nmembers living in India create a potential conflict of interest because these relationships \nare sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to assist relatives in \nIndia by providing sensitive or classified information. Department Counsel produced \nsubstantial evidence of Applicant and his immediate family members\u2019 relationships with \ntheir family living in India. Department Counsel has raised the issue of potential foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation. The record establishes the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). Further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any \nmitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists three conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security \nconcerns including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) have applicability. Applicant has infrequent and superficial \ncontact with several relatives living in India. Loyalty to, support for, and connections to \nfamily are positive character traits. However, for security clearance purposes, those \nsame relationships negate the possibility of full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), and \nApplicant failed to fully meet his burden of showing there is little likelihood that his \nrelationships with relatives in India could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant \nconnections to the United States. Applicant is a U.S.-born citizen and was raised and \neducated in the United States. He is employed by a defense contractor. Any financial \ninvestments that he has are in the United States. He does not have dual citizenship with \nIndia nor does he have any rights in India vis-\u00e0-vis his family members. He exercises \nhis rights as a U.S. citizen to include voting in U.S. elections. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with family living in India. There \nis no evidence, however, that terrorists, criminals, the Indian Government, or those \nconducting espionage have approached or threatened Applicant, his immediate family \nmembers living in the United States, or their relatives living in India to coerce Applicant \nfor classified or sensitive information. As such, there is a reduced possibility that \nApplicant, or their relatives living in India or the United States would be specifically \nselected as targets for improper coercion or exploitation. Of course, the primary risk to \ntheir relatives living in India is from terrorists and other lawless elements and not the \nIndian Government. \nWhile the U.S. Government does not have any burden to prove the presence of \nsuch evidence, if such record evidence were present, Applicant would have a heavier \nevidentiary burden to mitigate foreign influence security concerns. It is important to be \nmindful of the United States\u2019 sizable financial and diplomatic investment in India. \nApplicant and his immediate family\u2019s relatives living in India could become potential \ntargets of terrorists because of Applicant\u2019s support for the United States, and Applicant\u2019s \npotential access to classified information could theoretically add some risk to them from \nlawless elements in India. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn sum, Applicant connections to his relatives living in India are not significant. \nHe traveled to India only three times in 1998, 2003, and 2016.

The only financial connections that Applicant has \nare in the United States. Foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the \nAnalysis section under Guidelines F and B is incorporated in this whole-person section. \nHowever, further comments are warranted. \nTo review, Applicant is a 29-year-old experienced electrical design engineer, who \nhas been employed by a defense contractor since August 2020. He seeks to obtain a \nsecurity clearance to enhance his position within his company. Having been awarded a \nbachelor of science degree in electrical engineering, he continues to better himself by \npursuing a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He has all the indicators of an \nupwardly mobile individual with a bright future ahead of him. \nAs noted, Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence concerns. However, he \nhas failed to grasp the importance of one of the fundamental hallmarks of U.S. \ncitizenship, which is the timely filing of his income tax returns and paying taxes when \ndue. This is especially crucial for an individual seeking a security clearance, who plans \nto work for a defense contractor, a defense contractor who advances the national \nsecurity of the United States. From the evidence presented, despite being made aware \nthat the timely filing of his Federal income tax returns and payment of his taxes was a \nsecurity concern, Applicant failed to grasp the importance of this basic and fundamental \ncivic obligation. He is certainly a bright and talented individual, who is more than \ncapable of addressing his income tax problems in a responsible way. Hopefully in the \nnear future, Applicant will heed the outcome of this decision as motivation to address \n13 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nthese concerns and achieve the level of financial stability required for national security \neligibility. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraph 1.a: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Subparagraph 2.a: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

(Items 3, 7) \nThe SOR concerns several years of unfiled Federal income tax returns, a \ndelinquent tax debt, and one unpaid medical debt. The allegations are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence. \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA, that he failed to file his 2016 \u2013 2018 Federal \nincome tax returns. In addressing his unfiled tax returns, Applicant stated that he had a \nbalance due with the IRS, and that the IRS had kept his refunds to address it. He stated \nthat he intended to file his past-due tax returns after the resolution of the debt. Applicant \nalso stated that he sought pro-bono representation to resolve this debt, but was \nunsuccessful. (Item 3) \nApplicant submitted tax account records in response to an interrogatory. Those \ntax account transcripts show that as of November 2020, his 2016 return was unfiled and \nhis 2017 and 2018 returns were filed late. In his answer to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a & 1.b, Applicant \nstated that he filed all of his overdue tax returns in May and August of 2020, and was \ndue a refund for each year. Notwithstanding his admission to SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant\u2019s \n2019 return was filed on time. (Items 2, 3, 4, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c concerns $12,607 in past-due Federal income taxes from tax year \n2011. This is established by Applicant\u2019s IRS account balance, submitted with his \ninterrogatory response, and by his admission. He stated that he incurred this debt \nbecause of a 401K withdrawal due to unemployment, and that he used the funds to \nprovide for his family. He stated that the IRS had told him this debt was in a \u201cdo not \ncollect\u201d status in 2012. He stated that he did not make any payments on this debt to \nprevent \u201ctaking funds from my family,\u201d and that he had relied on the fact that the IRS \nkept his subsequent tax refunds to reduce his tax debt. However, Applicant reported in \nhis SCA that he was divorced in 2008, and has no children. (Items 2, 3, 4, 7) \nFurther, Applicant did not indicate any periods of unemployment since 1996 on \nhis SCA. While he changed jobs in 2011, he provided no information to show that his \nfinancial situation dramatically changed. The record also indicates that he has been \ngainfully employed, with his current employer, since 2013. Despite this, Applicant \nprovided no evidence of any payments towards his past-due Federal tax debt from tax \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyear 2011. Applicant provided no information more recent than his interrogatory \nresponse regarding the status of this debt. (Items 2, 3, 4, 7) \nApplicant\u2019s tax account transcripts also show a history of delinquent Federal \nincome tax debts for other, earlier tax years, going back to 2006. Those debts were \nresolved through involuntary refund offsets from tax years 2015, 2017, and 2018, and \nnot through Applicant\u2019s own active efforts. Having been resolved previously, they are \nnot alleged in the SOR. Since Applicant did not respond to the FORM, he did not \nprovide any updated information about the current status of his Federal tax debt and the \nunfiled 2016 tax return. (Item 4)   \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, which Applicant denied, is an unpaid $146 medical debt. It is listed on \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 and 2020 credit reports as being unpaid since at least 2015. While he \nclaims it was paid in 2019, he did not provide any corroborating documentation. (Items \n2, 5, 6, 7)    \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to timely file his Federal income tax returns, a \nhistory of unpaid tax debt, and one past-due medical debt. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. Applicant\u2019s 2019 income tax return was filed on \ntime, and no disqualifying condition applies to that return. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s medical debt is minor and is not part of the larger pattern of \ndelinquent tax issues. I conclude that SOR \u00b6 1.d has been resolved, and in any event is \nnot a security concern. \nApplicant failed to file his 2016, 2017, and 2018 Federal tax returns on time, as \nrequired. While his 2017 and 2018 returns have been filed, they were filed in mid-2020, \nseveral years late. Applicant did not provide any evidence that his 2016 Federal tax \nreturn has been filed. His $12,607 past-due tax debt from tax year 2011 is also \nunresolved and ongoing. Applicant has a history of noncompliance with tax filing \nrequirements, and has had unpaid tax debt for many years. His issues with timely tax \nfilings and payments are frequent, not isolated, and they are ongoing. He did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some application to Applicant\u2019s 2011 tax debt, since he appears \nto have incurred the debt during a period of employment instability. However, that debt \nis now many years old, and Applicant did not establish that he ever undertook \nresponsible action in the years since to address it, despite gainful employment in his \ncurrent job since 2013. He did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 \n20(b) should apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is also no record evidence to establish that Applicant made any voluntary \npayments on his 2011 tax debt. The record indicates that Applicant\u2019s pattern is to wait \nfor the IRS to address his tax debts by keeping his subsequent refunds. This does not \nconstitute either reasonable action or good-faith efforts. AGs \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nThe fact that Applicant belatedly filed his 2017 and 2018 tax returns is not \nsufficient to apply AG \u00b6 20(g). He has significant, and quite dated Federal income tax \ndebt, and has not established that he has filed his 2016 tax return. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not \napply. \nTimely filing of Federal income tax returns and paying taxes owed is a basic duty \nfor U.S. citizens, and is required by law. While Applicant is requesting that the \nGovernment entrust him with access to national security information, he has failed to \nmeet his basic tax filing and payment obligations. The Appeal Board has held that \u201ca \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the \nprotection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information as reflected in the Guideline F concerns that were \nalleged.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015)). \nThere is insufficient evidence to find that Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with his tax \nfiling and payment obligations are now resolved. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ntaxes. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \nrelated to his taxes are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \nApplicant did not provide any tax documents with his SOR response, and also \ndid not respond to the FORM, so he did not provide more recent evidence to mitigate \nhis late-filed tax returns or past-due tax debt. In addition, since Applicant did not request \na hearing, I did not have the opportunity to question him about his financial issues, or to \nassess his credibility by observing his demeanor. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He pleaded guilty, and the court ordered him to attend anger management \nclasses. (Id.) After completion of all sentencing requirements, the record was sealed and \nexpunged. (Tr. 29) \nTo summarize, from 1999 to November 2003, Applicant was arrested for four DUIs. \nHe consumed excessive amounts of alcohol for several years during this period because \nof the stress and shock related to the end of his nine-year marriage in 1998. (Tr. 20, 30) \nHe did not have any problems with alcohol for eight years (2003-2011). He was always \nalone in his vehicle when the police stopped him for DUIs. (Tr. 53) \nApplicant relapsed in 2011 when his father passed away and due to a toxic\nromantic relationship. (Tr. 20, 37) From 2011 to 2016, he had five alcohol-related arrests \nand an alcohol-related probation violation. (Tr. 38) After his most recent DUI arrest in \n2016, he attended several outpatient alcohol counseling and treatment programs. (Tr. 44-\n45) He ended the toxic relationship, and he does not associate with the people who \nconsumed alcohol with him during the 2011 to 2016 time period. (Tr. 20) The police have \nnot arrested him since 2016. (Tr. 20) He attends faith-based meetings in a 12-step \nprogram, which is similar to the 12-step program in the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nprogram. (Tr. 21, 46-48) He accepted that he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 21) He does not intend \nto consume alcohol in the future. (Tr. 22) He denied that he was impaired at work by \nalcohol consumption. (Tr. 31, 53) \n \nApplicant does not believe future incidents involving the police and courts will occur \nbecause he admitted his problem with alcohol, and he took action to address it. (Tr. 23) \nIn 2003, and June 2007, he completed the ASAP training courses. (AE E) In April 2018, \nhe successfully completed an intensive outpatient treatment program.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nFour alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(d), and 22(g) provide: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(d), and 22(g) are established. The SOR alleges nine \nalcohol-related incidents involving the police and courts (includes probation violation, but\nnot unalleged DUI). Applicant was arrested or charged in 1999, 2003 (twice), 2011, 2012,\n2013, 2015 (twice), and 2016 for alcohol-related offenses. Although the term \u201cbinge\u201d\ndrinking is not defined in the Directive, his .17 BAC is at a high enough level to establish\nApplicant engaged in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment. He\nwas diagnosed with alcohol dependence in 2018, which is equivalent to a diagnosis of\nalcohol use disorder. Compare the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(DSM) 4th  Edition (alcohol dependence) with DSM 5 (alcohol use disorder). He served\ntwo days in jail for testing positive for alcohol, in violation of his probation.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFour alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-23(d) are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nOver the last 20 years, Applicant attended multiple alcohol education, counseling, \nand treatment programs. From 2003 to 2011, he was sober. During this eight-year period, \nhe did not have any alcohol-related incidents involving the police or courts. \nIn addition, Applicant had one DUI in August 2000, which the SOR failed to list. \nThe August 2000 DUI will only be considered as it relates to evaluating mitigation. See \nISCR Case No. 20-01577 at 3 (App. Bd. June 6, 2022) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (listing the purposes for which non-alleged conduct can be \nconsidered)). \nApplicant completed alcohol-related classes during the 1999 to 2003 time period, \nand he was sober from 2003 to 2011, a period of eight years. In 2011, Applicant resumed \nhis alcohol consumption. From 2011 to 2016, he was arrested or charged six times for \nalcohol-related criminal offenses (includes a probation violation). His repeated alcohol \noffenses occurred despite the alcohol education, counseling, and therapy sessions that \nhe completed prior to 2011. His multiple alcohol-related criminal offenses from 2011 to \n2016 are relatively recent. Applicant believes the stressors in 2011 related to the death \nof his father and a bad romantic relationship caused him to relapse. In the future, he may \nsuffer similar stressors. \nThe April 2018 IOP clinical recommendation was for Applicant \u201cto consistently \nattend Outpatient Treatment (individual and group) for relapse prevention purposes and \nto continue to build a sober support system.\u201d (GE 4 at 8) The October 2018 discharge \nsummary said \u201cDiscontinuing treatment against advice.\u201d (Id. at 1) Instead, Applicant \nelected to continue to attend a 12-step counseling program. He has stated that he \nrefrained from alcohol consumption from November 2016 to present; however, under all \nthe circumstances, there is insufficient time without alcohol consumption to fully establish \nmitigation. I have lingering concerns about a relapse and additional alcohol-related \nproblems. Alcohol consumption security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(d) are established for the reasons stated in the alcohol \nconsumption section. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. He received job \ntraining and counseling; he obtained higher education; he successfully completed a \ncareer in the Army, including a combat tour in Afghanistan. His resume indicates he has \nachieved substantial professional development. He has two master\u2019s degrees. His \nalcohol-related offenses ended in 2016. He said he ended his alcohol consumption in \nNovember 2016. \nThe 2008 domestic violence arrest did not involve alcohol. No other similar \noffenses not involving alcohol occurred. This offense is isolated and not recent. No one \nwas injured. The court subsequently dismissed the charge and sealed the record. The \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b is mitigated. \nAs discussed in the alcohol consumption section, Applicant\u2019s other arrests and \nconvictions from 1999 to 2016 remain relevant as they show a pattern of disregarding \nlaws and legal requirements. The offenses show serious lapses of judgment. They are \nalcohol-related. There is insufficient proof of rehabilitation. The totality of circumstances \ncontinues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nCriminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines G and \nJ are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 59-year-old Principle Specialist in Program Management for a direct \nsupport DOD contractor who has supported the Army at an arsenal for 15 years. He has \nworked as an engineer for 26 years. He has a master\u2019s degree in engineering and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in business administration. From 2004 to 2005, he served a 12-month \ntour in Afghanistan. He received numerous Army awards and medals. He is a major in \nthe Army Retired Reserve, and he honorably served in the military for 23 years. His \nresume provides additional information about his professional experiences and training. \nHe has held a security clearance since 1983. There is no evidence of security violations. \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 and 2020 performance evaluations indicate he \u201cSurpasses \nExpectations.\u201d (AE G) His coworkers, including a supervisor, and retired field grade \nofficers lauded his diligence, trustworthiness, professionalism, and dedication to work and \nto his daughter. The character evidence supports continued access to classified \ninformation. \nChanges in Applicant\u2019s life, including the end of a toxic romantic relationship, and \nhis rehabilitative efforts evidence a positive trend in his life. He has been educated about \nthe risks of continued alcohol consumption for him. He has acknowledged that he is an \nalcoholic, and he has elected to refrain from all alcohol consumption. He has not been \narrested since 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests, charges, and convictions from 1999 to 2003 \nand 2011 to 2016 show a pattern of disregarding laws and legal requirements.

He denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c., and 1.e. Applicant is 37 years old and unmarried. He graduated from high school in 2002, and subsequently earned an associate\u2019s degree in electronics. He has two children, one with his former girlfriend A, and one with his former girlfriend B. He enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in 2003 and was honorably discharged in 2007. He held a security clearance while in the Marines. (Tr. 17-19, 39) After his discharge, he worked in construction from 2007 to 2013. He worked for a defense contractor in the Middle East from about 2015 to 2017. He then started a cruise business with a friend, which he closed in 2018 due to financial problems. In September 2019, he submitted a security clearance application for a job with a different defense contractor and anticipated returning to the Middle East when he received a security clearance. (GE 1, GE 4; AE D) On December 25, 2020, Applicant became embroiled in a serious physical argument with his former girlfriend B. It became violent and the police were called. He was arrested and charged with aggravated battery, a felony. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was immediately incarcerated. He served 13 months in prison and was released on January 19, 2022. He is on supervised probation for three years and is required to attend counseling, anger management and parenting classes. (Tr. 20",

Applicant did not \nobject to the motion. (Tr. 42-43) The two allegations are as follows: \nGuideline F: Add Paragraph 1.i to read as follows: You failed to file, as required, \nstate and federal tax returns for tax years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. As of the date of \nthis hearing the tax returns remain unfiled. (Tr. 37, 42-43) \nAdd Guideline J: Paragraph 2.a: In December 2020, you were arrested and \ncharged with aggravated battery, a felony. You pleaded guilty and served approximately \n13 months in jail. (Tr. 19, 42) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, \n1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. He denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c., and 1.e. \nApplicant is 37 years old and unmarried. He graduated from high school in 2002, \nand subsequently earned an associate\u2019s degree in electronics. He has two children, one \nwith his former girlfriend A, and one with his former girlfriend B. He enlisted in the Marine \nCorps Reserve in 2003 and was honorably discharged in 2007. He held a security \nclearance while in the Marines. (Tr. 17-19, 39) After his discharge, he worked in \nconstruction from 2007 to 2013. He worked for a defense contractor in the Middle East \nfrom about 2015 to 2017. He then started a cruise business with a friend, which he closed \nin 2018 due to financial problems. In September 2019, he submitted a security clearance \napplication for a job with a different defense contractor and anticipated returning to the \nMiddle East when he received a security clearance. (GE 1, GE 4; AE D) \nOn December 25, 2020, Applicant became embroiled in a serious physical \nargument with his former girlfriend B. It became violent and the police were called. He \nwas arrested and charged with aggravated battery, a felony. He pleaded guilty to the \ncharge and was immediately incarcerated. He served 13 months in prison and was \nreleased on January 19, 2022. He is on supervised probation for three years and is \nrequired to attend counseling, anger management and parenting classes. (Tr. 20-25) \nSince his release from prison, Applicant has been working as a forklift operator \nand is not earning enough money to resolve his debts. He is trying to repair his credit by \nremoving negative inquiries. (Tr. 26-27) He said he lost a lot of money when he had his \ncruise business between 2017 and 2018, which accounts for some of his delinquent \ndebts. He would like to find a job in the trucking industry that pays more money and would \nallow him to resolve debts. He lives with girlfriend A and their child.

(GE 2, GE 3) Applicant said he sent letters to all of his creditors \na week before the hearing. requesting information about the alleged debts, but had not \nreceived a response as of the hearing date. (Tr. 29, 34) The status of each debt is as \nfollows: \n1. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $901 is owed to Midland for a delinquent credit card. \nIt is unresolved. (Tr. 28.) \n2. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $1,127 is owed to Midland for a delinquent credit \ncard. Applicant denied owing it because he does not have any recollection of \nit. He would pay it if it is his debt. It is unresolved. (Tr. 28.) \n3. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $2,896 is owed to Midland for a delinquent credit \ncard. Applicant denied owing this debt because he believes it is a duplicate of \none of the above two debts. He would pay it if it is his debt. It is unresolved. (Tr. \n29; AE O) \n4. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $1,340 is owed to a retail store. He recently sent a \nletter to the creditor about resolving it. It is unresolved. (Tr. 31) \n5. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $1,509 is owed to a credit card company. Applicant \ndenied owing the debt because he believes he paid it. It is unresolved. (Tr. 31) \n6. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $47,035 is owed to a company for a car loan. The car \nhas not been repossessed and Applicant continues to use it. The debt was \ncharged off in 2018. It is unresolved. (Tr. 31-33; GE 2) \n7. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $2,886 is owed to a credit card company. It is \nunresolved. (Tr. 34) \n8. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h for $35,488 is owed to a bank for a credit card. It is \nunresolved.

He believes some alleged debts are not his responsibility. (AE P, AE Q, AE \nR). \nApplicant admitted that he failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for \nyears 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. (Tr. 38) They remain unfiled. \nApplicant submitted copies of letters of recommendation that he submitted to the \ncriminal court in August 2021 for purposes of obtaining a recognizance bond hearing.

They stated that the criminal incident with girlfriend B \nwas out of character for him. (AE B, AE C, AE E, AE F, AE G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline lists conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts and experienced financial problems, \nwhich began in 2018 and continue into the present. He failed to file federal and state \nincome tax returns for years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) \napply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing and attributable to his failed business \nin 2018 and his 13-month incarceration from late 2020 to early 2022. While his business \nproblems may have been a circumstance beyond his control, his incarceration was not. \nHe did not address his financial problems before he went to jail. After his release he made \nmodest efforts to contact creditors, but there is no evidence he paid or resolved any of \nthe alleged debts. There is no evidence that he participated in credit or budget counseling \nor indications that his debts or taxes are being resolved or under control. Applicant did \nnot present sufficient evidence that any of the debts he disputed are not his responsibility; \nhowever, he indicated that he intended to pay those that are his responsibility. He did not \nsubmit documentation that he has made arrangements with the taxing authorities to file \nhis tax returns. The evidence does not establish mitigation under any of the above \nmitigating conditions. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern related to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn December 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated battery, \na felony. He pleaded guilty and served approximately 13 months in jail. He was released \nin January 2022. The evidence establishes both of the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish the above mitigating conditions. In \nJanuary 2022, Applicant was released from incarceration and placed on probation for \nthree years. Since his release, he has been working and investigating his delinquent \ndebts. While those are positive factors, sufficient time has not passed since Applicant\u2019s \nfelony conviction to establish successful rehabilitation under the above two mitigating \nconditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s service in the Marines and his favorable character evidence. However, at this \ntime, the record evidence does not resolve my concerns about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He did not mitigate the security concerns raised under \nthe financial considerations and criminal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \n Against Applicant \n \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:  \n  Subparagraph 2.a:\nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 45-year-old civilian employee of a defense contractor who seeks continuation of her security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Background Applicant married in August 2001.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant mitigated \nfinancial considerations concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to \nhold a sensitive position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 7, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 14, 2021, and elected to have her \ncase decided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Applicant received \nthe File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 16, 2021 and interposed no \nobjections to the materials in the FORM. Within the time permitted, Applicant \nsupplemented the record with updated information about her student loans. Applicant\u2019s \npost-FORM submission is admitted as Items 6-8 without objection.  \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated (a) six delinquent student \nloan debts exceeding $54,000 and (b) two consumer debts (inclusive of a judgment) \nexceeding $11,000. Allegedly, the listed delinquent debts in the SOR remain unresolved \nand outstanding. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant denied having any delinquent student \nloans. She claimed she could neither admit nor deny the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and \n1.h. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 45-year-old civilian employee of a defense contractor who seeks \ncontinuation of her security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and \nadopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in August 2001. She has two children and one step-child from \nthis marriage. (GE 3) She earned an associate\u2019s degree in March 2011 and a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in August 2012 from the same university.

(GE 3) Between January 2008 and May 2015, she worked \nfor other defense contractors in various positions. She has held a security clearance \nsince approximately October 1998. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween August 2010 and January 2012, Applicant took out six student loans \nwith the lender holding student loan accounts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f. (Items 4-5) \nThese student loans are comprised of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($10,860); 1.b ($12,126); 1.c \n($6,104); 1.d ($11,556); 1.e ($6,949); and 1.f ($7,458).

(Item 7) In anticipation of her loans \nbeing returned to regular payment status, Applicant initiated making regular monthly \npayments between November 2020 and May 2021, and is credited with total payments \nfor this period of $4,800. (Item 7)   \nBesides her student loans, Applicant incurred two other delinquent debts \nbetween August 2017 and December 2019. One of the debts involved a default \njudgment entered against herself and her husband in March 2020 (covered by SOR \u00b6, \n1.g). This entered judgment reportedly arose from her husband\u2019s car accident and his \nfailure to resolve the financing charges still owing on the vehicle in reported amount of \n$10,638. (Item 6) Applicant documented her removal as a responsible party on the \nentered judgment. (Item 8) She provided no additional information covering her SOR \u00b6 \n1.h delinquent $864 debt on a credit card account opened in 2014. It is a reported old \ncredit card debt for claimed attorneys fees that Applicant apparently disputes. While the \ndebt quite possibly has been charged off by the creditor, it remains listed in Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report as a delinquent debt. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese AGs guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                       \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n  Financial Considerations \n \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is  \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage.

The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying conditions of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for financial considerations apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: \nDC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security \nclearance that entitles the person to access classified and sensitive information. While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding a sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following \nrules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position.

Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s reported history of financial difficulties associated with her delinquent \nstudent loans and two delinquent consumer debt accruals raise initial concerns over her \nability to manage her finances in a responsible and reliable way. Applicant addresses \nthose concerns in her post-FORM submissions. \nAfforded opportunities to provide clarification of the debts reported to be \ndelinquent in her credit reports and court records, Applicant provided convincing \ndocumentation that her reported delinquent loans were consolidated and placed in \nforbearance in 2020 with credited current balances. Further documentation furnished by \nApplicant credited her with resolving the 2020 default judgment debt charged to her in \ncourt records. At this point, only the SOR \u00b6 1.h debt remains unresolved \nApplicable mitigating conditions (MCs) are: \u00b6\u00b6 MC 19(a), \u201cthe behavior happened \nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness\u201d; \nand MC 19)(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Based on the pertinent documentation \nfurnished by Applicant, safe predictive assessments can be made that Applicant can \nmaintain her finances at stable levels consistent with minimum requirements for holding \na security clearance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her accrued delinquent student loan and other debts and her \nfailure to sufficiently address them heretofore are otherwise compatible with DoD \nrequirements for holding a security clearance. Factors to be considered are covered by \n\u00b6 2(d) of the Directive. \nBased on the evidence produced in the record, Applicant merits credit for both \nher contributions to the defense industry and her resolving her student loan and \njudgment debts. Leaving only one small debt unresolved, Applicant has demonstrated \nsufficient control of her finances to warrant favorable conclusions of her meeting \nminimum requirements for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

He holds the position of \nSenior Cyber Security Engineer. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in 2011. He is applying for a \nsecurity clearance for the first time. As part of the application process, he completed \nthe security clearance application (SF-86) dated June 2, 2019. In the application, he \ndenied any illegal drug use. During a subsequent subject interview, Applicant admitted \nthat he has used marijuana on a regular basis since 2005, and that he answered the \nquestion on the application incorrectly. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant has used marijuana from about 2005 to at least July 2019 with varying \nfrequency. Applicant stated that he smokes on average between five to ten hits from \nthe vape pen per weekly use. He further stated that he has never purchased, sold or \nmanufactured marijuana. \nHe plans to continue using marijuana for recreational \npurposes, unless he has to quit in order to obtain a security clearance. Applicant stated \nthat his friends know that he smokes marijuana, but his parents do not. He has never \nreceived nor has ever felt the need to receive drug treatment or counseling of any sort. \n(Government Exhibit 4.) \nApplicant also stated that he has never abused any other kind of illegal drugs \nand has never abused prescription drugs or alcohol. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant has deliberately used \nmarijuana for the past fifteen years, from 2005 to at least 2019. It is unclear from the \nrecord whether he has discontinued his use of marijuana. On August 9, 2019, Applicant \nstated his intention was to continue to use marijuana unless he had to quit to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. Even if Applicant has abstained from the use of marijuana since \nAugust 2019, his history of illegal drug use is criminal behavior and shows poor \njudgment. Marijuana is illegal under Federal law, and is clearly prohibited by the DoD \nunder any circumstances. Applicant\u2019s actions are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant is a 40-year-old man. He has \nnot demonstrated the level of maturity needed in order to access classified information. \nApplicant should know the requirements associated with holding a security clearance \nand should know that marijuana use is against Federal law and not tolerated. Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant is not an individual in whom the Government can be confident \nto know that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even \nwhen no one is looking. Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a security \nclearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the Guideline H allegation. I adopt his admission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old. He is single, never married, and has no children. He began working as a systems engineer for a defense contractor in 2017 and that contractor was acquired by his current employer, a defense contractor, subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. He holds a bachelor degree. He is seeking a security clearance for the first time. He received an interim security clearance in approximately June 2018. (Tr. at 6, 27-28, 35; GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant purchased and used marijuana, with varying frequency, between May 2014 and October 2020, while holding a security clearance. The allegation is established by his security application admissions, his admissions to a defense investigator during his background investigation, and his admission in his SOR answer. (GE 1, 2; SOR answer) Applicant described his marijuana use as beginning in approximately 2012, while he was attending college. He acknowledged that his use at the time was illegal under state law. He asserts that the remainder of his marijuana use took place in a state where marijuana use is legal under state law. The frequency of his marijuana use was about four to six times a year.

The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 26, 2021, and the hearing \nwas held as scheduled on November 16, 2021. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nand 2, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit \nlist was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) \nA and B, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on November 29, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the Guideline H allegation. I adopt \nhis admission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old. He is single, never married, and has no children. He \nbegan working as a systems engineer for a defense contractor in 2017 and that \ncontractor was acquired by his current employer, a defense contractor, subject to the \ndrug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. He holds a bachelor degree. He \nis seeking a security clearance for the first time. He received an interim security \nclearance in approximately June 2018. (Tr. at 6, 27-28, 35; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant purchased and used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, between May 2014 and October 2020, while holding a security clearance. \nThe allegation is established by his security application admissions, his admissions to a \ndefense investigator during his background investigation, and his admission in his SOR \nanswer. (GE 1, 2; SOR answer) \nApplicant described his marijuana use as beginning in approximately 2012, while \nhe was attending college. He acknowledged that his use at the time was illegal under \nstate law. He asserts that the remainder of his marijuana use took place in a state \nwhere marijuana use is legal under state law. The frequency of his marijuana use was \nabout four to six times a year. Applicant possessed a security clearance at the time of \nthese uses. He has continued his use of marijuana as recently as in March 2021, after \nthe issuance of his SOR. He characterizes his use of marijuana as spiritual rather than \nrecreational. (Tr. 21, 23; GE 2) \nApplicant admitted his marijuana use when he completed his security clearance \napplication (SCA) in September 2019. He also admitted in his SCA that he intended to \ncontinue using marijuana in the future. When questioned by a defense investigator \nduring his background investigation in October 2019, he again admitted his intention to \nuse marijuana in the future. In January 2021, he answered interrogatories concerning \nhis answers to the defense investigator and he failed to address whether his intent to \nuse marijuana in the future remained. During his hearing testimony, Applicant \nacknowledged that he was probably briefed by his employer when he was hired \nconcerning the illegality of using marijuana as an employee for a defense contractor, but \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nclaims he did not fully understand the implications of that information. He further claims \nthat it was not until sometime in early 2021 when he attended a training class held by \nhis employer concerning its drug-use policy that he finally realized that marijuana use \nviolated federal law and his employer\u2019s drug-use policy. It was at this time that he \nrevised his intentions and committed to not using marijuana in the future. In Applicant\u2019s \nwritten statement of intent not to use marijuana in the future, he stated that his full \nrecognition of the legal implications of his employer\u2019s drug policy became \u201cvery clear\u201d to \nhim when he reviewed new employee training materials in \u201cearly 2020.\u201d He admitted \nusing marijuana after that date. (Tr. 24-25, 27-30; GE 1-2; AE B) \nApplicant offered his job performance appraisals for years 2018-2020. They \nreflected overall ratings of \u201csignificantly exceeded\u201d for 2018, \u201cexceeded\u201d for 2019; and \n\u201cexceeded\u201d for 2020. As stated above, he also offered a written statement, dated April \n2021, expressing that he was not currently using marijuana and that he had no \nintentions to use it in the future. (AE A-B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant started using marijuana in approximately 2012 and continued to use it \nafter being granted a security clearance in 2018. I find both of the above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug\ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future\ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security\neligibility.  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was not infrequent and was as recent as March 2021, \nafter the issuance of his SOR, and while holding a security clearance. Since his \nstatements of intent to use in the future from his SCA and his answers to a defense \ninvestigator were not alleged in the SOR, I will not use them for disqualification \npurposes, but I will consider them as they may be applicable to weighing Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility, to determine the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and in applying the \nwhole-person factors. Applicant admitted that he was briefed by his employer on its \ndrug-use policy when he was hired, but claims he failed to understand its implications. \nGiven his recent marijuana use, including after his SOR was issued, while holding a \nsecurity clearance, and his vacillation regarding his future intent to use marijuana, his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are called into question. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) and AG 26(b) do not apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s job \nperformance appraisals and his recent April 2021 written statement of his intentions not \nto use marijuana in the future. However, I also considered that he regularly used \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance and that he expressed his intention to \ncontinue using marijuana even after being briefed by his employer when he started his \njob, after completing his SCA in 2019, in response to questions by a defense \ninvestigator during his 2019 background investigation, and even after he was issued his \nSOR. His recent marijuana use, while holding a security clearance, demonstrates that \nhe does not possess the reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment to hold a \nsecurity clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 72, is married with four adult children. He received his high school diploma in 1968 and an associate degree in 1984. He has been employed as an electronic technician by a defense contractor since 2007. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item 3) In April 1989, Applicant was charged with engaging in 34 felony counts of lewd acts upon a child. In August 1989, those charges were amended to 18 counts and then to 16 counts. In August 1989, Applicant, represented by counsel, pled guilty to 1 felony count (count #15, as amended) for which he was convicted. The other 15 counts were dismissed. The following is the count to which he pled guilty: COUNT \u2013 15 LEWD ACT UPON A CHILD On and between August 1, 1988 and August 30, 1988 [Applicant] did willfully, unlawfully, and lewdly commit a lewd and lascivious act upon and with the body and certain parts and members thereof of [Child], a child under the age of fourteen years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, and gratifying the lust, passions, and sexual desires of the said defendant and the said child (to wit: Defendant touches Victim\u2019s breasts), in violation of [state law].

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 11, 2017. \nOn November 20, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guidelines D, J, and E. The CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 24, 2021, and requested a decision \nbased on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The case was assigned to me on \nJune 16, 2022. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItems 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 6 are admitted \ninto evidence. Item 6 contained court records, including one page (at 105) that related to \nanother individual who was not Applicant and was not otherwise relevant to this matter, \nand other pages that were unreadable. I concluded that the page at 105 was apparently \ninadvertently included in those records, and I did not consider that page. I also accorded \nno weight to the pages in Item 6 that were unreadable. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 72, is married with four adult children. He received his high school \ndiploma in 1968 and an associate degree in 1984. He has been employed as an electronic \ntechnician by a defense contractor since 2007. This is his first application for a security \nclearance. (Item 3) \nIn April 1989, Applicant was charged with engaging in 34 felony counts of lewd \nacts upon a child. In August 1989, those charges were amended to 18 counts and then \nto 16 counts. In August 1989, Applicant, represented by counsel, pled guilty to 1 felony \ncount (count #15, as amended) for which he was convicted. The other 15 counts were \ndismissed. The following is the count to which he pled guilty: \nCOUNT \u2013 15 LEWD ACT UPON A CHILD \nOn and between August 1, 1988 and August 30, 1988 [Applicant] did \nwillfully, unlawfully, and lewdly commit a lewd and lascivious act upon and \nwith the body and certain parts and members thereof of [Child], a child \nunder the age of fourteen years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, \nand gratifying the lust, passions, and sexual desires of the said defendant \nand the said child (to wit: Defendant touches Victim\u2019s breasts), in violation \nof [state law]. \nIn support of his guilty plea, Applicant endorsed the following handwritten statement \nacknowledging his crime: \u201cOn or about 8/1/88 through 8/30/88, I touched the breasts of a \nchild under the age of fourteen years with the intent of gratifying my sexual desires.\u201d  (Item \n3 at 48; Item 6 at 6-12, 28-29, 33, 47-53, 108-119) \nIn November 1989, Applicant was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to \npay a $100 fine. The maximum penalty was eight years in prison and a $10,000 fine. For \nreasons not indicated in the record, Applicant was released from prison in about \nNovember 1992, at which time he was registered as a sexual offender with no expiration \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndate. In his Answer, Applicant admitted that he has been a registered sex offender since \nNovember 1992. (Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 5, 24, 28) \nOn his SCA, Applicant reported that he pled guilty, in about August 1989, to a \nfelony child sex offense involving a girl under the age of 14; and that he was incarcerated \nfrom about August 1989 through September 1992. In connection with the background \ninvestigation prompted by his SCA, he was interviewed three times: twice in November \n2018 and once in August 2019. He discussed matters relevant to the SOR allegations \nduring the first interview in November 2018 (Interview 1) and the August 2019 interview \n(Interview 3), including his version of the facts and circumstances underlying his arrest \nand conviction. (Items 3, 4) \nInitially during Interview 1, Applicant explained that the child sex offense for which \nhe was arrested involved him showering with the daughter of his wife\u2019s friend, who was \nthen only 13 years old (minor child). He claimed that he did not do anything else with the \nminor child. When asked to provide further information about the incident, he refused to \ndo so on the basis that all he did was shower and could not remember all of the details \nsince it occurred so long ago. (Item 4 at 9) \nSubsequently during Interview 1, Applicant provided some additional details. He \nmaintained that his wife\u2019s friend saw him showering with the minor child and called the \npolice, which resulted in his arrest. He explained that his wife\u2019s friend and the minor child \nwere living with him at the time. He believed that he was rightfully arrested and should \nnot have been showering with someone that young. He asserted that he was not thinking \nat the time and afterwards realized it was a mistake. He did not know why he thought it \nwas okay to do it at the time. He stated that, after pleading guilty to the one child sex \noffense, he was sentenced to three years in prison, which he served from August 1989 \nto September 1992. He confirmed that he was registered as a sex offender, as required. \nHe asserted that it was a one-time offense and that he had not had any other negative \ninteractions with law enforcement or engaged in any other criminal activity. (Item 4 at 9-\n10) \nDuring Interview 3, Applicant claimed that his wife (who had then been living in \nanother country with their children) asked him to allow her friend to live with him so that \nher friend could escape an abusive husband. He stated that he took his wife\u2019s friend and \nher two children (including the minor child and her son) in like family. (Item 4 at 11-12) \nCourt records reflect that the results of the prosecution\u2019s investigation largely \ncontradicted the Applicant\u2019s version of events. The prosecution\u2019s investigation found that \nApplicant engaged in substantially more unlawful sexual activity with the minor child than \nthe one for which he was convicted, and that those acts occurred over an extended period \nof time. Among the court records was a pleading containing a statement of facts, \nendorsed by Applicant\u2019s counsel, that acknowledged that Applicant was the boyfriend of \nthe minor child\u2019s mother, and that the minor child and her mother referred to him as \n\u201cfather.\u201d (Item 6 at 6-12, 14-24, 47-53, 75-76, 86-87, 109-119) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnother court record revealed that Applicant\u2019s wife and four children (including two \ndaughters, then ages 12 and 14) arrived in the United States in about July 1989. At that \ntime, Applicant\u2019s bail conditions were temporarily modified to prohibit him from residing in \nthe same home as his wife and children, and to require that any visitation with his children \nbe supervised by a court-approved agency. During Interview 1, Applicant confirmed that \nhe did not get to see his children for a long period of time. The record did not otherwise \nindicate the specific duration for which his residence and visitation with his children were \nrestricted. The record also did not indicate whether any restrictions or obligations followed \nhis release from prison, including any period of probation (besides requiring him to \nregister as a sex offender). (Item 6 at 66, 69, 76) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer, he admitted the facts alleged under Guidelines H and J \ninvolving his arrest and conviction. In response to the Guideline E allegation (SOR \u00b6 3.a) \ninvolving falsification of facts during Interview 1, he wrote \u201cI admit.\u201d However, I construed \nhis response as a denial because, in the explanation accompanying his response, he \ndenied any deliberate intent due, in part, to English being his second language. He also \nclaimed that he did his best to answer all questions during his background investigation \ninterviews, while also stating that he \u201cdid not give them the detail of that [sic].\u201d \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline D:  Sexual Behavior \nThe general concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about a person's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior includes \nconduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual.  \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 13(a) (sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual \nhas been prosecuted); and AG \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior . . . that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment). \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 14 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nThe criminal sexual offense for which Applicant was convicted was egregious. At \nthe time of the offense, the victim was a minor child who resided in Applicant\u2019s home and \nmaintained a familial-type relationship with Applicant. I considered the significant time that \nhas passed without recidivism or new criminal sexual offenses. However, the nature of \nthe criminal sexual offense and the fact that he remains a registered sex offender preclude \nmitigation. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s lack of candor during Interview 1 about the nature of his \nsexual contact with the minor child casts doubt about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b) is not established. \nGuideline J:  Criminal Conduct \nThe general concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30, as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe record establishes the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the \nconcerns under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline D, Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns raised by his arrest and felony conviction involving criminal sexual contact with \na minor child. That Applicant was prohibited from living in his home with his family and \nspending time with his own children, without supervision by a court-approved agency (for \nat least some period of time); was sentenced to six of the eight-year maximum prison \nterm; and was registered as a sex offender without an expiration date, underscore the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseverity of Applicant\u2019s criminal sexual conduct. I considered the significant time that has \npassed without recidivism or new criminal charges. However, the nature of his criminal \nsexual conduct and the fact that he remains a registered sex offender preclude mitigation. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s failure to be forthright about the true extent of his criminal conduct \nand to fully accept responsibility for his unlawful actions exacerbates the concerns about \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not \nestablished. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe general concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nApplicant\u2019s refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers during Interview 1 \nestablishes the general concern of AG \u00b6 15(b) as argued by the Government. I also find \nsubstantial evidence of an intent on the part of Applicant to omit or conceal materially \nrelevant information during Interview 1, which establishes the following specific \ndisqualifying condition under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nIncorporating my comments under Guidelines D and J, I conclude that Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his lack of candor during Interview\n1. I did not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanation for his lack of candor during Interview 1\nabout the nature of his sexual contact with the minor child. The fact that English is\nApplicant\u2019s second language does not explain why he insisted during Interview 1 that he\nonly showered with the minor child, when he pled guilty to having touched her breast. His\nadmissions to criminal and sexual conduct in generalities on his SCA and in his Answer\ndo not mitigate the fact that he provided not only false and misleading statements, but\nalso omitted and concealed the extent of his sexual contact with the minor child, during\nInterview 1.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to give full, frank, and candid answers to the government in \nconnection with a security clearance investigation not only calls into question his ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, but also reveals a willingness \nto place his own self-interest above his security obligations. Moreover, his refusal to \nacknowledge or accept responsibility for the true nature of his criminal sexual contact with \nthe minor child continues to undermine confidence in his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment, which raises doubt about his ability to safeguard classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(c) is not established. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D, J, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines D, J, and E, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated security concerns raised by his sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal \nconduct. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",
