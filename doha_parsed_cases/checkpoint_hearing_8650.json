Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded (undated) to the SOR in September, 2008, and requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on September 23, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on November 13, 2008.  A hearing was held on November 13, 2008, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant, continue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing,\nthe Government's case consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness\nJanuary 28, 2009\n\n2\n(himself) and three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on November 21, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. For good cause\nshown, Applicant was granted 30 days to supplement the record.  The Government was\nafforded two days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant requested an\nadditional 30 days to file his bankruptcy petition, citing his recent retainer of bankruptcy\ncounsel who requires up front fees of $2,000.00 and a few additional documents from\nApplicant before he will undertake preparation of the filing.  Department counsel did not\nobject to the extension request.  And for good cause shown, Applicant was granted an\nadditional 30 days (to January 12, 2008) to document the filing of his Chapter 7\nbankruptcy petition.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  The submission was admitted as exhibit D.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated five debts\nexceeding $320,000.00 and (b) petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in February\n2000 (discharged in May 2000).  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of\nthe of the allegations. He claimed that his home is no longer in foreclosure, and that he\nis currently working with the lender on a remodification loan.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old security officer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nApplicant married his current spouse in September 1993 (see ex. 1, R.T., at 70).\nHe has three children from his marriage (R.T., at 71).  In 1998 he was injured on the job\nand suffered knee and shoulder injuries (R.T., at 69, 83-84).  He was awarded\nworkman\u2019s compensation benefits which sustained him for a year (R.T., at 85-87).\nBecause his workman\u2019s compensation benefits were less than his work income, he\nused his credit cards to cover his monthly expenses (R.T., at 85-87).  With his income\nsignificantly reduced, Applicant struggled to pay his bills, even with some financial\nassistance from his union.  \nUnemployed and unable to cover his credit card debts, Applicant petitioned for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2000.  He scheduled $20,000.00 in debt and virtually\nno assets.  He received his discharge in May 2000, in what was essentially a no-asset\ncase. \n\n3\nApplicant returned in work in 2000, and for awhile was able to keep up with his\naccounts.  He purchased a home in 2001 for about $225,000.00 (R.T., at 94-95).  He\nmade a down payment of $7,000.00 and obtained a fixed mortgage on the home for\n$225,000.00 (R.T., at 95).  Under the terms of his mortgage, he was obligated to make\n$1,800.00 a monthly payments.  In 2002, he refinanced his home in the strength of a\nvariable rate mortgage that was lower than his original fixed rate and netted him\n$20,000.00 in personal proceeds from his refinance (R.T., at 96).  \nDuring a layoff from his principal employer, Applicant worked in manufacturing\njobs.  He worked in these jobs off and on between January 2002 and October 2004 (see\nex. 1).  He continued paying on this refinanced mortgage for six months.  In December\n2003, his employer shuttered its facility and laid off all of its employees, Applicant\nincluded (see ex. 1; R.T., at 84).  \nBeginning in October 2004, Applicant prepared for a career as a real estate\nagent (ex. 1).  While studying for his real estate license, he went to work for an\nassembly system.  This employer encouraged him to purchase his own truck for work\nuse (see ex. C; R.T., at 62).  Under his arrangements with his employer, his employer\nwould pick-up his fuel and other work-related expenses.  Based on these suggestions,\nApplicant went out and purchased a personal truck for around $20,000.00 (ex. C; R.T.,\nat 62-63) with the intention of using it to pick up and deliver machines for his employer\n(R.T., at 64).  He made payments on this truck before defaulting in June 2007 after his\ncompany (confronting a faltering economy) cut his hours (see exs. 2 through 5 and C).\nHe owes approximately $20,275.00 on this truck on a loan account that was charged\noff, according to his credit reports.  When business did not materialize as Applicant\nanticipated, he tried to return the truck to the dealer (R.T., at 64-65).  However, the\ndealer refused to accept the truck.  As a result, Applicant still retains this truck, which is\nnot operable (R.T., at 65).  \nApplicant struggled  with his real estate business for about two years ((October\n2004 to October 2006).  And for a brief period, he was making enough money to take\ncare of his family and safely discharge his truck and mortgage obligations.   With\nimproved income from his real estate practice and supplemental trucking business, he\nwas able to refinance his home a second time, this time with an even lower variable\nrate.  As a part of his 2005 refinance, he was received back $30,000.00 in proceeds\nfrom the loan payout (R.T., at 97-98).  He continued paying on this refinanced mortgage\nfor six months, until both his real estate and supplemental delivery work .\nWhen the assembly system he affiliated with ceased doing business, Applicant\naffiliated with a trucking concern to earn enough income to support his family (see ex.\nC).  To undertake this work, he needed to have a certain type of commercial truck to\nmeet his delivery orders.  So, in November 2005, Applicant leased a truck that would\nenable him to do additional odd jobs to supplement his real estate income (R.T., at 51-\n52, 58).  The lease value of this truck was $24,000.00 (R.T., at 107).  Under the terms\nof his  lease, he could return the truck in one year for no penalty (see ex. C; R.T., at 59).\nHis monthly payments were $1,050.00 (R.T., at 59). \n\n4\nApplicant made his required monthly payments on his truck lease for over a year;\neven though he was barely able to break even on the jobs he contracted for (ex. C;\nR.T.,at 59-60).  So, after a year, Applicant approached his lessor about returning the\ntruck (R.T., at 60).  The dealer agreed to take the truck and try to sell it for him, but\ncautioned that Applicant would be responsible for the full price of the truck (a switch in\nterms according to Applicant).  Applicant accepted the lessor\u2019s return terms and\nreturned the truck to the lessor.  While the lessor held the truck, Applicant continued to\nmake his $1,000.00 monthly payments (R.T., at 61).  Six months later, the lessor\nadvised that it could not sell the truck. Resigned to losing his truck through\nrepossession, Applicant stopped making payments (R.T., at 61).  He was later advised\nthat the truck was sold at public auction, leaving an $18,117.00 deficiency balance for\nApplicant to tender to satisfy his lease obligations (R.T., at 61-62).  Applicant has never\nbeen able to work out any payment arrangements with the lessor, and the debt has\nsince been charged off (see exs. 2 through 5).\nFor the past two years, the real estate market in his locality has steadily\ndeteriorated.  Unable to make much headway as a real estate agent, he essentially\nwithdrew from the business in October 2006 and took a job as an in-house steel\nrepresentative (see exs. 1 and C).  Not long after he took this job, he suffered a non-\nwork-related ankle injury, and was eventually laid off due to the uncertainty of his\ndoctor\u2019s release (see exs. 1 and C).\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to sell his house to cover his mortgage debt have not been\nsuccessful (R.T., at 67), and he stopped making payments on his home (see 2 through\n5).  He has had little feedback from his lender on his short sale and refinancing requests\n(R.T., at 67, 100-01). In his last communication with the mortgagee, the lender informed\nhim it was thinking about filing for foreclosure.  Whether the lender will follow through\nwith foreclosure is unclear.  Applicant assures that the home next door to him recently\nsold for just $105,000.00, which is less than half of what he owes on his mortgage (R.T.,\nat 102).  \nBesides the charged off debts from his defaults on the two vehicles he acquired,\nApplicant accumulated two other debts.  One was a credit card account he opened in\nJune 2003 with creditor 1.a.  His credit reports show a balance due of $4,004.00 on this\naccount was, which was charged off in December 2006 (see exs. 3 through 5; R.T., at\n53).  The second listed past due debt was a joint retail account opened with creditor 1.b\nin July 1997.  His credit reports reflect a balance due of $187.00 on this account, which\nwas charged off in August 2007 (see exs. 2 through 5).  Applicant tried to work out\npayment arrangements with both creditors, but was refused (R.T., at 56-57).\nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant expressed his intentions to pursue Chapter 7\nbankruptcy (R.T., at 103-04), and documented his retainer agreement with a local\nbankruptcy attorney (see ex. B).  After the, Applicant pursued Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nthrough the attorney he retained to initiate a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in his behalf.\nHe documents the filing of a Chapter 7 petition in January 2009 (see ex. D).  In this\npetition, Applicant scheduled secured debts as follows: his mortgage of $454,824.00 on\n\n The unsecured portion of this creditor\u2019s claim is $280,324, which represents the difference between the creditor\u2019s\n1\nsecured claim on Applicant\u2019s home and the estimated fair market value of the home ($174,500.00).  Essentially, the\nunsecured portion constitutes the expected deficiency were the creditor to foreclose non judicially and perforce\nwaive any deficiency against the debtor.  What remains unclear is how the estimated overall secured claim reached\nthe aggregate of $454,824.00.  Applicant\u2019s estimated secured debts on the home totaled only $275,000.00. \nPresumably, the $454,824.00 figure represents the present value of the loan at its maturity.\n5\nhis home valued at just $174,500, property taxes of $2,007.78, and the deficiency of\n$18,117.00 on his leased truck (ex. D).   He scheduled unsecured non-priority claims of\n1\n$52,954.11 (ex. D).  He has no retained assets other than his home and vehicle\n(covered by creditor 1.d).  He lists income for the past four years as follows: $46,000.00\nfrom his 2008 employment, $44,761.00 from his 2007 employment, $12,028.00 from his\npersonal business in 2006, and just $5,314.00 from his 2006 employment (see ex. D).  \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 package includes his certification that he received financial\ncounseling within 180 days of filing his bankruptcy petition, in accordance with the\nBankruptcy Code\u2019s legal requirements (see ex. D).  A certificate of counseling by a\ncertified financial counselor (dated December 1, 2008) is included in Applicant\u2019s\nbankruptcy petition (ex. D).  The certificate of counseling recited that the counseling\nsession was conducted by internet and telephone and did not include a prepared debt\nrepayment plan.\nApplicant is highly regarded by friends and coworkers (see ex. A; R.T., at 78-79).\nThese friends and coworkers are universal in their praise of Applicant as a model\nemployee and friend who is honest, trustworthy, and very responsible.  Each of his\ndocumented references describe him as inspiring and motivating with excellent\ncharacter qualities (see ex. A).  He assures he lives within his means and drives an old\nPinto vehicle.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n\n6\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a meritorious security guard for a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts over an eight-year period spanning 1999  and\n2007 due to work-related injuries and lay-offs.  Some of these debts were resolved by a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2000.  The remaining debts are being resolved by a\n\n7\nsecond Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  Considered together, and without resolution, his\nrecurrent debt problems raise  security significant concerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay  these debts (except through bankruptcy)\nwarrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines\u00b6 DC\n19(a), inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b619\u00a9) \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to recurrent income shortages following\njob-related injuries and ensuing employment disabilities and job layoffs. He resolved his\nearlier round of delinquent debts with a successful bankruptcy discharge in 2000.  With a\nfamily to support since 2003, recurrent layoffs through no fault of his own, and a\ncollapsing real estate market in his locality, he has had to struggle financially to cover his\nliving expenses.  As a result, he accumulated additional delinquent debts since 2000.\nTwo of Applicant\u2019s largest listed debts involve deficiencies on vehicle acquisitions\n(both purchased and leased) that he had acquired to enable him to perform delivery\nservices that did not materialize as anticipated in the face of a slumping economy in his\nlocality.  His largest debt involves his home that he has not been able to sell or refinance\non more favorable terms with his lender.\nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has initiated considerable efforts to resolve his\nlisted debts, but without any tangible success to date.  Afforded an opportunity to petition\nfor Chapter 7 relief following the hearing, Applicant documents filing a new Chapter 7\npetition: this one in January 2009.  By all accounts this promises to be a no-asset case,\nwhich should encounter no opposition. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s exhibited extenuating circumstances associated with his\nrecurrent job-related injuries and layoffs, the limited resources that have been available\nto him and his family to address his accumulated debt delinquencies, and his\ndocumented  responsible efforts to resolve his debts (first through repayment inquiries\nand then through Chapter 7 bankruptcy), Applicant may rely on \u00b6 MC 20 (b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a\ndeath, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances,\u201d of the Guidelines for financial considerations.  Extenuating\ncircumstances continue to impact Applicant in his current efforts to resolve his\naccumulated debts.  \n\n8\nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on his credible proofs of good\nfaith repayment efforts and bankruptcy initiation when repayment initiatives failed to\nproduce any tangible payment results, age of the debts, and good-faith disputes.  Age of\nthe debts included in Applicant\u2019s first bankruptcy is covered by two of the mitigating\nconditions for financial considerations: \u00b6 MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has\napplicability, while not dispositive.  \u00b6 MC (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d has some applicability as well.\n                                                       \nWhile the counseling advice Applicant relied on from his bankruptcy attorney does\nnot technically fit the definition of counseling services under the Guidelines, he is to be\ncredited with earnestly looking for sources of financial advice with the resources\navailable to him.  He may take advantage, too, of\u00b6 MC 20\u00a9), \u201cthe person has received or\nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Based on the certified counseling he is\ncredited with receiving and his initiated efforts to date, prospects for his gaining important\ninsights in handling his finances in the future appear to be promising.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, his documented steps taken to resolve them, and the responsibility\nand trustworthiness he is credited with in his work and personal life as a struggling head\nof a family, Applicant mitigates security concerns related to his proven debt\ndelinquencies.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.g of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 45-year-old executive assistant employed by a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since May 2007. She previously worked as an executive assistant for a private corporation from October 1990 to April 2001, was unemployed from April 2001 to July 2003, worked as an executive assistant for a defense contractor from July 2003 to March 2007, and was unemployed for about two months before starting her current job. She has never held a security clearance. Applicant was married in November 1985. She has a 27-year-old stepchild and two sons, ages 19 and 20 (Tr. 56). She and her spouse are still married but have been living apart since he left the household and moved to another state in August 2007 (Tr. 105). Because Applicant\u2019s younger son has significant learning disabilities (AX Z), she has enrolled him private schools. Even though her son receives substantial financial aid, Applicant spent more than $21,000 for his tuition, board, and room during the academic year 2006-07 (AX X at 2) and more than $14,000 for 2007-08 ( AX Y at 2). For 3 academic year 2008-09, his educational expense will be about $6,326 (AX AA at 5). Applicant anticipates that this educational expense will be reduced in September 2009, because her son has been awarded a full-tuition scholarship for college (AX L at 2). Applicant\u2019s",

MacKinnon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 7, 2008. On \nAugust 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 15, 2008; answered it on \nSeptember 2, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nDecember 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nreceived the request on September 5, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed \non September 23, 2008, and the case was assigned to me the following day. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on September 26, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October \n23, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through K, which were admitted without objection. \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until November 7, 2008, to enable \nher to submit additional documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nOctober 31, 2008.  \n \nApplicant timely submitted AX L through DD by email, but some of her \ndocuments did not transmit completely. Email correspondence documenting her \ntransmission difficulties is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. I granted her \nadditional time to retransmit her documents, which were received on November 13, \n2008. AX L through DD were admitted without objection. I received Department Counsel \ncomments concerning AX L through DD on December 4, 2008; and they are attached to \nthe record as HX II. On December 12, 2008, I discovered that AX Z was incomplete, \nand I notified the Applicant. I received a complete copy of AX Z on December 15, 2008, \nand the record closed on that date. \n \nCorrection of SOR \n \n \nOn my own motion, and without objection from either party, I amended the SOR \nto correct the spelling of Applicant\u2019s middle name (Tr. 5).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. Her \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old executive assistant employed by a defense contractor.  \nShe has worked for her current employer since May 2007. She previously worked as an \nexecutive assistant for a private corporation from October 1990 to April 2001, was \nunemployed from April 2001 to July 2003, worked as an executive assistant for a \ndefense contractor from July 2003 to March 2007, and was unemployed for about two \nmonths before starting her current job. She has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was married in November 1985. She has a 27-year-old stepchild and \ntwo sons, ages 19 and 20 (Tr. 56). She and her spouse are still married but have been \nliving apart since he left the household and moved to another state in August 2007 (Tr. \n105).  \n \nBecause Applicant\u2019s younger son has significant learning disabilities (AX Z), she \nhas enrolled him private schools. Even though her son receives substantial financial aid, \nApplicant spent more than $21,000 for his tuition, board, and room during the academic \nyear 2006-07 (AX X at 2) and more than $14,000 for 2007-08 ( AX Y at 2). For \n\n \n3 \n \n \nacademic year 2008-09, his educational expense will be about $6,326 (AX AA at 5). \nApplicant anticipates that this educational expense will be reduced in September 2009, \nbecause her son has been awarded a full-tuition scholarship for college (AX L at 2).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s older son attended a private military school at a cost of about $23,000 \nper year (AX W). He is now a college student, and his tuition, board, room, and school \nexpenses are about $22,000 per year (AX BB). Her older son has applied for a \nscholarship (AX L at 1), but there is no evidence he has received it. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law passed away in May 1989. She and her spouse paid his \nburial expenses (AX V). Shortly thereafter, her brother was killed, and they also \nassumed responsibility for his funeral expenses (Tr. 44). At the same time, Applicant\u2019s \nmother-in-law was dying of cancer, and they supported her financially until her demise. \nWhen her mother-in-law died, they discovered she had no insurance, and they paid her \nfuneral expenses (Tr. 45). \n \nApplicant and her spouse sold their home in August 1993 (AX R at 2-6), but they \ndid not report a capital gain on their federal income tax because they invested their \nprofit in a new home (AX R at 18). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed a \ncapital gains tax on the profit from the sale of their home. They protested the \nassessment of a capital gains tax because the gain was reinvested in another personal \nresidence of greater value (AX J). In January 1996, an explanation of the additional tax \nassessment was mailed by the IRS, but it was mailed to an outdated address, as was a \ndeficiency notice in October 1996 (AX H at 1-5). \n \nUsing the proceeds from the 1993 home sale, Applicant and her spouse \npurchased property and obtained a construction loan to build their \u201cdream home\u201d in \nMarch 1994 (AX R at 7-12). Her spouse, in addition to working full-time for the local fire \ndepartment, served as general contractor and builder for the house (AX R at 18). They \nwere forced to borrow additional funds when they encountered unforeseen problems \nsuch as a natural water spring under the property (AX R at 13-14).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was involuntarily retired for disability in August 1994, at about \nhalf his previous pay of $65,000 per year (AX S at 2). He was unable to complete \nconstruction of the house because of his disability and the technical problems they \nencountered (AX R at 18). They were never able to live in the unfinished house, and \nthey sold it in October 1996 (AX R at 16-17). \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted she knew they had an outstanding tax debt \nwhen they purchased the \u201cdream home\u201d property (Tr. 76). When asked if she chose to \nroll the profit from the 1993 sale into the new house instead of paying the tax debt, she \nstated she \u201creally didn\u2019t think about that at the time.\u201d \n \nApplicant and her spouse were assessed with delinquent state taxes for several \ntax years starting in 1992 (AX H at 6). The delinquent state taxes accrued because \nApplicant was living in one state and working in another, and his employer (the fire \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndepartment) did not withhold income tax for their state of residence (Tr. 75). Because of \nthe expenses they had occurred caring for family members and attempting to complete \nconstruction of their home, they were unable to pay the taxes. In April 1996, a state tax \nlien for $548 was filed against Applicant and her spouse (GX 3 at 3; AX F).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse found employment in November 1998, earning about $41,500 \nper year (AX R at 19), In February 1999, Applicant and her spouse purchased a new \nhome (AX R at 20-23). They filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2000, \nand they received a discharge in June 2000. Applicant\u2019s e-QIP reflects that debts \ntotaling about $25,411 were discharged.  \n \nApplicant negotiated a payment plan for their delinquent federal taxes, and she \nmade payments from 1994 to 2000. She stopped making regular payments after they \npurchased their new home in 1999, because she could no longer afford the payments \n(Tr. 89).  \n \nAnother state tax lien for $27,575 was filed against Applicant and her spouse in \nJanuary 2004 (GX 3 at 5; AX E). In March 2005, a tax levy was imposed on her wages \nto collect delinquent federal taxes for tax year 1997 (GX 1 at 27; AX U). A third state tax \nlien for $9,206 was filed against Applicant in January 2006 (GX 4 at 1; AX G). \n \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in May 2006. She paid his funeral and burial \nexpenses, totaling about $7,740 (AX DD).  \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant and her spouse sold the home they had purchased in \nFebruary 1999 (AX R at 26-28), at a profit of about $130,000 (Tr. 59). They used the \nprofits to pay off car loans, a portion of the tax liens, credit card debts, and tuition for \ntheir sons (Tr. 62-64). Applicant now lives with her mother, cares for her, and pays her \nmonthly rent of $850 (Tr. 49, 52). \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax debt for 1994 was paid as of October 2002 (AX C), her \nfederal tax debt for 1996 was paid as of May 2006 (AX D), and her federal tax debt for \n1993 was paid as of October 2007 (AX B). The federal tax lien for tax year 1997 has \nbeen released (AX P at 2). \n \nThe state tax lien filed in April 1996 was released in February 2000 (AX A, B, and \nQ). The balance on the state tax lien filed in January 2004 has been reduced to about \n$11,448 (AX N). The state tax lien filed in January 2006 has increased to $10,572 \nbecause of accrued interest (AX O).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is about $4,000. Her husband has been \nunemployed since late 2004, but he receives disability retirement pay of about $3,500 \nper month (Tr. 51). She testified her husband does not help her with expenses, and that \nshe is \u201c95 percent\u201d responsible for resolving the tax liens and supporting herself, her \nmother, and their two sons (Tr. 55). She has four credit cards and two charge accounts \nwith a total balance of about $5,500, on which all payments are current (Tr. 57). She \n\n \n5 \n \n \nowns an eight-year-old SUV, but she recently purchased a small, 14-year-old car for \n$500 to reduce her fuel costs. \n \n \nApplicant applied for a second job with the U.S. Postal Service in September \n2008. She had completed her interviews and was awaiting medical clearance as of the \ndate of the hearing (AX K; Tr. 48). \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ AG \u00b6 \n19(g) is raised by Afailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.@   \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). AG \u00b6 19(b) is not \nraised because there is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(g) \nis not raised, because the tax liabilities alleged in the SOR did not arise from failure to \nfile returns. Instead, they arose from a dispute about capital gains taxes on the home \nsale in 1993, the failure of her spouse\u2019s employer to withhold state taxes, and their \nfailure to pay the taxes that were due . \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established because the \ndelinquent taxes have not been resolved. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not \nestablished, because Applicant\u2019s financial record reflects numerous delinquent debts. \nHowever, the third prong (\u201cunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d) is \nestablished. The fiasco surrounding Applicant\u2019s efforts to build a \u201cdream home\u201d was \nfraught with unusual circumstances such as the discovery of an underground spring. \nThe delinquent federal tax debt arose from a disputed assessment of capital gains taxes \non the sale of a personal residence, and it is not likely to recur because Applicant no \nlonger owns any real estate. The delinquent state tax debts arose because her spouse \nworked in one state and lived in another, a situation that is not likely to recur.  \n \nThe fourth prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) is not established. In some respects, \nApplicant has reacted to her financial problems responsibly. She has incurred \nconsiderable debt caring for her in-laws and her immediate family, motivated by a \nstrong sense of familial obligation. On the other hand, her decision to purchase real \nestate in 1994 and again in 1999 while facing significant delinquent tax debt suggests \nbad judgment. Her decision to send her learning-disabled younger son to a private \nschool was reasonable, but deferring resolution of her tax debts in order to send her \nolder son to an expensive boarding school is not justified by the evidence in this record. \nWhile a private school may be reasonable or even necessary to provide personal \nattention, smaller classes, discipline, or specific values, Applicant has not provided any \nsuch justification regarding her older son, nor has she established the reasonableness \nof deferring payment of her delinquent taxes in order to defray the cost a boarding \nschool instead of traditional arrangement where the student lives at home. I conclude \nthe fourth prong of AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \nApplicant has encountered numerous conditions beyond her control: the \nunforeseen technical difficulties in building the \u201cdream house,\u201d her spouse\u2019s disability, \nher younger son\u2019s learning disability, the illness and deaths of her father-in-law, brother, \nand father, and abandonment by her spouse. Applicant\u2019s spouse abandoned the \nhousehold in August 2007, long after the debts alleged in the SOR were incurred and \nbecame delinquent. Nevertheless, the other conditions beyond her control are sufficient \nto establish the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nWhen Applicant filed her bankruptcy petition in February 2000, it was a \nreasonable and prudent response to the debts incurred as a result of illnesses and \ndeaths in the family and the financial drain of the \u201cdream home\u201d fiasco. On the other \nhand, using available assets in March 1994 and again in February 1999 to purchase a \nhome instead of resolving the delinquent taxes was not responsible conduct. Incurring \nlarge educational debts to accommodate her younger son\u2019s learning disabilities was \nresponsible conduct, but there is no similar justification established on the record for the \nexpense of a private boarding school for her older son. I conclude the second prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \n\u201c[A]n applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that [he/she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR . . . All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that [he/she] has . . . established a plan to resolve [his/her] financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d ADP Case No. 06-18900 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008).  \n \n \nApplicant and her spouse sold the family home in March 2007 and used the \nproceeds to pay off debts. She lives frugally and has applied for a second job so that \nshe can resolve her remaining tax debt. On the other hand, she chose to use her limited \nfinancial assets to purchase the property and construct the \u201cdream home\u201d in 1994, \npurchase another home in 1999, and enroll her older son in an expensive boarding \nschool instead of settling her tax debts. The federal tax lien for 1997 was not resolved \nby voluntary payment, but by a tax levy on her pay. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established \nfor the debts discharged by bankruptcy alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the state tax lien \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. It is not established, however, for the state tax liens alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c and the federal tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under in my discussion of Guideline F, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is an intelligent, articulate, mature woman who presented herself at the \nhearing as candid and sincere. She is deeply devoted to her family, and she has been \nbeset with numerous financial setbacks. She has not spent money selfishly or \nfrivolously. However, she has not been diligent in resolving her tax debts. While some of \nher financial decisions, standing alone, might not raise security concerns, her financial \nrecord as a whole raises concerns about her judgment and reliability. The likelihood of \nrecurrence cannot be discounted in light of her pattern of inattention to her delinquent \ntaxes. Her continuing tax debt makes her vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, \nor duress.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

His wife \nand son are United States born citizens living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). \nApplicant has rebutted or mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Clearance is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s (DoD) intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, 2006. \n1 \n \nDecember 20, 2010\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on January 26, 2010, detailing security concerns under \nforeign influence. \n \n  \nOn March 1, 2010, Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was received in which \nApplicant requested a hearing. On July 13, 2010, I was assigned the case. On July 30, \n2010, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing for the hearing held on August 17, 2010.  \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A \nthrough J, which were admitted into evidence without objection. On August 25, 2010, \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the factual allegations, with \nexplanations, of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are \nincorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old telecommunications engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since May 2003, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s co-workers and supervisors state: Applicant is a consummate professional. \nHis personal conduct has been exemplarily. He is dedicated and has outstanding \ntechnical ability. He can always be relied upon to do whatever needs to be done to \ncomplete the mission. (Ex. A, B, C, D, and J) He received four certificates of service \nrecognizing his outstanding dedication and courage. (Ex. E, F, G, and H) In June 2009, \nhe received an individual achievement award in recognition of his ongoing commitment \nto outstanding job performance. (Ex. I)  \n \nIn 1982, Applicant\u2014then 19 years old\u2014came to the United States to attend \ncollege. He grew up in Morocco near a U.S military base. (Tr. 76) His uncle came to the \nUnited States when Applicant was five years old. His uncle is a naturalized United \nStates citizen and always encouraged him to come to the United States. (Tr. 76)  \n \nIn 1984, Applicant married another student who was a native born United States \ncitizen. (Ex. 1) His wife chose not to accompany him when he went to grad school in \nanother state. (Tr. 80) They divorced in 1987. He has had not contact with her since \n1990. (Ex. 1) In 1985, he joined the United States Army reserves, obtaining the rank of \nE-4. (Tr. 32) He last served in the reserves just before the First Gulf War. (Tr. 45) In \n1986, he obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree. In December 1988, he obtained a Master\u2019s \ndegree in Mathematics. In March 1991, he became a naturalized United States citizen. \n(Ex. 1) He was enrolled in a PhD program when he took a job with a DoD contractor. \n(Ex. 32) The telecommunications project was in Egypt. In Egypt, he met and married a \nwoman. (Tr. 37) In August 1993, their son was born in the United States. (Tr. 37, Tr. 71, \nEx. 1) In 1993, he returned from the project and was assigned a new project in Saudi \nArabia. (Tr. 33) When he returned to the United States, he obtained a new contractor\u2019s \n2 \n \n\njob. That company was purchased by his present employer. (Tr. 33) He spent eight \nyears on the project in Saudi Arabia holding a secret clearance. (Tr. 33)  \n \nIn 1994, Applicant purchased a house in the United States for $240,000. (Tr. 74) \nIt is currently worth approximately $600,000 and is rented. (Tr. 74)  \n \nSince May 2003, Applicant has resided in Baghdad working for a DoD contractor. \n(Tr. 38, SOR Answer) The job is wearing him out. He believes he has been working with \nthe United States government in Iraq longer than any other individual. (Tr. 38) He has \nthought of returning to the United States numerous times, but each time his employer \nconvinces him to stay six months longer. (Tr. 38) In 2011, his son graduates from high \nschool and is planning on attending college in the United States. Following high-school \ngraduation, Applicant intends to return to his home in California with his wife and son.  \n \nIn December 2007, Applicant remarried. In 2003, his wife, born in Missouri, was \ndeployed to Iraq as a United States Army captain. (Ex. 2) She was there 15 months \nbefore becoming a contactor working as an advisor to the Iraqi ministry of defense. \n(SOR Answer) His son, now in the 11th grade, lives with his current wife in the UAE. (Ex. \n2) In 2007, he purchased a condo ($500,000) for his wife and son. (Ex. 2)They chose to \nlive in the UAE simply because it is convenient for him to visit them there. (Tr. 38, 51) \nThere are flights from Iraq to the UAE making visiting his son and wife easier. He visits \nthem every two weeks. His wife currently does not work. (Tr. 68) Having been in Iraq \nseven years, he looks forward to relocating back to the United States. Applicant has no \nplans of remaining in UAE when his current contractor job ends. (tr. 49) It is his plan, to \nreturn to the United States when his son finishes high school. (Tr. 50)  \nIn 2004 or 2005, Applicant purchased a $200,000 condominium in a gated \ncommunity in Morocco. It is less than 1,000 square feet in size. When his mother\u2019s \nhealth was better, she would spend three months there each year. (Tr. 64) Currently, no \none lives there. He may use it when he is older and retired. (Tr. 64, SOR Answer).  \nHe and his wife purchased an apartment in the UAE for $283,000. He had made \na $90,000 payment on the property before construction on the property stopped. (Tr. \n67) Construction on the property remains halted. He hopes to sell the property for what \nhe paid for it, but thinks he may get nothing from it. (Tr. 50, 68) He also purchased \ninvestment property in the UAE. Due to an economic slump the investment property \n($283,000) is worth much less than he paid for it. (SOR Answer) He hopes he will not \nlose money on the purchase. (SOR Answer)  \n \nHis mother and father divorced when Applicant was six-months old. (Tr. 31, SOR \nAnswer) A year after the divorce, Applicant\u2019s mother remarried. He first learned in the \nfifth grade, his step-father was not his father. (Tr. 31) His step-father is retired from a \nprivate construction business. (Ex. 2) He has no bond with his step-father. (Tr. 59) He \nsometimes talks with his step-father when he calls his mother. He has never specifically \ncalled his step-father. (Tr. 58) His mother had a son and daughter with his step-father. \nHis step-sister is a pharmacist who lives near their mother. She does much to care for \ntheir mother. (Tr. 56) He calls his step-sister about once a month, but the frequency also \n3 \n \n\ndepends on his mother\u2019s health. (Tr. 82) His step-sister\u2019s husband is a wholesaler of \ncosmetic products. They have three children. Applicant\u2019s step-brother lives in the United \nStates. (Tr. 43)  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s mother, step-father, aunt, half sister and two step-brothers are \ncitizens and residents of Morocco. (Ex 3) His mother is a retired high school principal. \nHis mother suffers from a loss of sight and depression. (Tr. 88) Applicant calls his \nmother in the morning and his step-brother, who lives in the United States, calls her \neach night. (Tr. 54) His step-brother has lived in the United States since 1993 and \nbecame a naturalized United States citizen in 1997. (Tr. 59, Ex. 1) Applicant tries to call \nhis mother daily. (Tr. 81) Many of his calls to his mother and step-sister were to inform \nthem about his safety. He lives in Iraq where there are bombings. He calls these \nindividuals to inform them he is healthy. (Tr. 58)  \n \nHe first met his father when he was 11 years old. (Tr. 31, SOR Answer) When \nthey met, there was no rapport between them. (Tr. 31) His father remarried and had two \nboys and a girl. In May 2007, Applicant was in Morocco for five days attending his \nfather\u2019s funeral. (Ex. 2) Until his father\u2019s funeral he was unaware of his step-siblings. \n(Tr. 2) Other than at his father\u2019s funeral, Applicant has not had any contact with his step-\nmother, who is retired from the Morocco Ministry of Finance. He has had limited contact \nwith his step-siblings. (Tr. 2) His father has three sisters, two of whom live in Morocco \nand one lives in Lebanon. He calls his aunt, who is retired, every six months. (Tr. 57) \nHis aunt\u2019s daughter and the daughter\u2019s two children live in the United States. (Tr. 57)  \n \nOne of his father\u2019s sons works in the construction business and the other works \nfor a travel agency. Applicant never grew up with his three step-siblings. Since his \nfather\u2019s funeral, Applicant has received an email from a step-brother and step-sister \neach informing him they had married. (Tr. 60, 85) Applicant\u2019s step-sister is a citizen of \nMorocco who works in a fashion house in France. She sent an email informing that his \nfather had cancer and then informed him of their father\u2019s death. (Tr. 61) The total \namount of emails received from her is five. (Tr. 62) His last email from her was a year \nago when she married. (Tr. 86) He has no communication with his step-mother. (Tr. 62) \n \nIn June 2006, Applicant and his second wife divorced. They had separated in \nAugust 1994, when she moved to Saudi Arabia. (Ex. 2) She currently lives in Egypt. He \nhad been sending her $1,000 per month, but that ended when their son moved in with \nhis current wife. (Tr. 79, Ex. 2) He periodically talks with his ex-wife about their son\u2019s \nwelfare, education, and discipline. (Ex. 3)  \n \nApplicant last visited Morocco, three weeks before the hearing. (Tr. 72) His \nprevious trip had been April 2009. (Tr. 73)  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Morocco and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) contained in \n4 \n \n\nhearing exhibit I, which was done. (Tr. 17) The following information is of record \nconcerning Morocco: \n \nMorocco is a constitutional monarchy with a Parliament and an independent \njudiciary; however, ultimate authority rests with the king. Morocco was the first country \nto seek diplomatic relations with the Government of the United States in 1777, and \nremains one of our oldest and closest allies in the region. United States-Moroccan \nrelations, characterized by mutual respect and friendship, have remained strong through \ncooperation and sustained high-level dialogue. \n \nMorocco is a moderate Arab state which maintains close relations with Europe \nand the United States. It contributes consistently to UN peacekeeping efforts on the \ncontinent. Morocco was the first Arab state to condemn Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in \n1990, and sent troops to help defend Saudi Arabia. Morocco has supported efforts to \nstabilize Iraq following the downfall of Saddam Hussein. Morocco was among the first \nArab and Islamic states to denounce the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the \nUnited States and declare solidarity with the American people in the war against terror. \n \nAs a stable, democratizing, and liberalizing Arab Muslim nation, Morocco is \nimportant for United States interests in the Middle East. Accordingly, United States \npolicy toward Morocco seeks sustained and strong engagement, and identifies priorities \nfor reform, conflict resolution, counterterrorism cooperation, and public outreach. \nReports of torture by various branches of the security forces persisted. Other areas of \nconcern cited by the State Department include arbitrary arrests, incommunicado \ndetentions, and police and security forces impunity. \n \nThe following information is of record concerning the United Arab Emirates (UAE) \nMorocco: \n \nThe UAE is a federation of individually ruled emirates, each with its own ruler. \nThe government is a federal republic with a president and a council of ministers. The \nUnited States has had friendly relations with the UAE since their formation in 1971. The \nrelationship drew closer during the Iraqi incursion into Kuwait in 1991. Islamic ideals and \nbeliefs provide the conservative foundation of the country\u2019s customs, laws and \npractices. Only 15-20% of the UAE\u2019s population are UAE citizens. The remaining \npopulation includes significant numbers of other Arabs, including many Iranians. About \n85 percent of the country's population are expatriates \n \nThe UAE contributes to the continued security of the Persian Gulf, and is a \nreliable partner in the regional and global war on terror, providing military, diplomatic \nand financial assistance. The UAE is a reliable partner in the regional and global war on \nterror. However, the UAE was one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban as \nthe legitimate government of Afghanistan.  \n \nThe low number of human rights problems in the UAE is attributed to the lack of \nelections and certain restrictions on civil liberties. However, while there are no \n5 \n \n\ndemocratically elected political parties, UAE citizens are allowed to air their concerns to \nUAE leaders in council-type meetings. Although the law prevents freedom of assembly, \nmodest demonstrations on working conditions have been permitted. Arbitrary arrests \nare prohibited, but reports have disclosed that the government has held people without \nformally charging them. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \n6 \n \n\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFOREIGN INFLUENCE  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in United States interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and \nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;2 \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \n                                                          \n2 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n7 \n \n\ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nApplicant has frequent contact with his mother, who is a resident citizen of \nMorocco. He has less frequent contacts with his step-sister. He has almost no contact \nwith his deceased father\u2019s spouse, children, or sisters. His wife and son live in the UAE. \nHis connections to his mother, step-sister, wife, and son create a potential conflict of \ninterest because the relationships are sufficiently close in nature and could raise a \nsecurity concern over his desire to help his family.  \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those four disqualifying \nconditions and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation. Four of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation;  \n. . . \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents divorced when he was six-months old. At age 11, he first \nlearned his step-father was not his natural father. His contact with his father and his \nfather\u2019s family has been minimal. Until shortly before May 2007, when he attended his \nfather\u2019s funeral, he was unaware he had step-siblings. Since the funeral, he has had no \ncontact with his step-mother and minimal contact from his step-siblings. He has \nreceived emails from a step-brother and a step-sister informing him of each of their \nmarriages. He has had four emails with his father\u2019s sister. He talks with his step-father \nwhen he visits Morocco. Because of his minimal contact and his relations with these \nrelatives, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(c) applies and mitigates the concern related to: his step-father, his \nstep-mother, his father\u2019s sisters, and his father\u2019s two sons and daughter. His step-\n8 \n \n\nbrother who is a naturalized United States citizen living in the United States is not a \nsecurity concern.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c) have some application to Applicant\u2019s relationships with his \nmother and step-sister. Neither of these relatives are in positions connected with the \nMoroccan government or engaged in activities that would likely cause Applicant to be \nexploited or placed in a position of having to choose between them and the United \nStates. His mother is a retired high school teacher and his step-sister is a pharmacist. \nHe frequently talks with his mother and talks to his step-sister monthly. His contact with \nhis step-sister appears to be infrequent, but it is not clear that the contact is so casual \nthat it does not create any risk of foreign influence. \nThis leaves the question whether his mother, step-sister, wife, and son are in a \nposition to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to choose \nbetween loyalty to the in-laws and the United States. The disqualifying condition \nrequires that a foreign power would exploit its citizens or residents in such a way as to \nmake Applicant act adversely to the interests of the United States. A factor to consider, \nwhile not determinative, is the character of the foreign power and entities within the \nforeign country. This review is not limited to countries that are hostile to the United \nStates. Friendly countries may have profound disagreements with the United States or \nhave engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in economic, scientific, \nmilitary, and technical fields. A friendly relationship is not determinative, but it may make \nit less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a United States citizen \nthrough relatives or associates in that foreign country.  \nMorocco is a modern country, with close commercial and trade ties to the United \nStates. It is an ally with the United States in combating terrorism. There are terrorist \nactivities in the country and its citizens have been involved in international terrorism. \nWhile there have been human rights abuses, there have been many strides made by \nthe government and monarchy to embrace more democratic practices. I find Applicant's \nmother and step-sister in Morocco are no more vulnerable to exploitation by a foreign \npower than any other person in the country.  \nThe United States has had friendly relations with the UAE since their formation in \n1971. The relationship drew closer during the Iraqi incursion into Kuwait in 1991. The \nUAE is a reliable partner in the regional and global war on terror. There is a low number \nof human rights problems in the UAE. Applicant's mother and step-sister in Morocco are \nno more vulnerable to exploitation by a foreign power than any other person in the \ncountry. The possibility that pressure would be imposed upon them by the UAE \ngovernment is less likely because both are native born United States citizens. No \nevidence was presented suggesting the Moroccan government has used its resident \ncitizens to extract information from United States relatives. There is no evidence the \nUAE has attempted to extract information from United States citizens living there. The \nlikelihood of such an occurrence appears remote.  \n \n9 \n \n\nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of United States interests. He has lived in the United States since 1982 \nwhen he arrived to attend college and then graduate school. After earning his advanced \ndegree, he began working in the United States. In 1985, he joined the United States \nArmy reserve. In March 1991, he became a United States citizen. His son was born in \nthe United States and his wife, a prior United States Army captain, is a United States \ncitizen by birth.  \n \n \nApplicant owns a home in California worth approximately $600,000. He owns a \nsmall condo in Morocco, which his mother used periodically before her health failed. He \nintends to keep the property and possible use it for visits at some future date. He \npurchased investment property ($283,000) in the UAE. He hopes to recover what he \ninvested in the property, but that is unlikely since construction on the property has \nstopped. The property is possibly worthless. He also has a condo in the UAE \n($500,000) where his son and wife reside. Next year his son is finishing high school and \nintends to go to college in California. It is Applicant\u2019s hope that he, his wife, and son will \nall return to California in 2011.  \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8(b) apply. The value of the foreign \nproperty is such that when compared to his home in the United States, they are unlikely \nto result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or \npressure the individual \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d analysis. Under the whole-\nperson concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n10 \n \n\n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Morocco and the UAE. The Appeal Board requires the whole-person \nanalysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of \nan applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the United States relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign \ncountry; his or her ties social ties within the United States; and many others raised by \nthe facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards granting Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n \nApplicant is a mature person and has been a naturalized citizen for the past 19 \nyears. Applicant\u2019s spouse and son are both native born Unites States citizens. His step-\nbrother is a naturalized United States citizen who lives in the United States. Applicant \nchose to come to the United States in 1982, when he was 19 years old to attend college \nand later to obtain his master\u2019s degree. He is providing services to the United States \ngovernment. He has served in the United States Army reserve. His ties to the United \nStates are much stronger than his ties to his mother and step-sister in Morocco. There \nis no evidence he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the \nUnited States. Applicant has no meaningful relationship with his step-father, step-\nmother, or any of his father\u2019s relatives, who live in Morocco. He does not communicate \nwith them or maintain a relationship with them. The record contains no derogatory \ninformation about him. \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Morocco and the UAE. Applicant was raised, in part, in Morocco, and \nhas various immediate and non-immediate family members who are citizens and \nresidents of Morocco. His wife and son live in the UAE because it makes visiting them \neasier. Neither has a connection with the UAE and both are planning to leave when \nApplicant\u2019s son returns to the United States to start college in 2011.  \n \nApplicant owns three pieces of real estate overseas. At some future date \nfollowing retirement, he may vacation part of the year in the Moroccan property. The \ninvestment property in the UAE may be worthless. Construction on the project has \nstopped, but Applicant hopes he may recover something from his investment. The \ncondo present owned by his wife and son in the UAE will be vacated when they return \nto his California home which is valued at $600,000. \n \nThis case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that the Moroccan and UAE governments or its agents might \nexploit or attempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in such a way that \nthis United States citizen would have to choose between his pledged loyalty to the \nUnited States and those family members.  \n11 \n \n\n12 \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:  FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.l:   \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for\neligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn August 15, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security\nPositions (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance required for his job with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) twice issued to\nApplicant written interrogatories  regarding information in his background. Based on the\n1\nresults of the background investigation and his responses to the interrogatories, DOHA\nadjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n2\nSeptember 18, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines replace the guidelines listed in Enclosure\n2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7.\n4\n Id. \n5\n2\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified\ninformation. On March 27, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline H (illegal drugs).\n3\nOn April 14, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. On May 7, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. The FORM\n4\nincluded six documents (Items 1 - 6) proffered in support of the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant received the FORM on May 13, 2009. He had 30 days from receipt of the\nFORM in which to file a response and additional information.  However, he did not\n5\ntimely submit further information and the case was assigned to me on August 4, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant used marijuana between 24 and 50 times\nfrom 1993 until at least April 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he grew marijuana and sold it to\nhelp finance his wedding in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he grew and sold marijuana\nwhile he was in college (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant admitted these allegations without\nexplanation. (FORM, Item 3) In addition to the facts entered in the record through\nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old college graduate with a degree in Management and\nInformation Systems. He has worked as a Lead Developer for his current employer\nsince February 2005. Applicant and his wife have been married since June 2003, and\nthey have two children (ages 4 and 2). (FORM, Items 4 and 5)\nWhen Applicant submitted his SF 86, he disclosed that he had used marijuana\n10 times since February 2004 and that he had produced, bought, and sold illegal drugs\nfor profit. (FORM, Item 4) When he was interviewed by a government investigator in\nNovember 2007, he further disclosed that he had actually used marijuana as many as\n50 times from 1993, his second year in college, until October 2007. He stated that he\nhas generally used the drug alone or with his wife. He also disclosed that he grew and\nsold about one pound of marijuana to finance his wedding reception. (FORM, Item 5). \nAt the time he responded to a second set of DOHA interrogatories on July 14,\n2008, Applicant had last used marijuana in April 2008. He also stated that his wife still\nused marijuana at home, and that his use had moderated such that he had used about\n24 times over the previous 24 months. He also averred that he easily could stop using,\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n3\nif necessary for his job or security clearance, because his use of marijuana is so\ninfrequent. He has stopped in the past for work or when his wife has been pregnant.\n(FORM, Item 6)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n6\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concern and adjudicative factors under AG \u00b6 24\n(Guideline H - drug involvement).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n8\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n4\ninterest as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.9\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement\nThe security concern raised by the allegations of illegal drug involvement by the\nApplicant is that \u201c[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 24.\nThe government\u2019s information is sufficient to support, and Applicant has admitted\nto, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c; specifically, that he used, produced, possessed,\nand/or trafficked in illegal drugs from the time he was about 19 years old until he was 35\nyears old. Available information requires application of the disqualifying conditions at AG\n\u00b6 25(a) ([a]ny drug abuse) and AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia). \nThe security significance of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement might be\nmitigated if he could show that his use was not recent, that it was infrequent, is not likely\nto recur, or does not cast doubt on his \u201ccurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d (AG \u00b6 26(a)) The facts established here might also be mitigated if Applicant\ncould establish \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndissociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 26(b)) As to recency and \u201can appropriate period of abstinence,\u201d he has not stated that\nhe no longer uses marijuana. Even if he did stop using in April 2008, because he had\nused marijuana for his entire adult life, abstinence between over the ensuing 18 months\nis insignificant. Further, Applicant\u2019s statement that he would stop using if necessary for\nhis job or security clearance is not sufficient for the government to entrust him with\nsensitive information. Finally, he has not, and likely will not, disassociate himself from\nothers who use illegal drugs, because his wife still smokes marijuana. On balance, there\nis no information available on which to base application of any of the Guideline H\nmitigating conditions.\nWhole Person Concept \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline H. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 35 years old and\n\n See footnote 6, supra.\n10\n See footnote 9, supra. \n11\n5\npresumed to be a mature adult. However, available information shows only that he has\nbeen significantly involved with illegal drugs for his entire adult life and that marijuana is\nstill prevalent in his personal circumstances through his wife\u2019s ongoing use, if not\nthrough his own use. There is no information in this record about any other facet of his\nbackground that sufficiently counters the adverse information underlying the security\nconcerns about his drug use. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n10\ninformation bearing on Applicant\u2019s drug use shows he has failed to address\nsatisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about his suitability for access to classified\ninformation. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

GE 1, Tr. 21-23. Applicant has held a \nsecret security clearance since April 2001. He seeks to retain his clearance, which is \nrequired as a condition of his employment. Tr. 29-32.  \n \nApplicant did not graduate from high school, but was awarded a GED (date \nuncertain). He was awarded an Associate of Applied Science in Architecture and \nConstruction Technology (Architecture) Degree in May 1999. GE 1, AE D, Tr. 27-29. \nApplicant married in September 2002. He has three stepdaughters, ages 28, 25, 23, \nand an eight-year-old daughter born during his marriage. GE 1, Tr. 23-27. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nApplicant has a history of episodic alcohol abuse, marked by five alcohol-related \narrests spanning a 21-year period from May 1985 to September 2006. His arrests are \nsummarized below: \n \n1. May 1985 \u2013 Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence \n(DUI). He recalls being stopped by the police and told that he was following too close \nwith his bright lights on. When stopped, he admitted that he had been drinking. He \npassed the sobriety test, but failed the breathalyzer. He does not recall his blood alcohol \ncontent (BAC). He spent the night in jail and was released on his own recognizance. \nWhen he appeared for his court appearance, he was convicted of Driving While Ability \nImpaired, fined $300, ordered to perform 48 hours of community service, and sentenced \nto 30 days in jail, suspended. Tr. 34-35, GE 2, GE 3. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n2. October 1988 \u2013 Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was drinking at a \nlocal pub and was stopped by the police on the way home for speeding and for failure to \nstop at a stop signal. He was later cited for driving with no insurance. He failed the \nsobriety test. When he appeared for his court appearance, he was ordered to spend six \nmonths in jail, but was released after four months for good behavior. When queried \nabout the length of his jail sentence, Applicant responded: \n \nQ. Were you \u2013 did you receive that heavy of a jail sentence because it \nwas a second offense? \n \nA. I believe that in that instance, I was belligerent with the judge during \nsentencing. \n \nQ. Oh, okay. How were you belligerent with the judge? \n \nA. He asked me what I thought about this, and I frankly told him it\u2019s a \ncrock of (expletive deleted). And, he said, \u201cOkay, you can spend six \nmonths and think about that.\u201d Tr. 35-37, GE 2. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) \n \n3. December 1992 \u2013 Applicant was arrested and charged with larceny for taking beer \nfrom a liquor store. Applicant does not recall many details about this incident. He knew \nthe owner of the liquor store, and claims he told the liquor store clerk he had a 12 pack \nof beer and would pay him the next day. The police were subsequently involved and \nApplicant spent the night in jail. To the best of Applicant\u2019s knowledge, the charge was \ndropped after he paid the owner for the beer. Tr. 37-40. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \n \n4. May 1995 \u2013 Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was drinking at a local \npub and was stopped by the police for speeding when following a band member home \nat a high rate of speed. He failed the sobriety test. When he appeared for his court \nhearing, he was ordered to spend 30 days in an alcohol treatment facility. When queried \nabout the arrest, Applicant responded: \n \nA. And, I remember this well because the police officer asked me to get \nout of the truck. And I told him, \u201cNo, I really don\u2019t think you want me to.\u201d \nAnd he said, \u201cYeah, we need you to step out of the truck.\u201d And, I opened \nthe door and basically poured out on the pavement.  \n \nAnd he gave me roadside sobriety tests, and I failed miserably. I could \nhardly stand up at the time, if I remember correctly. Seemed like he invited \nevery police officer on duty that night to come over and re-do the roadside \nsobriety tests in front of them so they could all get a good laugh. \n \nEnded up going to court over this, and I asked the judge at that time, I \nasked him, \u201cCan I do some, some, in-house therapy instead of going to \njail?\u201d Because now I think I\u2019m having an alcohol problem with this, you \n\n \n4 \n \n \nknow, seeing I had priors, and so the judge agreed to that. And, I did 30 \ndays inpatient treatment.  \n \nApplicant remained sober \u201ceight months, eight, nine months\u201d after completing this \ntreatment program. He resumed drinking because he thought he \u201ccould handle it.\u201d He \n\u201cended up in detox shortly after that, probably 10, 12 months, I don\u2019t remember how \nlong. It could have been a year or two after that. And I remember I walked out of detox \nin the morning, and went to the nearest pub I could find, and it was closed.\u201d He \ncontinued to drink after this incident, \u201cbut not to the same extent.\u201d Tr. 40-44, GE 2. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.) \n \n5. September 2006 \u2013 Applicant was charged with DUI, and convicted of Driving While \nAbility Impaired. He stated he began drinking following a disagreement with his wife \nabout her \u201cnagging\u201d him to speak to his ill mother-in-law, who lived with them in their \nbasement. He went for a drive to \u201cchill out\u201d and decided to get a package of cigarettes. \nAt the location where he purchased the cigarettes, he hit someone when pulling out of \nthe driveway and \u201cthat really pissed [him] off.\u201d He decided to leave the scene of the \naccident and go home. He started drinking rum and decided to go back to the accident \nscene. After visiting the accident scene, he returned home and continued to drink rum. \nThe police showed up at his door, and initially he denied being involved in the accident. \n \nWhen Applicant was sentenced in April 2007, he was ordered to complete Level \nII alcohol education and 86 hours of therapy at a state-certified agency no later than \nAugust 2008. He was further ordered to complete 24 hours of useful public service, \nrefrain from consuming alcoholic beverages for the period of probation/treatment, pay a \n$200 supervision fee and court costs of $410, serve 150 days home detention with a \nreport date in April 2007, and 30 days in jail (suspended). Additionally, following this \nincident, his state licensing agency revoked his driving privileges for two years because \nhe had been convicted of a third alcohol-related offense. His driver\u2019s license was \nreinstated in May 2008. Tr. 44-49, GE 2. \n \nThe following is a colloquy between Department Counsel and the Applicant \nregarding Applicant\u2019s current alcohol consumption: \n \nQ. Now, according to your answer, at the time you filed your \nanswer, you had, you had resumed drinking again, is that correct? \n \nA. Yes. I mean, I stopped drinking once in a while. I can\u2019t say that I \ntotally stopped. You know, my drinking, you know, in my opinion it pretty \nmuch stopped. I mean, I only drink maybe three times a year, you know. I \nmean, since this last incident, I think I\u2019ve drank four times. And, prior to \nthat, it was far and few between. \n \nQ. Well, do you recall telling the OPM investigator back in January, \n2008 that your intention was not to drink at all again? \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA. Yes. \n \nQ. And, so you\u2019ve changed your mind since then? \n \nA. No, my intention is still the same. \n \nQ. Your intention is not to drink at all? \n \nA. Yes. \n \nQ. But you do drink? \n \nA. Occasionally. I mean, I don\u2019t \u2013 when I made that statement, \u201cI \ndon\u2019t intend to drink again,\u201d I don\u2019t intend to ever let myself get out of \ncontrol, you know, not to totally get blasted there, you know. I mean, I do \nbelieve a person can responsibly drink one or two and be considered \nactually not drinking. \n \nQ. Do you consider yourself an alcoholic? \n \nA. No, I don\u2019t. In the past, yes. Not today. Tr. 49-50. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant stated the last time he had a drink was \u201c[t]wo, three \nmonths ago.\u201d Tr. 51. He also stated that he went to two AA meetings in the week before \nhis hearing. Tr. 52. He added, \u201c. . . I find it offensive, you know, that, that I\u2019m here trying \nto defend myself.\u201d Tr. 53.  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nSix character witnesses made statements on Applicant\u2019s behalf to include family \nmembers and extended family members. Those who testified stated that during the \nlimited times they observed Applicant, he drank responsibly or not at all. His wife did not \ntestify at his hearing. She did submit a character letter, discussed infra. \n \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application worksheet \nlisting his September 2006 DUI charge, and stated that he revealed past DUI arrests on \nprevious security clearance applications to show that he has a history of being \nforthright. Tr. 77-78, AE A, AE B. He submitted a copy of the DSM IV to show he does \n\u201cnot fall under the dependent or abusive categories.\u201d Tr. 78-79, AE C. Applicant \nsubmitted a copy of his Associate of Applied Science Degree from a community college, \ndiscussed supra, as well as a Phi Theta Kappa Society certificate for scholastic \nachievement awarded in November 1996. AE D, AE E. He submitted employee time \nsheets from February 2006 to August 2009 reflecting steady employment and regular \nattendance. Tr. 80, AE F, AE G. He submitted a letter dated April 27, 2009 from the \nDirector of the Level II Driving With Care Program reflecting enrollment in the program \n\n \n6 \n \n \non February 2, 2007 and completion of the program on April 8, 2008, discussed supra. \nAE H.  \n \nApplicant submitted overtime authorization forms reflecting that he worked \novertime at various times in 2006 and 2007. AE I. He submitted five work-related \ncharacter reference letters. These letters collectively made positive reference to \nApplicant\u2019s work ethic and trustworthiness. AE J. Applicant\u2019s wife also submitted a letter \nstating she was unable to attend the hearing because she had to provide childcare for \ntheir youngest child and her two young grandchildren. She stated in her opinion as a \ncollege graduate majoring in psychology and after reviewing the DSM-IV, her husband \n\u201cdoes not have substance abuse dependency or compulsivity concerning alcohol.\u201d She \nalso added that in the 13 years she has been with her husband, she has never \nobserved him to be \u201cbelligerent, violent, confused or had a cognitive inability to \nunderstand.\u201d AE K.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \n \nThere are seven alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions listed under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n22(a) through 22(g): \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless, of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence;  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \nAfter reviewing the alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions supra, AG \u00b6 \n22(a), is applicable. Applicant\u2019s five alcohol-related arrests from 1985 to 2006, \nspanning a 21-year are not in dispute and clearly warrant application of this \ndisqualifying condition. The government produced substantial evidence supporting this \ndisqualifying condition, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government.1 \n \n \nThere are four alcohol consumption mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n23(a) through 23(d):  \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \n1See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not define the sufficiency of the passage of time, and there is no \n\u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct. Based on my evaluation of \nthe record evidence as a whole,2 to include Applicant\u2019s 21-year history of five alcohol- \nrelated incidents with the 2006 arrest finally being resolved as recently as 2008 when \nhis driver\u2019s license was reinstated, I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply because Applicant does not fully acknowledge \nhis issues of alcohol abuse. He has returned to drinking after completing the Level II \nDriving with Care Program.  \n \nFurthermore, Applicant did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence \nsuggesting he has overcome his problem. The evidence from his witnesses and his \ntestimony that he exercises responsible alcohol use is of limited value absent evidence \nfrom qualified medical authority. The fallout from past misuse of alcohol should be \nevident to him. His history of alcohol-related incidents, current behavior of continuing to \ndrink, and lack of evidence demonstrating that he has overcome his past misuse of \nalcohol, leaves me with doubts that his alcohol consumption problems are \u201cunlikely to \nrecur.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and (d) are clearly inapplicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant told an OPM investigator in January 2008 that it was his intention not to \ndrink alcohol again. Yet, at his hearing he stated that he last consumed alcohol \u201ctwo, \nthree months ago.\u201d He submitted statements of positive work-related references, and \npersonal references supporting the notion that he engages in responsible alcohol use. \n \n2See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). \n   \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nHe has worked in the defense industry since at least March 2006 when he began \nworking for his current defense contractor employer. However, his history suggests that \nhe is unable to fully control or limit his alcohol consumption. \n \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy history of alcohol abuse and the related problems that alcohol \nconsumption has caused him and others leaves me with doubt regarding his eligibility to \nhold a security clearance. Particularly troubling is his return to drinking alcohol and his \nambivalence towards drinking alcohol after his 2006 DUI arrest. His evidence presented \nand his assurances that his alcohol use is under control are insufficient to overcome his \nhistory. Applicant\u2019s future involvement with AA remains unclear. While he is free to \nreject AA, he does not offer an alternative support system. Given his history, more is \nrequired to establish that his drinking problems are under control.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. \nThe evidence leaves me with doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability.   \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. I take this position based on the \nlaw, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful \nconsideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not \neligible for access to classified information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $20,016 for 18 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.r), and that as of July 30, 2009, those debts remained unpaid. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. Having reviewed the pleadings, examined the exhibits, and assessed the testimony provided, I make the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 37 years old, and has worked as a security guard for a defense contractor since January 2007. His co-workers and a supervisor are happy with his job performance, and they recommend him for a position of trust. (Ax. D) He and his wife have been married since August 2008, but have lived together and co-mingled their finances since July 2006. She has two children (ages 19 and 13) from before the marriage. (Tr. 16, 50, 79) Applicant worked as a production technician for a manufacturing company from August 1999 until he was laid off in April 2001. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from September 1989 until August 1993. He held a security clearance for much of his military service. (Gx. 1) When he was discharged, he was given a 30% disability benefit, which paid him about $225 each month. His disability later increased to 60%, and he now receives about $800 each month from the Veterans\u2019 Administration (VA). (Tr. 32, 56) After Applicant was laid off in April 2001, he supported himself on unemployment benefits of about $200 weekly and his 30% disabi",

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn April 5, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his work as\na defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant two sets of interrogatories  to clarify or augment information about\n1\npotentially disqualifying information in his background. After reviewing the results of the\nbackground investigation, as well as Applicant\u2019s responses to the interrogatories, DOHA\nMarch 25, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised adjudicative guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the revised adjudicative guidelines take precedence over the guidelines listed\nin Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nadjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n2\nconsistent with the national interest to allow him access to classified information. On\nJuly 30, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts\nwhich, if established, raise security concerns addressed in the revised adjudicative\nguidelines  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n3\nOn August 24, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on September 21, 2009, and I convened a hearing on\nNovember 20, 2009. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented\nfive exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (Gx.) 1 - 5.\nThe Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented one witness, and proffered three\nexhibits that were admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - C. The\nrecord remained open after the hearing to give Applicant time to provide additional\nrelevant information. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) On December 1,\n2009. The record closed on December 8, 2009, when I received Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submission, which has been admitted without objection as Ax. D.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately\n$20,016 for 18 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.r), and that as of July 30, 2009, those\ndebts remained unpaid. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR\nallegations. Having reviewed the pleadings, examined the exhibits, and assessed the\ntestimony provided, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 37 years old, and has worked as a security guard for a defense\ncontractor since January 2007. His co-workers and a supervisor are happy with his job\nperformance, and they recommend him for a position of trust. (Ax. D) He and his wife\nhave been married since August 2008, but have lived together and co-mingled their\nfinances since July 2006. She has two children (ages 19 and 13) from before the\nmarriage. (Tr. 16, 50, 79) Applicant worked as a production technician for a\nmanufacturing company from August 1999 until he was laid off in April 2001. Applicant\nserved on active duty in the U.S. Army from September 1989 until August 1993. He held\na security clearance for much of his military service. (Gx. 1) When he was discharged,\nhe was given a 30% disability benefit, which paid him about $225 each month. His\ndisability later increased to 60%, and he now receives about $800 each month from the\nVeterans\u2019 Administration (VA). (Tr. 32, 56) \nAfter Applicant was laid off in April 2001, he supported himself on unemployment\nbenefits of about $200 weekly and his 30% disability payments. When his\n\n3\nunemployment ran out in September 2001, he broke the lease for the apartment he was\nrenting and moved in with his mother. Because he was unable to find full-time\nemployment, he decided, in January 2002, to enroll in college. His tuition and expenses\nwere paid by the GI Bill. In December 2004, he received an associate\u2019s degree in\ncriminology. Thereafter, he received VA vocational training as part of his disability\nbenefits. However, until he was hired by his current employer in January 2007, he was\nonly able to find occasional work through brief stints as a temporary agency employee.\n(Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 36 - 38, 41 - 43)\nAt the time he was laid off, Applicant was leasing a car from Chrysler. The lease\nbegan in 1999, but in 2001 he returned the car when it became apparent that he could\nnot keep up with the payments. He was told at the time that he would owe nothing more\non the car, but later received a $1,000 bill. However, a delinquency later appeared on\nhis credit report (Gx. 4) that showed a $5,728 debt to Chrysler (SOR \u00b6 1.k) This is either\na remainder due after resale or the balance due on a lease. Applicant testified that\nwhen he contacted Chrysler about this debt, he again was told that he owed them\nnothing. (Gx. 2; Tr. 29, 51) In support of his claim that he does not owe the debt alleged\nat SOR \u00b6 1.k, he presented a copy of the title of a Chrysler showing Applicant as the\nowner, and that a lien against the car was released in 2003. (Ax. C) This debt still\nappears in Applicant\u2019s credit history as a charged off debt. (Ax. A)\nWhen Applicant broke his apartment lease in 2001, he incurred a debt for $1,050\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e), which is being enforced through a civil judgment that he has not yet paid.\nHe also incurred a $191 debt for unpaid cable television (SOR \u00b6 1.q) and a $325 debt\nfor unpaid phone service (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Also attributable to Applicant are a $1,078 unpaid\ncell phone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.p) and a $443 unpaid insurance bill (SOR \u00b6 1.o). Applicant\nstated that he does not recognize these debts, but also acknowledged that he had cable\nservice around the time he broke the lease, and that at one time he had car insurance\nand cell phone service with the listed creditors. (Gx. 2; Gx. 4; Tr. 64)\nApplicant was engaged to be married until sometime in 2002. Before he broke up\nwith his fiancee, he had financed the purchase of furniture and an engagement ring.\nBoth accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l) remain unpaid and total about $5,090. As to the\njeweler where he bought the ring, that company is out of business. As to the furniture\naccount (SOR 1.h), available information shows this debt was charged off as a business\nloss. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 4)\nIn 1999 or 2000, Applicant\u2019s Chrysler had to be repaired by the dealer. Applicant\nwas under the impression that his warranty or lease agreement covered the cost of a\nrental while his car was in the shop. However, Chrysler did not pay for the rental as he\nexpected and he owes $114, which has been referred for collection. (Gx. 2; Tr. 58 - 60)\nApplicant also owes about $4,337 to Capital One Bank for four unpaid credit card\naccounts. Two of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g) are being enforced by civil judgments.\nThe other two (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.I and 1j) were referred to collection. Applicant insisted he has\nonly had one Capital One account, but the credit report obtained during Applicant\u2019s\nbackground investigation showed four different entries identified by four different\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n4\naccount numbers. The two accounts that are not the subject of civil judgments have\nbeen charged off as business losses. (Gx. 2; Gx. 4)\nOf the remaining debts listed in the SOR, Applicant has no knowledge of unpaid\nthe medical debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.r, which total $1,679. He is trying to get more\ninformation about the $156 unpaid medical debt at SOR \u00b6 1.b, but he insists most of his\nmedical treatment between his Army discharge and the start of his current employment\nwas provided by the VA. Finally, Applicant has no knowledge of the $44 debt listed at\nSOR \u00b6 1.n.\nAround the time he was laid off in 2001, Applicant tried making arrangements\nwith his creditors for repayments or other resolutions. However, he was unsuccessful,\nlargely because he had no money with which to make any reasonable payments. In\n2007, after he met with a government investigator during his background investigation,\nApplicant sought help from a credit counseling service, but they could not help him\nbecause of his low income and because most of his delinquent debts had been written\noff. On December 1, 2009, Applicant enrolled in a debt management plan, but he is\npaying only about $23 each month to satisfy two debts. Applicant also stated that he\nhas disputed some of the debts alleged in the SOR, but he did not provide any\ninformation to support his claims. (Ax. D; Tr. 34, 69 - 71)\nApplicant and his wife together earn between $85,000 and $95,000 each year.\nShe manages their monthly finances and they have greatly reduced their monthly\nexpenses through detailed monitoring of their spending. She testified that they usually\nhave about $1,000 remaining each month after expenses. (Tr. 74 - 79)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n Directive, E3.1.14\n8\n5\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18, Guideline F (financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must prove\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls\nto the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of\npersuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n6\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information\nin favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe Applicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR, thus placing on the\ngovernment the burden of presenting sufficient information to prove those controverted\nfacts.  The government has presented sufficient information to support all of the\n8\n\n6\nallegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a - 1.r; that is, that Applicant accrued $20,016 for 18 delinquent\ndebts. Available information, including his response to interrogatories and his response\nto the SOR, further shows that Applicant has not yet paid or otherwise resolved those\ndebts. Accordingly, the record supports those allegations and requires application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nBy contrast, available information showed that Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nbegan when he was laid off in 2001. He was unable to pay his rent and related\nexpenses, or pay his car note and related expenses. Other debts already in existence\nwhen he became unemployed went unpaid as well. He remained unemployed, in part,\ndue to his choice to go to school, but was still unable to find work for almost three years\nafter he obtained his associates\u2019 degree. However, since finding full-time work in\nJanuary 2007, he has done little to actually pay or otherwise resolve his debts. It is\nunderstandable that credit counseling or debt management services could not help him\nwhen he was making little or no money, but he did not renew his efforts with a debt\nmanagement service until around the time of his hearing.\nApplicant has not documented his claims that he disputed some of his debts, and\nhis claim that he does has no knowledge of the debts that are being enforced through\ncivil judgments is untenable. Without substantial evidence to the contrary, it must be\naccepted that creditors were able to demonstrate to a judge that the Applicant owed but\nhad not paid the debts in question. Accordingly, available information does not support\napplication of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment); AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances); AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control); AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts); or AG \u00b6 20(e) (the\nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is\nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of\nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue). Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns about his finances.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 37 years old, has\nserved his country honorably, and has performed well in his current job. He also\nappears to be in the process of improving his finances. Now that he is married, he has\nboth financial and personal stability that will help him avoid a recurrence of his past\nfinancial problems. However, without better documentation of his efforts, questions\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n9\n See footnote 7, supra. \n10\n7\nremain about his willingness to follow through on his stated intentions to resolve his\npast-due debts. Applicant is not expected to be completely debt free, but he is\nexpected, when able, to act in a reasonable way in response to his adverse financial\ncircumstances. Because he has not done so, a fair and commonsense  evaluation of\n9\nthis record shows that concerns remain about Applicant\u2019s finances, thus perpetuating\nthe doubts raised by the government\u2019s information about his ability or willingness to\nprotect the government\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the national\ninterest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved for the\ngovernment.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor Applicant to have access to classified information.

In 1982, he immigrated to the United \nStates. In 1987, he became a U.S. citizen. His spouse and two children are U.S. \ncitizens. However, he has retained significant connections to Syria. He traveled to Syria \nin 1984, 1995, 1997, 2007, and in June 2009. His parents and parents-in-law live in \nSyria, and he owns a share of some property in Syria. He retains a Syrian identification \ncard. Foreign preference and foreign influence concerns are not mitigated. Access to \nclassified information is denied.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 7, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing or Security Clearance Application (e-QIP version) (hereinafter \nSF-86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On June 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines C (foreign preference) and B (foreign influence) (GE 7). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nDecember 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 15, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (GE 8). On August 3, 2009, Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed. On August 10, 2009, the case was assigned to me. On September \n14, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for October 13, 2009 (GE \n6). The hearing was held on October 13, 2009, as scheduled. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19), and \nApplicant did not offer any exhibits (Tr. 11). There were no objections, and I admitted \nGE 1-5 (Tr. 19). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the hearing \nnotice (GE 6-8). On October 21, 2009, I received the hearing transcript.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of facts concerning Syria \n(Tr. 13). Department Counsel provided supporting documents to show detail and \ncontext for these facts in the Administrative Notice request. Applicant and Department \nCounsel did not object to me taking administrative notice of all of the facts in all of the \ndocuments (Tr. 13). See the Syria section of the Findings of Fact of this decision, infra, \nfor the material facts from Department Counsel\u2019s submissions on Syria.   \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v.

His employer recently moved him into a \nposition where he needs a security clearance (Tr. 22). He does not have a security \nclearance (Tr. 39). In 2006, he earned a PhD in aerospace engineering (Tr. 7). He \nteaches part-time at a university (Tr. 23). In 1997, during a visit to Syria, he married his \nspouse, who is Palestinian (Tr. 29, 30, 32).  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nApplicant was born in Syria, and lived there until he was 22 years old (Tr. 23). He \nmoved to the United States in 1982 (Tr. 23). He married his first spouse in 1982, and \nthey were divorced in 1991 (Tr. 31). In 1987, Applicant was naturalized as a U.S. \ncitizen. His Syrian passport expired in 1984 (Tr. 42-44; GE 3).  \n \nIn 1995, Applicant acquired a Syrian identification card or document (SID) in \norder to avoid using his U.S. passport while traveling in Syria (Tr. 44-45; SOR \u00b6 1.a; GE \n8). He used the SID while traveling in Syria in 1995, 1997, 2007, and June 2009 (Tr. 44, \n49; SOR \u00b6 1.b; GE 8). His SID indicates he lives in a village in Syria (Tr. 46). He used \nhis SID to avoid explaining why he has a U.S. passport at every checkpoint or traffic \nstop (Tr. 44-45; GE 8). His SID minimizes the possibility that he will need to pay a bribe \nor resolve other problems with the police while in transit in Syria (Tr. 45). He did not \nbelieve his SID had expired (Tr. 92-93). He possesses a Syrian driver\u2019s license, which \nexpired in 1989 (Tr. 50-51; SOR \u00b6 1.c; GE 8).2 \n \nApplicant and his brother decided to invest in land so that eventually they would \nhave vacation property in Syria. Applicant obtained his Syrian birth certificate to support \nthe purchase of land in Syria (Tr. 34; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 2.d; GE 8). In September of 2007, \nApplicant borrowed approximately $35,000 against his house in the United States and \nused the funds to purchase a 27 percent interest in some land in Syria (Tr. 25-29, 64-\n65, 90-91). He does not have a mortgage on his property in Syria (Tr. 27). He does not \nown any other Syrian property and does not have any Syrian bank accounts (Tr. 29). \nHis Syrian land does not have a building on it, and he intends to build a vacation home \non it (Tr. 90-91). However, there is the possibility that they might sell the Syrian land (Tr. \n90). Applicant wanted to include his name on the title for the Syrian land to ensure \nApplicant\u2019s children will inherit their share of the property upon his death (GE 8).  \n \nSyrian citizenship is a prerequisite for property ownership in Syria (Tr. 34). \nApplicant\u2019s children will have to apply for Syrian citizenship to inherit the property \nApplicant purchased (Tr. 34). He wanted to have his children obtain Syrian citizenship; \nhowever, he did not want them to serve in the Syrian military, which is compulsory for \nSyrian males (Tr. 65).  \n \n \n2Although his Syrian driver\u2019s license expired two years after Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he \ndid not return to Syria until 1995 and at that time his Syrian driver\u2019s license had expired. If the Syrian \npolice asked him whether he had a Syrian driver\u2019s license, he stated that he would just pay a bribe of \nabout $4 in lieu of providing a Syrian driver\u2019s license (Tr. 51).    \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant did not believe Syrian citizenship could be renounced, and he has not \nattempted to renounce his Syrian citizenship (Tr. 34-35). He did not make any inquiries \nabout renouncing his Syrian citizenship because he did not want to risk the \u201cwrath of the \ngovernment\u201d (Tr. 35).  \n \nIn March 2007, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant about his preference \nfor Syria as compared to the United States. Applicant said his allegiance is eighty \npercent with the United States and twenty percent with Syria (Tr. 67; SOR \u00b6 1.e; GE 3 \nat 15; GE 8). He said he would not want to fight on behalf of the United States against \nSyria; however, he would provide civil service to the United States to assist in the war \neffort (GE 8). He was willing to assist the United States in any war to ensure the U.S. \nvictory; however, he did not want to be in a position of causing direct physical harm to a \nSyrian family member, such as by shooting them (Tr. 70). \n \nApplicant denied that he had divided loyalty (Tr. 71; GE 8). He does not vote in \nU.S. elections and has not voted in Syrian elections (Tr. 101). He denied that the SOR \ncontained evidence of his preference for Syria over the United States (GE 8).  He would \nnot even consider living in any other country than the United States (Tr. 103).   \n \nForeign Influence \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was born in Kuwait (Tr. 32). She became a Palestinian \ncitizen, and then she became a citizen of Morocco through her father\u2019s Moroccan \ncitizenship (Tr. 32, 33). In 2002, she became a U.S. citizen (Tr. 33). His two children are \nages nine and seven, and they were born in the United States (Tr. 7, 33). His children \nlive in the United States, and they attend U.S. schools (Tr. 36).  \n \nApplicant owns a house in the United States valued at about $270,000 (Tr. 24). \nHis equity in the property is about $110,000 (Tr. 25).  He has a retirement fund with his \nU.S. company, which is valued at about $380,000 (Tr. 26). He has a U.S. bank account \nwith about $10,000 in it (Tr. 26). He has about $27,000 in his children\u2019s U.S. education \nfund (Tr. 27). He and his spouse have about $29,000 invested in other U.S. accounts \n(Tr. 28). \n \nApplicant traveled to Syria in 1984, 1995, 1997, 2007, and June 2009 (Tr. 47-50; \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.c). His most recent visit was from June to July 2009 (Tr. 50). In \n1995, a person that he believed was a Syrian intelligence agent or someone in the \nmilitary questioned him (Tr. 51-54; SOR \u00b6 2.a). At that time, he lacked a waiver \nindicating he did not have to serve in the Syrian Army (Tr. 53-58; GE 8). He was \ndetained in a camp, and one of his relatives obtained a waiver of military service for his \nvisit to Syria (Tr. 53-58). Once his temporary waiver was established, Applicant was \nreleased (Tr. 54-59; GE 8). In 2007, he was sent to a Syrian intelligence office on three \noccasions for interviews (Tr. 60-61; SOR \u00b6 2.c; GE 8). They checked with Applicant \nabout when he arrived and when he would depart Syria (Tr. 53-56, 60-61; GE 8). He \nreceived a letter from the Syrian intelligence office authorizing him to leave Syria (Tr. \n53-54).  \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant has not completed his mandatory Syrian military service (Tr. 66). He \nbelieved he could purchase an exemption for about $5,000; however, he was hoping he \nwould not be required to make this financial expenditure (Tr. 66). When visiting Syria, it \nwas important to obtain the temporary waiver discussed in the previous paragraph \nbecause then it was unnecessary to purchase a permanent exemption from military \nservice (Tr. 67).  \n \n Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Syria (Tr. 41; SOR \u00b6 2.e; GE 2 \nat 6; GE 8). In 1990, Applicant\u2019s parents received U.S. permanent resident cards or \n\u201cgreen cards\u201d (Tr. 39-41). Applicant sends about $250 to his parents about every two \nmonths (Tr. 75; SOR \u00b6 2.f; GE 8). Applicant communicates with his parents on a \nquarterly basis, and they visit Applicant in the United States every two or three years \n(GE 2 at 6).   \n \nApplicant has six brothers and four sisters (includes half-brothers and half-\nsisters) (Tr. 37). Four of his brothers live in the United States (Tr. 36-37, 74, 75, 79, 82).  \nOne brother is a citizen of Syria and a resident of Saudi Arabia (Tr. 77-80; SOR \u00b6 2.g; \nGE 8). Another brother is a dual citizen of Syria and the United States, who lives in \nSaudi Arabia (Tr. 42, 77-80; SOR \u00b6 2.h; GE 8). He speaks to his brother in Saudi Arabia \nabout once every two weeks (Tr. 94). Three of Applicant\u2019s sisters are citizens and \nresidents of Syria (Tr. 85-87; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.n and 2.o; GE 8). One sister is a citizen and \nresident of Syria (Tr. 81; SOR \u00b6 2.i; GE 8). Applicant\u2019s aunt (related to his father\u2019s \nsecond wife) is a citizen and resident of Syria (SOR \u00b6 2.k; GE 8). He has numerous \nnieces and nephews, who live in the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. However, \nhe does not frequently communicate with any of his brothers, sisters, nieces, or \nnephews, who live in Syria. \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers is a citizen and resident of Syria, and he is employed \nby the Syrian government (Tr. 83; SOR \u00b6 2.l; GE 8). He is currently assigned or \nemployed outside of Syria (Tr. 83). His brother\u2019s wife is a citizen and resident of Syria, \nand she is employed as a teacher (Tr. 84; SOR \u00b6 2.m; GE 8).     \n  \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens of Palestine and \nMorocco; however, they are residents of Syria (Tr. 88; SOR \u00b6 2.p; GE 8). Applicant\u2019s \nspouse sends her parents $200 to $300 per year as gifts (Tr. 88). She talks to her \nparents about once per week (Tr. 88). She also talks to her brother, who is a citizen and \nresident of Syria, about once a month (Tr. 89). Her brother is employed by the Syrian \ngovernment (SOR \u00b6 2.j; GE 8). \n \nApplicant concluded his hearing statement by emphasizing his commitment and \npreference for the United States over all other countries stating: \u201cI love this place. I love \nthis country. This is the country of my children, [it is] my country now, my adopted \ncountry, and now I leave it with that.\u201d (Tr. 113).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nCharacter Evidence \n \nThere is no derogatory information concerning Applicant\u2019s police or financial \nrecords.3 He has never been fired from a job. There is no evidence that he has ever \nbeen arrested, used illegal drugs, or been involved in an alcohol-related incident. There \nis no evidence of any security violations, or work-related rule violations.  \n \nSyria4 \n \nSyria borders on Iraq, Israel, Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Syria is approximately \nthe same size as North Dakota. Syria\u2019s population is about 19 million people. \n \nOfficially Syria is a republic; however, in reality it is ruled by an authoritarian \nregime. Syria is included on the U.S. State Department's List of State Sponsors of \nTerrorism. There are several known terrorist groups in Syria. The government of Syria \ncontinues to provide political and material support to Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorist \ngroups. Several terrorist groups maintain their offices and some of their leadership in \nSyria. In addition, the government of Syria permits Iran to transfer weapons and \nsupplies through their country to assist terrorists in Lebanon. Syria is one of the main \ntransit points for foreign fighters entering Iraq. A travel warning for Syria warns about \nthe risks of terrorism due to the September 2006 attack on the U.S. embassy in \nDamascus. Syrian forces killed the four individuals who attacked the U.S. embassy in \n2006. There have been other attacks on the U.S. Ambassador's residence and the U.S. \nembassy in 1998 and 2000. \n \nThe United States instituted economic sanctions against Syria due to their active \nand passive support of terrorism in the Middle East. No commercial aircraft owned or \noperated by the Syrian government may take off or land in the United States. There are \nhuman rights abuses in Syria that include: systematic repression of Syrian citizens' \nability to peacefully change the government; arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life; \ntorture and physical abuse of prisoners and detainees; arbitrary arrests and detentions; \nrestrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association; government \ncorruption; and violence and discrimination against women. Torture is occasionally \nused, including against foreign citizens. Security personnel have placed foreign visitors \nunder surveillance, have monitored telephones, and have searched hotel rooms and \npossessions of foreign citizens.  \n \n \nSyria opposed the Iraq war in 2003, and foreign relations between Syria and the \nUnited States deteriorated. In 2005, the United States withdrew its ambassador to Syria \nafter the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri.   \n \n \n \n3 The source for the facts in this paragraph is his security clearance application (GE 1). \n \n4The facts in the section concerning Syria are from the Department Counsel\u2019s documents \nsubmitted for Administrative Notice and U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, \nBackground Note: Syria, May 2007 (Enclosure I). \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon meeting the criteria \ncontained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Adverse clearance decisions are made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [a]pplicant concerned.\u201d See \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines C (foreign preference) and B (foreign influence) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 describes the foreign preference security concern stating, \u201cwhen an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other \nsuch benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \nIn 1987, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. He continues to retain a Syrian \nidentification card or document (SID). He retains the SID for convenience when he visits \nSyria. He used his SID during his visits to Syria, or had it available for use, if he was \nstopped by the Syrian police. He retained the SID to avoid questions about why he was \nin Syria, and his presentation of a U.S. passport to Syrian traffic police would cause \nproblems and possibly detention until his status was verified. He retained his Syrian \ncitizenship to protect his interest in his Syrian property either for himself or for his \nchildren\u2019s potential inheritance. His SID shows his residence as a Syrian village, rather \nthan his address in the United States. AG \u00b6 10(a)(5) applies.  \n \nWhen Applicant obtained a Syrian birth certificate as indicated in SOR \u00b6 1.d, he \ndid not implicate a security concern under Guideline C. The issue of his Syrian birth \ncertificate is more appropriately resolved under Guideline B. Applicant\u2019s expression in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e of an 80 percent allegiance to the United States and a 20 percent allegiance \nto Syria is not an expression of preference for Syria over the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nhearing statement clarified that the 20 percent allocation for Syria does not mean he \nwould make any decision against U.S. interests. However, his retention of Syrian \ncitizenship as manifested by retention of a current Syrian SID, retention of a Syrian birth \ncertificate, and retention of an ownership interest in land located in Syria does show \nsome foreign influence and whole person concerns, which are addressed beginning at \npage 10, infra.   \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nAG \u00b6 11(e) applies and mitigates any concern about Applicant\u2019s possession of a \nSyrian driver\u2019s license. His Syrian driver\u2019s license is expired and was never valid while \nhe was in Syria after becoming a U.S. citizen. None of the other mitigating conditions \nfully apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.      \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(d), and 7(e) apply. Applicant, his parents, his parents-in-law, \nhis brothers, sisters, and numerous nieces and nephews were born in Syria. Many of \nthem of them live in Syria or have close connections with family members living in Syria. \nOne brother-in-law is a Syrian government official. Applicant has particularly close \nconnections with his mother and father. His spouse has close connections to her \nparents and brother.  He shares living quarters with his spouse. Applicant has an \ninterest in property in Syria amounting to about $35,000.   \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s communications with most of his siblings and other relatives \nliving in Syria are not particularly frequent, he does have a sufficient relationship with his \nparents because of communications, visits, and his payment of funds to raise a \nconcern. His spouse has frequent, non-casual communications with her parents living in \nSyria, and provides funds to them. She has frequent (monthly) communications with her \nbrother. \u201c[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has not \nrebutted this presumption. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents, his wife\u2019s \nrelationship with her parents, and her relationship with her brother are sufficient to \ncreate \u201ca heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion.\u201d These relationships with residents of Syria create a potential conflict of \ninterest between Applicant\u2019s \u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology \nand [his] desire to help\u201d any family members who are in Syria. For example, if terrorists \nor the Syrian Government wanted to expose Applicant to coercion, they could exert \npressure on his parents. Applicant is also subject to potential, indirect coercion through \nhis spouse\u2019s relationship with her parents and her brother. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a family member living in Syria, is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant has a \nclose relationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See Generally ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United \nStates. The relationship of Syria with the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his family members living in Syria, and his spouse\u2019s relationships with her family \nmembers living in Syria, do not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into \na position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \na desire to assist a family member living in Syria, or to assist his spouse, who might be \ncoerced through a family member living in Syria.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \n \nApplicant has an 27 percent interest in a property in Syria that he purchased in \nSeptember 2007 for about $35,000. This interest is sufficient to raise a security concern \nunder AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Syria seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, his spouse, or their \nfamily members living in Syria, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities, and \nSyria has a problem with terrorism. Applicant\u2019s relationship with family members living in \nSyria, or who are very likely to return to Syria, creates a potential conflict of interest \nbecause this relationship is sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire \nto assist his spouse, or their family members living in Syria should they be endangered \nby terrorists by providing sensitive or classified information. Department Counsel \nproduced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with his parents or his spouse\u2019s \ncontacts with her parents living in Syria and has raised the issue of potential foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(d), and 7(e) apply, and further \ninquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) have limited applicability. Applicant traveled to Syria in 1984, \n1995, 1997, 2007, and June 2009. His visit from June to July 2009 was recent and of \nsubstantial duration. He was repeatedly interviewed by either Syrian intelligence or \nmilitary personnel. He has never served in the Syrian military and is vulnerable to \nconscription or being forced to pay for a waiver of military service. Applicant has \nfrequent contact with his parents, who live in Syria. However, he does not have frequent \ncontacts with his siblings who live in Syria. His relationships with his siblings in Syria are \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 8(c) because his contacts and communication with them are so \ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. However, because of his connections to Syria, to his parents, \nand to his in-laws, Applicant is not able to fully meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle \nlikelihood that [his relationships with his relatives who are Syria citizens] could create a \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d    \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has strong \nfamily connections to the United States. His spouse, two children, and two brothers live \nin the United States. His spouse and two children are all U.S. citizens. Applicant owns a \nhouse in the United States, has substantial investments in the United States, and has a \nbank account in the United States.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with his family members who \neither live in Syria or spend extended periods of time visiting Syria. He frequently \ncommunicates with his parents and less frequently with his siblings. His spouse \nfrequently communicates with her parents and brother. There is no evidence, however, \nthat terrorists, criminals, the Syrian Government, or those conducting espionage have \napproached or threatened Applicant or his family in Syria to coerce Applicant or his \nfamily for classified or sensitive information. As such, there is a reduced possibility that \nApplicant or Applicant\u2019s family would be specifically selected as targets for improper \ncoercion or exploitation. While the government does not have any burden to prove the \npresence of such evidence, if such record evidence was present, Applicant would have \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                             \na heavy evidentiary burden to overcome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns. \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 contentious recent relationship with \nSyria, and especially Syria\u2019s support for terrorist groups and systematic human rights \nviolations. Syria\u2019s conduct makes it more likely that Syria would coerce Applicant \nthrough his family, if Syria determined it was advantageous to do so.     \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(d), and 8(e) do not apply. The U.S. Government has not encouraged \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with family members living in Syria. Applicant is not required to \nreport his contacts with family members living in Syria. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) applies to mitigate the security concern raised by his property interest \nin Syria. In comparison to his property interests in the United States, and his \nemployment in the United States, the value of his property in Syria is such that it is \nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, \nor pressure him. However, this mitigating condition can only fully mitigate security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \nIn sum, the primary security concern is Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his \nparents, and his spouse\u2019s relationships with her parents and brother. These relatives \nlive in Syria and are readily available for coercion. A lesser concern remains because of \nhis trips to Syria, his use of the SID to avoid inquiries from traffic police, and his \ncontacts with Syrian intelligence or military officials. His contacts with Syrian intelligence \nor military officials and multiple trips to Syria highlight their knowledge of Applicant, and \nraise his profile while in Syria. The Syrian government\u2019s antipathy towards the United \nStates and failure to follow the rule of law further increase the risk of coercion.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines C and B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under this guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nThere are some facts supporting mitigation of security concerns. Applicant \nimmigrated to the United States in 1982. Applicant received his post-graduate education \nin the United States. In 1987, he became a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s spouse became a \nU.S. citizen in 2002. His two children were born in the United States. His children live in \nthe United States, and they attend U.S. schools. Two of his brothers and their families \nlive in the United States. \n \nApplicant has substantial property and employment connections to the United \nStates. The same U.S. defense contractor has employed him for 19 years. His house in \nthe United States is valued at about $270,000. His equity in the property is about \n$110,000.  He has a retirement fund with his U.S. company, which is valued at about \n$380,000. He has a U.S. bank account with about $10,000 in it. He has about $27,000 \nin his children\u2019s U.S. education fund. He and his spouse have about $29,000 invested in \nother U.S. accounts. \n \nApplicant does not have frequent contacts with his siblings who live in Syria. \nThere is no derogatory information concerning his police or financial records. He has \nnever been fired from a job. There is no evidence of record showing any U.S. arrests, \nillegal drug possession or use, or alcohol-related incidents. He loves the United States \nand wants to raise his children in the United States. He considers the United States to \nbe his home, and not Syria.  \n \nThe circumstances tending to support denial of a clearance for Applicant are \nmore significant than the factors weighing towards grant of his clearance. Some of \nApplicant\u2019s brothers and sisters, as well as his parents, parents-in-law, and brother-in-\nlaw live in Syria. He has frequent contact with his parents and provides funds to them. \nHis spouse has frequent contact with her parents and brother, and provides funds to her \nparents. He traveled to Syria in 1984, 1995, 1997, 2007, and in June 2009. He owns a \nshare of some property in Syria. He retains a Syrian identification card. Syrian \nintelligence or military officials have repeatedly detained and questioned him.    \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Syria must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Syria, as well as the dangers existing in Syria.5 The danger of \nviolence or coercion from terrorists in Syria and the threat of coercion from the Syrian \ngovernment makes coercion and abuse more likely than in many other countries. \nTerrorists continue to threaten the interests of the United States, as well as those who \ncooperate and assist the United States. Syria has provided support for terrorist groups \nand shown some hostility towards United States efforts in Iraq, Israel, Palestine, and \nLebanon.       \n \nAfter weighing all the facts and circumstances in this decision, including \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor, sincerity, and honesty at his hearing, I conclude he has not \nmitigated the foreign preference or foreign influence security concerns. \n \n \n5 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for \naccess to classified information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c to 1.e: \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant (duplicates 2.c) \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e and 2.f: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.g to 2.i:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.k to 2.o: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have used marijuana after he had been granted a clearance in about February 2002 (SOR 2.a) and after he had submitted his security clearance application on November 26, 2007 (SOR 2.b); to have falsified his November 2007 application by 4 responding \u201cno\u201d to the illegal drug inquiry in question 24.a (SOR 2.c), and as noted above, to have also falsified his February 2002 security clearance application by responding \u201cno\u201d to the drug inquiry and not disclosing that he had used marijuana on at least two occasions in about 2000 (SOR 2.d). Applicant admitted that he had used marijuana, but only from 1989 to 1993. He also admitted the purchase of marijuana and his arrest in 1993. He denied any involvement with marijuana after he had been issued his security clearance in February 2002 or after he had completed his latest e-QIP in November 2007.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Thomas Albin, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant smoked marijuana, with varying frequency up to twice a month at\ntimes, from age 17 to July 1993, again twice in about 2000, and once during the last\nquarter of 2007. Applicant does not intend to use any illegal drug in the future, and he is\nnot likely to jeopardize his job by using drugs. Personal conduct concerns that arise\nbecause of his deliberate omission of drug involvement from his February 2002 SF 86\nare not mitigated. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on November 26, 2007. On February 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\nBefore the introduction of any evidence at the hearing, I corrected a typographical error in my order\n1\nof June 11, 2009, to clarify that the SOR had been amended to add a new allegation 2.d (which was the\nsubject of the original motion to amend) and not  2.e.\nBoth the Motion to Amend and the Amended Motion to Amend contain incorrect social security\n2\nnumbers for the Applicant. \n2\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant received the SOR on February 10, 2009, and he submitted an undated\nanswer in which he requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on April 2, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. On June 2, 2009, I\nscheduled a hearing for June 17, 2009.\nOn June 10, 2009, Department Counsel filed an Amended Motion to Amend the\nSOR, referencing a Motion to Amend dated March 20, 2009, which was provided to me\nfor the first time on June 11, 2009. After considering the respective positions of the\nparties, I granted the amended motion in part, infra.1\nThe hearing was held as scheduled. The government submitted five exhibits (Ex.\n1-5), which were entered into evidence without any objections, and offered the\ntestimony of a government investigator. Applicant submitted one exhibit (Ex. A), also\nentered with no objections, and he and three witnesses testified on his behalf. A\ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on June 29, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nOn March 20, 2009, the government forwarded a Motion to Amend the SOR to\nApplicant, seeking to add a new allegation 2.d under Guideline E to allege that he\nfalsified his February 2002 security clearance application (SF 86) by not disclosing that\nhe had used marijuana on at least two occasions in about 1999 or 2000. The motion\nwas not included in the file forwarded to me on April 2, 2009.\nBefore the hearing was formally scheduled, but after Applicant was provided\nthrough discovery with a copy of the motion, the case was transferred to the presently\nassigned Department Counsel. She moved on June 10, 2009, in an Amended Motion to\nAmend,  to change proposed allegation 2.d, which was the subject of the original\n2\nmotion, to indicate that Applicant deliberately did not disclose that he had used\nmarijuana \u201con at least two occasions in about 2000.\u201d Furthermore, Department Counsel\nsought to add two new Guideline E security concerns (2.e and 2.f) to allege that\nApplicant also falsified his February 2002 SF 86 and his November 2007 e-QIP by\ndeliberately failing to disclose his July 1993 arrest for possession of marijuana.\nApplicant through his attorney objected to the Amended Motion to Amend citing the lack\n\nThe November 26, 2007, security clearance application was referred to as a Questionnaire for\n3\nNational Security Positions (Standard Form 86) in SOR 2.c. The QNSP is a form included within the e-QIP.\n3\nof reasonable notice,  given the hearing was to be held within the week and the\ngovernment was not relying on newly discovered information. Applicant\u2019s counsel\nconceded on June 11, 2009, that Applicant had not been prejudiced in his ability to\nrespond to the original motion concerning SOR 2.d.\nOn June 11, 2009, Department Counsel provided me with a copy of the original\nMotion to Amend and Applicant\u2019s objections. After considering the parties\u2019 respective\npositions, I granted the amended motion to the extent that 2.d, as newly drafted,\nclarified the concern that had been the subject of the March 20, 2009, motion of which\nApplicant had adequate notice. Accordingly, the SOR was amended to add a new\nsubparagraph 2.d under Guideline E, as follows:\n2.d. You falsified material facts on a Security Clearance Application,\nStandard Form 86, signed by you on February 6, 2002, in response to\nQuestion 27 which asks \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,\nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for\nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium,\nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc.), \namphetamines, \ndepressants\n(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogens (LSD,\nPCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?.\u201d You answered \u201cno\u201d and deliberately\nfailed to disclose that you had used marijuana on at least two occasions in\nabout 2000.\nApplicant\u2019s objections were sustained as to proposed SOR 2.e and 2.f. The government\npossessed the documents upon which the allegations were based as of March 20,\n2009, if not when the SOR was issued on February 3, 2009. Previously assigned\nDepartment Counsel reviewed the documents, and with discovery to Applicant, filed a\nmotion to amend which could have included allegations similar to proposed 2.e and 2.f\nbut did not. Transfer of the case to a government counsel who views the evidence\ndifferently is not good cause to add new allegations at the eleventh hour.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement,\nthat Applicant used marijuana from about 1989 to 1993 and from 2000 to at least after\nabout November 2007 (SOR 1.a), including after he had been granted a security\nclearance in about February 2002 and after he had submitted his security clearance\napplication  on November 26, 2007 (SOR 1.d); that he purchased marijuana (SOR 1.b);\n3\nand that he was arrested in July 1992 for possession of marijuana and possession of\nfireworks and fined (SOR 1.c). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was\nalleged to have used marijuana after he had been granted a clearance in about\nFebruary 2002 (SOR 2.a) and after he had submitted his security clearance application\non November 26, 2007 (SOR 2.b); to have falsified his November 2007 application by\n\n4\nresponding \u201cno\u201d to the illegal drug inquiry in question 24.a (SOR 2.c), and as noted\nabove, to have also falsified his February 2002 security clearance application by\nresponding \u201cno\u201d to the drug inquiry and not disclosing that he had used marijuana on at\nleast two occasions in about 2000 (SOR 2.d).\nApplicant admitted that he had used marijuana, but only from 1989 to 1993. He\nalso admitted the purchase of marijuana and his arrest in 1993. He denied any\ninvolvement with marijuana after he had been issued his security clearance in February\n2002 or after he had completed his latest e-QIP in November 2007. Applicant also\ndenied the falsification allegations. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntranscript, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 36-year-old rigger who has worked for a defense contractor since\nMarch 2002 (Ex. 1). He had previously served on active duty in the U.S. military from\nApril 1994 to September 2000, and held a secret-level security clearance (Ex. 1, Tr.\n125). That clearance was restored to him in about February 2002 for his duties with his\ncurrent employer (Ex. 1, Tr. 126).\nApplicant began using marijuana in about 1989 when he was 17 years old. He\nsmoked it twice a month at times, some months not at all, until July 1993 (Ex. 4, Tr.\n128-29), when during a traffic stop, he was arrested for possession of marijuana on his\nperson and illegal fireworks in his vehicle (Tr. 115). He submitted a urinalysis sample at\nthe station which was positive for marijuana (Ex. 4). He was charged only with\npossession of marijuana and illegal fireworks (Ex. 5). On the advice of his attorney, he\nsubmitted to weekly drug screens at a local clinic for three months and obtained\ncounseling. In October 1993, he was sentenced to a six month diversion program, six\nmonths license suspension, and a fine. He paid his fines, and completed the screening\nprogram. In April 1994, the charges were dismissed (Ex. 5). He understood from the\njudge that the offense was expunged and would not be on his record (Ex. 4, Tr. 117,\n119). Applicant stopped using marijuana after his arrest because he planned to enter\nthe U.S. military (Ex. 4).\nApplicant discussed his 1993 arrest with his military recruiter, but he did not\nmention his use of marijuana in high school (Tr. 146). In March 1994, he was accepted\nfor enlistment under a delayed enlistment program (Ex. 4, Tr. 120). He completed a\nsecurity clearance application (National Agency Questionnaire) on March 4, 1994. He\ndisclosed the 1993 drug charge in response to question 19 concerning any arrests.\nApplicant also checked \u201cYes\u201d in response to question 20.a concerning whether he had\never used or possessed any controlled drug except as prescribed by a licensed\nphysician, and added under the remarks section that he had smoked marijuana one\ntime in July 1993 (\u201cexperiment use\u201d) and did not intend to use marijuana in the future\n\nApplicant now denies that he wrote \u201cone-time\u201d use of marijuana on his NAQ (Tr. 151). He was either\n4\nunable or unwilling to indicate who had indicated that he used marijuana only once (\u201cI would have to guess\nthat either my recruiter or someone at the MEPS office in New York wrote that.\u201d) (Tr. 151-52). Even assuming\nthat it was in his recruiter\u2019s handwriting, it is reasonable to assume that the recruiter wrote what Applicant told\nhim. Furthermore, Applicant signed the form certifying that his responses were accurate to the best of his\nknowledge and belief.\n5\n(Ex. 2).  Applicant was granted a secret clearance for his duties in about July 1994 (Ex.\n4\n1).\nApplicant abstained from illicit substance use for the duration of his active duty\nservice. He received the National Defense Service Medal, two Meritorious Unit\nCommendations, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Second Good Conduct\nAward, and deployment ribbon for his service (Ex. 4). In April 2000, he and his spouse\nmarried (Ex. 1). They had a son in August 2000, and in September 2000, Applicant was\nhonorably discharged from active duty into the reserves (Ex. 4).\nAfter a few months of unemployment, Applicant worked as a calibration\ntechnician for a local company until March 2002, when he started with his present\nemployer. Before he reported for work with the defense contractor, he executed a\nsecurity clearance application (SF 86) on February 6, 2002. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to\nquestion 27 concerning any illegal use of a controlled substance since age 16 or in the\nlast 7 years. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24 concerning whether he had ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs. He was\ngranted a secret clearance for his duties (Ex. 1).\nIn conjunction with a periodic reinvestigation of his security clearance, Applicant\nexecuted an e-QIP on November 26, 2007. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 23.d\nregarding whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense related to\nalcohol or drugs. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24.a concerning the illegal use of a\ncontrolled substance, including marijuana, since the age of 16 or in the last seven\nyears, whichever was shorter (Ex. 1).\nOn February 1, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a contract investigator for the\nU.S. government about the unlisted charges of possession of marijuana and illegal\nfireworks in 1993. The investigator took notes during the interview, which she then read\nback to Applicant to confirm their accuracy (Tr. 42, 131). After the interview, she\ngenerated a written report based on those notes (Tr. 33-35, 43). The investigator\nreported that Applicant had told her that he had not disclosed his 1993 arrest for\nmarijuana possession \u201con his case papers\u201d because he had been told by the judge that\nhe would not have a record after he completed the drug screening program and paid his\nfines. She also reported that Applicant had detailed marijuana use from age 17 twice\nmonthly until his arrest in July 1993, that he had quit smoking marijuana due to his\nupcoming entry into the Navy, but also that he had used marijuana three times after he\nwas discharged from the military: twice when he first got out, and once four months ago\nwith an old friend named Pat. The investigator further reported, \u201cSUBJECT\nANSWERED \u2018NO\u2019 TO USING MARIJUANA WHILE POSSESSING A SECURITY\n\n6\nCLEARANCE IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS ON HIS CASE PAPERS DUE TO\nSUBJECT USED THE MARIJUANA AFTER COMPLETING THE CASE PAPERS\u201d (all\ncapitals in original). Applicant denied any intent to use marijuana in the future (Ex. 4). \nIn September 2008, Applicant was asked by DOHA to review the report of his\nFebruary 2008 subject interview and to verify its accuracy. On September 29, 2008,\nApplicant indicated that the report of investigation did not accurately reflect the\ninformation he had provided to the investigator. He explained that he had omitted his\n1993 arrest because he did not think he had a record, as the judge had indicated that\noffense would be expunged. Citing his defense contractor employment and family\nresponsibilities, he maintained he had no room for alcohol or drugs in his life. With\nregard to illegal drug involvement, he submitted the following corrections:\nSubject may have smoked marijuana twice monthly, some months not at\nall from age 17 until 07/93 incident.\nSubject bought marijuana three times in dime bag form, and/or 1/8 ounce\npackage before 07/93 incident.\nSubject last drove after smoking marijuana at time of incident 07/93 and\ndoes feel effects of driving.\n(Ex. 4). Nowhere in his response to DOHA interrogatories did Applicant specifically\nchallenge the accuracy of the investigator\u2019s report concerning admissions by him of\nmarijuana use in 1999 or 2000 and in 2007. And he did not challenge that he had\nomitted his most recent use of marijuana from his November 2007 e-QIP because it\nhappened after he completed his security clearance application.\nWhen he responded to the SOR, and at his hearing, Applicant denied that he had\nused any marijuana after his arrest in July 1993 (Tr. 129, 136, 138, 141), and he\nattributed any reference to him using marijuana after 1993 to an \u201cinaccurate timeline of\nevents on the investigation report.\u201d (Tr. 130).  He admitted that he used marijuana in\nhigh school, but on a random basis, once in awhile (Tr. 145). When asked why he had\nlisted only that he had used marijuana once in July 1993 on his 1994 NAQ, Applicant\nresponded that the statement was not in his handwriting and it was 16 years ago (Tr.\n157). Applicant denied ever telling the investigator that he had omitted his marijuana\nuse from his November 2007 e-QIP because it happened after he had completed the\nform (Tr. 192). He attributed his failure to correct that claimed inaccuracy to not being\nthorough enough (Tr. 195). Applicant testified he had not raised the issue of any\ninaccuracies in the investigator\u2019s report with the investigator because he didn\u2019t have any\nway of contacting her (Tr. 196). He does not recall receiving a business card from the\ninvestigator (Tr. 200).\nFor her part, the investigator was unable to recall her interview with Applicant (Tr.\n31, 35). She testified that the report of her interview with Applicant was written in her\n\u201cusual style\u201d (Tr. 32, 38). She described her normal procedure in conducting the\n\n7\ninterview, asking questions according to a prescribed format (Tr. 38), taking notes on\nwhat was said to her, reviewing the notes with the subject of the interview (Tr. 34, 42),\nleaving a business card with her name with the subject (Tr. 44), and following the\ninterview,  typing up a report directly with no deviation from the notes taken during the\ninterview (Tr. 34-35). There is no indication that the investigator had any motive to\nreport other than what Applicant told her or to indicate inadvertent error in her reporting\nthe substance of her interview with Applicant. Applicant\u2019s denials of any drug abuse\nafter July 1993 are less credible.\nApplicant has been an excellent worker for the defense contractor (Ex. A). His\ngeneral foreman and his direct supervisor have no complaints about his professionalism\nor dedication to his duties. He sets an example for his peers (Tr. 69) and is considered\na \u201cvaluable asset\u201d (Tr. 85, 88). Applicant informed his direct supervisor that the\ngovernment has raised allegations of marijuana use by him in the present decade but\nthat there is no truth to the allegations (Tr. 93). Applicant wants to retain his\nemployment which he understands he will lose if his clearance is not maintained (Tr.\n190).\nApplicant coaches youth sports (soccer, basketball) in his local community. He is\nalso involved with scouting (Tr. 98-102, 143). A neighbor who has known him for the\npast six or seven years was given the impression that the information of security\nconcern related to a 1993 incident which \u201cgot dated as if it was today and that wasn\u2019t\nthe case.\u201d (Tr. 109). \nApplicant does not currently associate with any known drug users. He does not\nintend to use any illegal drug in the future (Tr. 184, 189).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n8\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d Applicant admits that he smoked marijuana from age 17 until his arrest in\nJuly 1993 for illegal possession. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d applies.  He also admits\nthat he purchased marijuana on three occasions up to July 1993, so AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal\ndrug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d also applies.\nApplicant denies any use of marijuana after his arrest in July 1993. However,\nrepresentations of more recent drug use, made by him during his subject interview of\nFebruary 2008, are considered more credible than his claim that the investigator\nsomehow erred in reporting the time line of his drug use. As reflected in Exhibit 4, a\ncontract investigator for the government reported that Applicant told her he smoked\nmarijuana twice shortly after his discharge from the military and once about four months\nbefore his February 2008 interview. Any use of marijuana by him during the last quarter\n\n9\nof 2007 would have occurred while he was a defense contractor employee with a secret\nclearance (see AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance\u201d). While the investigator could not recall her interview of Applicant, she\nrecognized the report of interview as written by her in her usual style. She testified\nabout required procedures, including that notes taken during questioning are reviewed\nwith the interviewee, and that a report is then prepared from those notes. Applicant\nacknowledged that the investigator read her notes back to him, albeit he claims \u201cvery\nbriefly\u201d (Tr. 131). Since the investigator was required to type the report herself from the\nnotes (Tr. 46), confusion or misunderstanding is less likely. The investigator had no\nmotive to misrepresent what Applicant told her. Applicant had an opportunity to review\nthe investigator\u2019s report in September 2008. His correction, that he \u201cmay have smoked\nmarijuana twice monthly, some months not at all from age 17 until 07/93 incident,\u201d is not\na clear denial of any drug use after July 1993. Furthermore, his explanation for not\nlisting his marijuana use on his November 2007 e-QIP (that it had not yet happened)\nimplies that he had used marijuana within months of his interview and after completion\nof his e-QIP. Most importantly, he agreed with, and adopted, the investigator\u2019s summary\nwithout clarifying or denying the statement that he omitted his marijuana use from his e-\nQIP because it occurred after he completed the form. \nIt is difficult to conclude that Applicant acted in good faith in light of his history of\nincomplete disclosure about his marijuana involvement, including on his 1994 NAQ, and\nhis minimization of his drug abuse at his hearing. He told the investigator he used\nmarijuana twice monthly. In September 2008, he told DOHA that he \u201cmay have smoked\nmarijuana twice monthly, some months not at all\u201d before his arrest. When asked at his\nhearing about his marijuana use in high school, he testified, that it was random, once in\nawhile (Tr. 145),  and he denied any use of marijuana after 1993. AG \u00b6 25(g) applies\nbecause of his use of marijuana in 2007. It is unclear whether he held a security\nclearance when he abused the marijuana shortly after his discharge from the Navy. He\nwas unemployed from his discharge in September 2000 to March 2001 and then\nworked as a calibration technician in the civilian sector until March 2002.\nGiven the evidence of relatively recent marijuana involvement in 2007 after he\nhad abstained since about 2000, AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\ndoes not apply in mitigation. But AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any\ndrugs in the future,\u201d applies. Applicant is no longer associating with drug users (AG \u00b6\n26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts\u201d). While he has not\nexecuted the signed statement required under AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \u201ca signed statement of\nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation,\u201d he has expressed a\ncredible intent to abstain from future illegal drug use. There is nothing about his present\nactivities involving his son and family that is conducive to drug use and he is not likely to\nrisk his employment by using marijuana in the future. There is no evidence that he\nsought out marijuana on the very limited occasions that he used it after he was\ndischarged from active duty. His involvement with marijuana while he held a security\n\n10\nclearance is not condoned, but it also appears to be an aberration in an otherwise\nstable, law-abiding lifestyle. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nDOHA alleged personal conduct concerns because Applicant smoked marijuana\nafter he had been granted a security clearance in 2002 (SOR 2.a) and after he had\nsubmitted his e-QIP on November 26, 2007 (SOR 2.b). Applicant told a government\ninvestigator that he used marijuana four months before his February 1, 2008, interview.\nHe also told the investigator that he had not listed this marijuana use on his e-QIP\nbecause it occurred after he completed the e-QIP, which would have been only a couple\nof months before his interview. If Applicant smoked marijuana after he submitted his\nNovember 2007 e-QIP (SOR 2.b), then he could not have falsified his November 2007\ne-QIP by failing to disclose that abuse (SOR 2.c). It is more likely that the four months\nwas an estimate, and that he last smoked marijuana after he completed his November\n2007 e-QIP.  Applicant displayed poor judgment within the general concerns underlying\nGuideline E when he used marijuana while he held a security clearance, and after he\ncompleted his November 2007 e-QIP, but those concerns are more appropriately\naddressed under Guideline H, supra.\nThe government did not establish that Applicant falsified his November 2007 e-\nQIP by failing to disclose illegal drug use in the preceding seven years (SOR 2.c).\nApplicant reported to the investigator that he stopped smoking marijuana after his arrest\nin July 1993 due to his intended enlistment in the military. He reported using marijuana\nthree times after his discharge, which he recalled to be in 1999 or 2000, including just\nafter he was separated from active duty. Records of his discharge from active duty (Ex.\n4) show he was discharged on September 19, 2000. His marijuana use could have\noccurred after his discharge but before late November 2000, and it would have been\noutside of the seven-year scope of question 24.a on the November 26, 2007. Yet, that\nuse would clearly have fallen within the time frame covered by the drug inquiry on his\nFebruary 6, 2002, SF 86 (SOR 2.d). Applicant responded \u201cNO\u201d to question 27, \u201cSince\nthe age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any\ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants\n(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\nprescription drugs?\u201d His failure to report his abuse of marijuana in 2000 on his February\n2002 SF 86 is reasonably inferred to have been knowing and deliberate. The security\n\n11\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d are established.\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. The evidence shows Applicant has a\nhistory of misrepresentation concerning his illegal drug involvement which extends to\nthe present. When he completed his NAQ for his first clearance in March 1994, he\nresponded \u201cYes\u201d to question 20 concerning whether he had ever tried, used, or\npossessed any narcotic, depressant, hallucinogen, or cannabis, but indicated only the\nuse one-time in July 1993 on the occasion of his arrest. He did not disclose on the form\nthat he had smoked marijuana in high school. This drug abuse was recent and should\nhave been reported. Even if that particular statement was not in his handwriting, he\nsigned the form certifying that his response to the drug inquiry was accurate when it\nwas not. Applicant admitted at his hearing that he had not informed his military recruiter\nabout his use of marijuana in high school, which lends credence to a finding of\ndeliberate concealment as well on the NAQ. Applicant subsequently falsified his\nFebruary 2002 SF 86 by denying any illegal drug use in the last seven years as alleged\nin SOR 2.d. As noted, the evidence does not conclusively establish that he falsified his\nNovember 2007 e-QIP, but he was not candid when he responded to the SOR or at his\nhearing about his drug involvement after July 1993. His failure to provide a candid\nstatement at his hearing concerning his drug use casts \u201cdoubt on [his] reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.\u201d\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n\n12\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana in high school is attributed to his immaturity and\npeer pressure. His abuse of marijuana on three occasions since September 2000, most\nrecently during the last quarter of 2007, casts doubt about his personal judgment.\nHowever, his drug abuse was situational and not characteristic of his lifestyle, which has\nrevolved around his son\u2019s activities (scouting, youth sports) and work as an\naccomplished rigger. Personal conduct concerns persist because of his ongoing lack of\ncandor about his history of illegal drug involvement.  Applicant was not completely\nforthcoming about his drug abuse when he first applied for a security clearance for his\nwork with his present employer. The ameliorative impact of his disclosures during his\nFebruary 2008 interview have been undermined by recent retractions of his previous\nadmissions. While his illegal drug use is not likely to recur, I am not persuaded that\nApplicant has been \u201crailroaded\u201d because of \u201csomething that happened to [him] in \u201893\"\n(i.e., the illegal marijuana possession offense) (see Tr. 145). It is more likely that\nApplicant, fearing that his disclosure of recent drug use could cost him his clearance,\nput his personal desire to keep his job ahead of his fiduciary obligation to the\ngovernment. The government must be able to fully rely on the representations of those\npersons granted access to classified information, and Applicant has created\nconsiderable doubts about his trustworthiness. While his work record is commendable,\nit is insufficient to overcome the concerns generated by his lack of candor.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Applicant is 49 years of age and has a Ph.D in Nuclear Engineering. He is employed as a Research Scientist for a defense contractor. He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nOctober 28, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on August 6, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On March 30, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines C and B for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on April 15, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on May 12, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 2, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for June 24, 2009.  Applicant requested a continuance in order\nto travel to Taiwan with his family.  The matter was rescheduled on July 13, 2009, and\n\n2\nset for August 19, 2009.  In order to better accommodate the schedule, the matter was\nchanged to August 20, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented four exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4.  The Applicant presented no exhibits,\nhowever, he testified on his own behalf, as did his wife.  The record remained open until\nclose of business on September 3, 2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to\nsubmit additional supporting documentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing\nExhibit, consisting of five character reference letters, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit A, which was admitted without objection.  The official transcript (Tr.)\nwas received on August 28, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nREQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICE\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political condition in Taiwan.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. pp. 18-27).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted\ninto evidence, but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set\nout in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 49 years of age and has a Ph.D in Nuclear\nEngineering.  He is employed as a Research Scientist for a defense contractor.  He\nseeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a\nway as to show a preference for another country over the United States.\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 15, 2009, the Applicant admitted all of the\nfactual allegations.  He also provided additional information to support his request for\neligibility for a security clearance.  \nThe Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1960.  He was raised in and completed his\nmandatory military service in Taiwan.  He obtained his bachelors degree in nuclear\nengineering at a public university in Taiwan.  In 1985, he emigrated to the United States\nfor purposes of pursuing graduate school.  At school, he met his wife, and became a\nnaturalized United States citizen in 1995.  His wife is a native born American citizen,\nand they now have three children all born in the United States.  The Applicant\nparticipates in the political system in the United States and follows its laws.  \nThe Applicant considers himself an American citizen.  (Tr. p. 36).  He has chosen\nto maintain his dual citizenship with Taiwan because of his family back in Taiwan.  (Tr.\n\n3\np. 37).  On July 6, 2000, he applied for and was issued a Taiwanese passport.  His\nTaiwanese passport will not expire until July 6, 2010.  He continues to use his\nTaiwanese passport instead of his United States passport to enter and exit Taiwan,\nwhen he visits the country because of its convenience.  He is not willing to destroy or\nsurrender his Taiwanese passport.  (Tr. p. 38).  It would upset his father if he were to\ngive up his dual citizenship with Taiwan, and he does not want to upset his father.  (Tr.\np. 38).    \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant\u2019s father, step-mother, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizens\nand residents of Taiwan.  The Applicant\u2019s father is a retired career military police officer\nwith the Taiwanese Army.  The Applicant\u2019s biological mother resides in the United\nStates.  The Applicant has a close and continuing relationship with his father and step-\nmother in Taiwan.  The Applicant communicates with his in-laws in Taiwan about once a\nmonth or so.       \nIn the past ten years, the Applicant has traveled to Taiwan on at least four\nseparate occasions to visit his elderly parents.  They have increasing health issues and\nare not free to travel to the United States.  His most recent trip to Taiwan occurred in\n2009.  In 2008, he traveled to China for two weeks to attend his great uncle\u2019s funeral.\nHe and his sister are in-line to inherit his father\u2019s home in Taiwan.  He has never been\napproached by any governmental authority seeking to obtain information from him, and\nhe would never jeopardize the safety of the United States or compromise classified\ninformation.   \nThe Applicant\u2019s only financial resources are in the United States.  He owns a\nhome worth approximately $700,000.00, and has several retirement accounts worth\n$70,000.00 and $40,000.000 respectively.  His wife testified that he has also invested\nabout $145,000.00 in life insurance policies that will provide college funds for his\nchildren.  (Tr. p. 62).  \nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Taiwan.\nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy that has significant economic contacts with China.  It\nhas developed a strong economy since its separation from the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (PRC) in 1949.  The military\u2019s primary mission is the defense of Taiwan against\nthe PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat and which had not renounced the use\nof force against Taiwan.  Taiwan is known to be an active collector of U.S. economic\nintelligence and proprietary information.  Their activities have included the illegal export,\nor attempted illegal export, of United States protected technology. \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor, program manager,\ncoworker, and pastor all attest to the fact that the Applicant has demonstrated\n\n4\nunwavering loyalty to the United States.  He is described as a man of integrity, and\nresponsibility, who takes his work very seriously and has great pride in developing\ntechnologies that help to protect our country and our soldiers abroad.  He is highly\nrecommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).    \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Preference\n9.  The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for\na foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n10.  (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This\nincludes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\n\n5\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\n\n6\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Administrative Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as\nemphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination\nunder this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference),\nand Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown\nbetween Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified\ninformation, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign\nconnections, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to\nthe interests of the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises\nlegitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the\ninterests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government\nmust be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Preference, Disqualifying Condition 10(a) exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1)\npossession of a current foreign passport applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are\napplicable.\n\n7\nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States and continues to\nexercise his rights and privileges as such.  After becoming a United States citizen in\n1995, he applied for, obtained, and still possesses a valid Taiwanese passport that he\nregularly uses to enter and exit Taiwan during his visits.  He has no intentions of\nrelinquishing this foreign passport.  Although he could use his United States passport,\nhe chooses to use his Taiwanese passport for convenience purposes.  The possession\nof a valid foreign passport is disqualifying and under the circumstances of this case, I\nfind against the Applicant under Guideline C (Foreign Preference). \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  None of\nthe mitigating conditions apply. \nThe Applicant has a number of family members, including his father, step-\nmother, and in-laws, who are citizens of and reside in Taiwan, with whom he maintains\na close and continuing relationship.  He is so close to his father in Taiwan, a retired\nTaiwanese military officer, that he does not want to upset him by relinquishing his\nTaiwanese passport or renouncing his dual citizenship with Taiwan.  Although there is\nno evidence that any of his family members in Taiwan continue to be associated in any\nway with the Taiwanese government, the evidence is clear that the Applicant has a\nclose family bond.  This strong evidence of affection with his immediate family in Taiwan\ncould potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Moreover, the current political\nsituation in Taiwan elevates the cause for concern in this case.  The possibility of\nforeign influence exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the\ncompromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is vulnerable to foreign\ninfluence.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guidelines B and C of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under\nGuidelines B and C.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.:  Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.b.:  Against the Applicant\n\n8\nSubpara.\n1.c.:  Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.d.:  Against the Applicant\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n2.a.:  Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n2.b.:  Against the Applicant\n \nSubpara.\n2.c.:  Against the Applicant\n \nSubpara.\n2.d.:  Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n2.e.:  Against the Applicant\n \nSubpara.\n2.f.:   Against the Applicant\n \nSubpara.\n2.g.:  Against the Applicant\n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

In the last \nthree years she settled and paid 15 SOR and non-SOR collection debts totaling \n$22,186. She has a reasonable plan for resolving her remaining debts. Applicant had \nseven alcohol-related driving arrests from 1992 to July 2006. She stopped consuming \nalcohol in August 2006, except for consuming beer on one occasion in March 2007. She \nactively participates in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Security concerns are mitigated and \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 20, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86). (GE 1) On \nOctober 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR \nto Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \nMay 12, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) \nand F (financial considerations). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 3) The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 3) \n \nOn November 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a \nhearing. (HE 4) On January 12, 2010, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to \nproceed on Applicant\u2019s case. On January 22, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to \nme. On February 11, 2010, and February 26, 2010, DOHA issued hearing notices.1 (HE \n1, 2) On March 10, 2010, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held using video teleconference. \n(Transcript (Tr. 4; HE 1, 2) At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE \n1-6) (Tr. 28-32), and Applicant offered 18 exhibits. (Tr. 56-64; AE A-R) There were no \nobjections,2 and I admitted GE 1-6 and AE A-R. (Tr. 32, 64) Additionally, I admitted the \nhearing notices, SOR, and Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR. (HE 1-4) On March 16, \n2010, I received the transcript. On April 30, 2010, I received AE S. Department Counsel \ndid not object to my consideration of AE S, and AE S is admitted into evidence. \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.l, except \nfor 1.i as well as the debts in 2.a to 2.e and 2.g to 2.o.4 She said the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.c \n($792) duplicated the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.h ($792), and the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.d ($1,154) \nduplicated the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.e ($1,154). She denied the remainder of the debts. Her \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor.5 (Tr. 6) The \ngovernment contractor has employed her as a senior manufacturing engineer for 41 \nmonths. (Tr. 66) She was married from 1998 to 2001 and from 2003 to 2005. (Tr. 71) \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s former husbands consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, and their \nalcohol abuse contributed to Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse. (Tr. 72) They were abusive and \n \n1Applicant received notice of the date and time of her hearing from Department Counsel more \nthan 15 days prior to the hearing. However, she did not receive her written hearing notice form until \nFebruary 2, 2010. She waived the issue of 15 days\u2019 notice at her hearing. (Tr. 16-18) \n   \n2I granted Applicant\u2019s unopposed motion not to admit pages T-62 to T-66 of GE 4 because those \ndocuments did not pertain to Applicant.

She did not disclose any unpaid taxes or \nbankruptcies. She also disclosed seven arrests for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and \ntwo DWI convictions. She did not disclose any illegal drug use, or non-DWI criminal \noffenses.     \n \nAlcohol consumption \n \n \nIn 1991, Applicant began to consume alcohol regularly on most Friday evenings \nbeginning when she was 21 years old. (Tr. 75; HE 4; SOR \u00b6 1.a) In 1992, the police \narrested Applicant for her first DWI (Tr. 76-77; HE 4; SOR \u00b6 1.b) She received one year \nof probation, and the DWI charge was dismissed.

(Tr. 136) \nAfter her December 2003 DWI arrest, she received a year of unsupervised probation, \nher driver\u2019s license was suspended, and the court required her to complete a substance \nabuse traffic offender\u2019s program. (Tr. 82)  \n \nApplicant received her first alcohol treatment and therapy program in February \n2004. (Tr. 77-79, 83) This clinical intervention program consisted of 10 hours of one-on-\none, outpatient counseling, 20 hours of group therapy, and 20 hours of classroom \neducation. (Tr. 83) From February to July 27, 2004, she voluntarily enrolled in an \noutpatient treatment and detoxification program, and she refrained from any alcohol \nconsumption during this attendance. (Tr. 85-86; SOR \u00b6 1.h) However, a few days after \nleaving the program, she returned to alcohol consumption. (Tr. 87) On September 8, \n2004, she checked herself into a detoxification facility, and checked herself out that \nsame day because of an interaction she had at the facility with a man who previously \nconsumed alcohol with her. (Tr. 87-88, 133; SOR \u00b6 1.i) Her departure on September 8, \n2004, was against staff advice.

(Tr. 97) She received a fine and six months of probation. \nFrom August 1, 2006, to August 24, 2006, she received in-patient treatment for alcohol \ndependency.

(Tr. \n100) Instead, she drank six beers and this alcohol consumption confirmed to her that \nshe could not control her alcohol consumption or handle responsible drinking. (Tr. 100) \nShe has not consumed any alcohol since March 2007. (Tr. 98)  \n \nApplicant accepts that she is an alcoholic, and acknowledges she is alcohol \ndependent. (Tr. 100) She has continuously attended AA meetings since August 2007. \n(Tr. 98) She currently attends two to three meetings per week.

(Tr. \n138) Her AA sponsor of over three years corroborates Applicant\u2019s descriptions of her \nsobriety, AA participation, and volunteer work to help alcoholics. (AE J)  \n \nDepartment Counsel asked Applicant her future intentions concerning alcohol \nconsumption, and Applicant responded: \n \nMy future intention is to be absolutely abstinent. I have seen where \nalcohol will take me and I definitely don\u2019t have any plans to go back. I \nhave seen what wonderful things can happen from having a sober life. \nEven though I was functioning and holding a job at the time I quit drinking, \nyou know, I was also on good terms with my family. I wasn\u2019t enjoying my \nfamily or being able to participate in my niece and my nephew\u2019s lives. And \nnow I can.  .  .  . So I have learned that that life that I considered normal at \none time is not really what a normal life is. And so my intentions are to \nremain abstinent. (Tr. 103-104)       \n \n \n \n \n6The director\u2019s credentials included licensed alcohol and drug abuse counselor (LADAC), which I \ninfer is equivalent to licensed clinical social worker (LCSW).

(Tr. 72) Some of her \ndebts resulted from falling while she was drunk and being taken to the hospital in an \nambulance. (Tr. 105) SOR debts 1.a to 1.l, totaling $19,781, are all medical debts. Her \nmedical debts were generated in 2003 to 2004. (Tr. 106) The six debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g \n($1,713), 2.h ($792), 2.i ($311), 2.j ($299), 2.k ($212), and 2.l ($387) were all medical \ndebts being collected by the same company. On April 13, 2009, she sent a certified \nletter to the creditor asking for the status of her debts. (AE A at 1; AE O) She learned \nfrom the SOR-listed creditor that those six debts were returned to the two original \ncreditors. (Tr. 112-113) Applicant paid one of the original creditors, resolving the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.i and 2.j; however, she was unable to obtain the information on the other \nfour debts from the other original creditor.

(Tr. 107-108, 118; \nAE A at 1; AE M) She made three monthly payments of $297 into the program prior to \nher hearing. (Tr. 131)  \n  \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.m ($7,696) is for a delinquent credit card account. (Tr. 114) \nIn 2006, it was transferred to another lender.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 08-\n06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No. 08-07290 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, \n2009).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) and F (financial considerations).  \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) \nprovide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(b), 22(d), and 22(g) do not apply. Applicant did not consume alcohol at \nwork or have any alcohol-related incidents at work. Her alcohol consumption problem \nwas not diagnosed or evaluated \u201cby a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist).\u201d Applicant has not failed to comply with \na court order not to consume alcohol. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(e), and 22(f) apply. Applicant had seven DWI arrests from \n1992 to July 2006, and she had DWI convictions for her 2003 and July 2006 DWI \noffenses. Even though she was not convicted of five DWIs, I conclude she was in fact \nDWI on those occasions. In the first six months of 2006, she consumed up to 18 beers \nin a day, and her blood alcohol content for one of her DWIs was .25. This level of \nalcohol consumption constitutes \u201cbinge\u201d consumption. The director of a recognized \nalcohol-treatment program, whose credentials are equivalent to a LCSW, wrote a letter \nindicating Applicant was alcohol dependent. See n. 6 at page 2, supra. Applicant was \nproperly diagnosed as alcohol dependent in August 2006. After receiving alcohol \ntreatment in 2004, and 2006, and after being diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2006, \nshe consumed alcohol on one occasion in March 2007. Her alcohol consumption in \nMarch 2007 constitutes a relapse. She had a previous relapse in 2006 after alcohol-\nrelated treatment in 2004.   \n \n  \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has met its initial burden \nconcerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant \nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show \nmany different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a \nfairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.8  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) fully apply. Applicant had seven DWIs from 1992 to July \n2006. On August 24, 2006, Applicant was diagnosed as being alcohol dependent. She \nfully acknowledged and completely and candidly described her history of alcohol \nconsumption. She stopped her alcohol consumption in August 2006, and then relapsed \nor \u201cslipped\u201d in March 2007, when she drank six beers. She did not minimize her alcohol \nconsumption problem. Statements from colleagues, friends, her supervisor, and her AA \nsponsor about her abstaining from alcohol consumption after August 2006 provided \nvaluable corroboration of her statement. She successfully completed an alcohol \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd.

She continued her \nAA participation and has gone to hundreds of AA meetings over the last three years. \nShe has completely abstained from alcohol consumption since March 2007, and has \nonly consumed alcohol once (one day in March 2007) since August 2006.9 She has \ntaken all reasonable actions to ensure her continued successful rehabilitation, and \ntherefore she receives full mitigating credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d In \nISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her \ncredit reports, her security clearance application, her SOR response, and her statement \nat her hearing.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists 19 debts totaling $37,488. In the last three years she \nsettled and paid 15 SOR and non-SOR collection debts totaling $22,186. She settled \n \n9For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. \n05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a \nclearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most \nrecent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his \nalcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol consumption was \nnot responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three \nyears before hearing, and reversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nand paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f ($7,778), 2.i ($311), 2.j ($299), 2.m ($7,697), and 2.s \n($31). The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c ($1,154) and 2.d ($792) were duplications of the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e ($1,154) and 2.h ($792). On January 24, 2010, Applicant placed the five \ndebts totaling $16,213 listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a ($2,926), 2.b ($2,363), 2.c ($792), 2.d \n($1,154), and SOR \u00b6 2.o ($8,978) into her debt consolidation plan for resolution. She \nmade three monthly payments of $297 into the program prior to her hearing. Seven \ndebts totaling $3,314 remain for her to address more fully. Most of her SOR debts were \ndelinquent for over five years. The Government established the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions.   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant has provided sufficient evidence to rebut the validity of the three debts \ntotaling $473 listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.p ($217), 2.q ($62), and 2.r ($194). Although the three \ndebts appeared in her 2006 credit report, and did not appear in her January 12, 2009, or \nAugust 10, 2009, credit reports. She contacted one of the creditors, and they were \nunable to locate a record of the debt. She is still investigating the other two debts, and if \nshe can validate them, I am confident that she will pay them. \n \nFive debts are owed to the same medical creditor, and Applicant has contacted \nthe creditor to seek payment information for the debts totaling $2,312 listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.g ($1,713), 2.k ($212), and 2.l ($387). Applicant has not accrued any new delinquent \ndebts after 2005. She paid 10 non-SOR collection accounts since 2007, totaling $6,171.  \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s conduct warrants partial application of AG \u00b6 20(b). Her most recent \nmarriage ended in 2005. Her husband was abusive. Applicant and her husband \nconsumed excessive amounts of alcohol. Applicant was injured several times while she \nwas intoxicated, generating medical bills. She had absences from work due to migraine \nheadaches. She was unemployed from February to August 2004 and from December \n2004 to August 2005. She does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because her \nexcessive alcohol consumption contributed to the other problems in her life. \nNevertheless, starting in August 2006, she showed responsibility, self-discipline, and \ntenacity in maintaining contact with her creditors and making payments.10 By August \n2006, she was starting her new employment, had ended an abusive relationship with \nher spouse, and had ended her alcohol consumption. She acted aggressively and \nconscientiously to resolve her delinquent debts. She disclosed her delinquent debts and \nfinancial problems on her security clearance application. She established that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances after August 2006.    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) fully applies. Applicant received financial counseling. She created a \nreasonable plan to resolve her delinquent debts and followed through with it, \naccomplishing complete resolution of seven SOR debts (two duplications, five paid \ndebts) totaling $22,186. Five additional debts totaling $16,213 are in an established \npayment plan. Three debts totaling $2,312 are owed to the same medical creditor, and \nshe has contacted the creditor to seek payment information for these debts. Based on \nher track record of debt payment since 2007, I found her promise to resolve her \nremaining, unresolved debts to be credible.11 Three debts totaling $473 are not \nestablished. Applicant understands what she must do to maintain her financial \nresponsibility. Applicant\u2019s credit counselor cited the state statute of limitations of five \nyears in her post-hearing debt-payment advice. (AE S) Under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence, debts that are beyond the statute of limitations for collections cannot be \nmitigated solely because they are not collectable.12  \n \n10\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)) A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \n11 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not \na substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially \nresponsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n \n12The statute of limitations clearly and unequivocally ends an Applicant\u2019s legal responsibility to \npay the creditor after the passage of a certain amount of time, as specified in state law. In a series of \ndecisions the Appeal Board has rejected the statute of limitations for debts generated through contracts, \nwhich is the law in all 50 states, as automatically mitigating financial considerations concerns under AG \u00b6 \n20(d).

Applicant documented her dispute \nof the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.n ($529) by asking for the basis of the debt and not receiving a \nresponse from the creditor. Applicant admitted her responsibility for all of her debts. \nApplicant did not provide documentation showing she disputed any of her other SOR \ndebts.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant diligently and responsibly resolved or is attempting to resolve \nher delinquent SOR debts. Since August 2006, she has stopped consuming alcohol \n(except for one occasion in March 2007). She has made significant progress in paying \nher creditors. She received financial counseling and understands what she must do to \nshow her financial responsibility and maintain her eligibility for a security clearance. She \nprovided documentary proof of resolution of numerous debts. I am confident she will \nkeep her promise to pay her delinquent debts14 because of her track record of financial \nprogress shown over the last three years. Financial consideration concerns are \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n \n13The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)) \n \n14 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through \ncredit reports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar \nthe government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security \ncontext to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance.  An administrative judge does not have authority to grant a conditional \nclearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000). See also ISCR Case \nNo. 04-03907 at 2 (stating, \u201cThe Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary \nsecurity clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works on her \nfinancial problems.\u201d and citing ISCR Case No. 03-07418 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2004)). This footnote \ndoes not imply that this Applicant\u2019s clearance is conditional. \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c) I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nsignificant; however, they do not warrant revocation of her security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay or resolve her just debts in accordance with contracts she \nsigned was not prudent or responsible. She has a history of financial problems. Her \ncredit reports, security clearance application, and SOR response listed delinquent \ndebts. Her alcohol consumption is not a circumstance beyond her control and it \ncontributed to her financial woes. From 1992 to August 2006, Applicant engaged in a \npattern of alcohol abuse and dependence manifested by seven DWIs. She was \ncorrectly diagnosed as alcohol dependent in August 2006.  \n      \nThe rationale for granting or reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial. \nShe was forthright and candid in her security clearance application, her responses to \nDOHA interrogatories, her SOR response, and at her hearing about her financial and \nalcohol-related problems. Several problems partially beyond her control adversely \naffected her financial status. Her debts resulted from divorce, unemployment, her \nspouse\u2019s financial irresponsibility, and her medical problems. Of her 19 SOR debts \ntotaling $37,488, she completely resolved seven SOR debts (two duplications, five paid \ndebts) totaling $22,186. Five debts totaling $16,213 are in an established payment plan. \nShe is investigating three debts totaling $2,312. She credibly promised to resolve her \nremaining, unresolved debts to be credible. She understands what she must do to \nmaintain her financial responsibility. She paid 10 non-SOR collection accounts totaling \n$6,171. Her rent is current and she does not have any car loans or credit cards. I am \nconfident she will keep her promise to avoid future delinquent debt. The Appeal Board \nhas addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. She has achieved some important educational and \nemployment goals, demonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. She \nacknowledges that she is an alcoholic, and she ended her alcohol consumption in \nAugust 2006, except for consuming alcohol once in March 2007. She has attended \nhundreds of AA sessions, and volunteers at a clinic for alcoholics. Applicant received \nfinancial counseling and generated a budget. She is an intelligent person, and she \nunderstands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her financial responsibility. \nThere is simply no reason not to trust her. Moreover, she has established a \u201cmeaningful \ntrack record\u201d of debt re-payment.  \n \nApplicant has demonstrated her patriotism and trustworthiness through her \nservice to the Department of Defense as a contractor. Character witnesses described \nApplicant as professional, honest, and diligent. She is an asset to her employer.     \n \nI conclude Applicant has shown sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to \nmitigate the alcohol consumption and financial considerations security concerns. I take \nthis position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole-person factors,\u201d15 and supporting \nevidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and \nmy interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n15See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

In light of the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions are sustainable.\nB.  Department Counsel\u2019s cross-appeal:\nThe SOR contains three Guideline F allegations that describe acts of fraud by Applicant.  The\nfirst of the three alleges that, in 1995, she admitted to using another person\u2019s ATM card without the\nowner\u2019s authority.  The second alleges that in 1997 Applicant was charged with larceny of a personal\ncheck, larceny of Government funds, and larceny of private property, for which she was debarred\nfrom a military installation.  The third alleges that, in 1999, Applicant was arrested in a civilian\njurisdiction and charged with Financial Card Theft (felony) and Financial Card Fraud.  Applicant\npled guilty to the second count and the other was dismissed.  Concerning the first two of these\nallegations, the Judge stated that neither allegation \u201cgives any specific insight in this case.\u201d  Decision\nat 3.  Concerning the third, the Judge found that the Government had not provided any information\non this matter other than a report from the FBI describing the charges and the disposition.  In the\nAnalysis portion of the decision, the Judge did not explain why he apparently concluded that the\nthree allegations were not supported by substantial record evidence or otherwise did not set forth\nGuideline F security concerns.\nDepartment Counsel persuasively contends that the Judge erred.  As regards the first of the\nthree incidents, the 1995 ATM use, Applicant admitted to this allegation in her response to the SOR.\nAccordingly, the Government was under no obligation to present evidence concerning this matter.\nNevertheless, the Government did present a report by a military criminal investigation organization,\n\nGE 8, Criminal Investigation Report, dated October 12, 1995, at 12, 18.  \n1\nDirective \u00b6 E3.19(d): \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check\n2\nfraud . . . .and other intentional financial breaches of trust[.]\u201d  \nGE 9, Criminal Investigation Report, dated January 7, 1997.  \n3\nSubstantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n4\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nGE 10, FBI Identification Record, dated March 13, 2007.  \n5\n3\nin which Applicant admitted to having used the victim\u2019s ATM card.   This incident occurred on a\n1\nmilitary installation.  Applicant\u2019s admission to the military investigators is corroborated by\nstatements of other witnesses, including the victim, who advised that she did not give Applicant\npermission to use the card.  This allegation of fraudulent use of an ATM card, which Applicant has\nadmitted both in the report and in the response to the SOR, raises Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FCDC) 19(d).   The Judge\u2019s failure to identify this disqualifying condition,\n2\nand to analyze it in the context of Applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion as to mitigation, is error.\nRegarding the second fraud allegation, the 1997 larceny of a personal check, the Government\npresented a report, also by a military criminal investigation organization.   All incidents pertinent\n3\nto this allegation occurred on a military installation.  The report established that Applicant was\narrested in a stolen vehicle.  The vehicle contained a checkbook belonging to the victim, who had\nreported it stolen along with her wallet.  Someone had written several checks on the victim\u2019s bank\naccount without her permission.  The victim told the investigators that, after the theft, a female\ncontacted her saying that she would return the stolen wallet.  The victim and the female agreed to\nmeet at a location on base for the return of the property.  The victim did meet with a female on the\ndate in question, but she did not receive her wallet.  The victim and her husband, who was also\npresent, both independently identified Applicant in a photo lineup as the female they met in hopes\nof getting back the wallet. The report concluded that there was probable cause to believe Applicant\nstole the wallet and checkbook.  The U.S. Attorney declined to prosecute Applicant, though the\nmilitary commander debarred her from all of the service\u2019s installations in the state.  The Judge did\nnot explain why he concluded that this evidence does not shed light on Applicant\u2019s case, insofar as\nthe evidence tracks the SOR allegation in all of its particulars.  The Government has presented\nsubstantial evidence  of this allegation, raising FCDC 19(d), and the Judge\u2019s failure to treat it this\n4\nway is error.\nThe third allegation in question, the 1999 incident in which Applicant was convicted of\nFinancial Card Fraud, is supported by a report prepared by the FBI.   This report demonstrates that\n5\nApplicant was arrested for two apparently related offenses in July 1999.  She was tried in a state\nDistrict Court and was represented by a public defender.  She pled guilty to the lesser offense, a\nmisdemeanor, while the greater offense, a felony, was dropped.  Applicant was sentenced to 30 days\nconfinement, 12 months supervised probation, and a requirement to pay restitution.  Concerning this\nallegation, the Judge stated only that the Government presented no further evidence beyond that in\n\nSee Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), which holds that evidence of other wrongs may be admissible to prove\n6\nmotive, intent, knowledge, absence of mistake, etc.\nIn her Subject Personal Interview, contained in GE 4, Answers to Interrogatories, Applicant advised the\n7\ninterviewer that \u201cshe was never arrested, booked or processed while at the police department.  She was never summoned\nto court on this matter.\u201d  This is facially contradicted by GE 10.  Additionally, it appears to be inconsistent with\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, in which she does not deny that she was arrested and admits that she was charged\nand pled guilty, though she denied criminal intent.  Tr. at 48 - 52.  Additionally, Applicant made inconsistent statements\nconcerning the 1995 incident.  In GE 8, Applicant advised military investigators that she used the ATM card in order\nto assist a third person in recovering money which was purportedly owed to the third person by the victim.  However,\nat the hearing, she stated that she had used the ATM to purchase medication for the victim, who was ill.  Tr. at 44 - 46.\n4\nthe FBI report, which we construe as meaning that the Government had failed to meet its burden of\nproduction.  However, under the facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s conviction by a court of competent\njurisdiction, pursuant to a plea of guilty, of Financial Card Fraud is sufficient to meet the\nGovernment\u2019s burden.  Moreover, the Judge appears to have  treated this allegation in a somewhat\npiecemeal fashion, rather than in the context of the record as a whole.  For one thing, he did not\ndiscuss the fundamental similarities among the three allegations at issue in the cross-appeal, all of\nwhich involve theft of a financial instrument\u2013whether card or check\u2013giving Applicant access to\nanother person\u2019s bank account or line of credit.  These similarities warranted the Judge\u2019s discussion.\nAdditionally, the similarities are pertinent on the issue of Applicant\u2019s mens rea and undermine\nApplicant\u2019s denial of criminal intent.    Also, the Judge did not discuss Applicant\u2019s inconsistent or\n6\ncontradicted statements, which affect the credibility of her denials of intentional wrongdoing.7\nAgain, the Government has presented substantial evidence of this allegation, raising FCDC 19(d),\nand the Judge\u2019s cursory treatment of this allegation is error.\nIn light of the errors demonstrated by Department Counsel\u2019s cross-appeal, we might remand\nthe case to the Judge for a new decision in which he analyzes the extent to which Applicant met her\nburden of persuasion as to mitigation.  However, in light of the fact that the Judge denied Applicant\na security clearance based on her delinquent debts, a decision which is sustainable on the record\nbefore us, no purpose would be served by remand.  Therefore, we conclude that these errors are\nultimately harmless in that, even were they to be corrected, the outcome of the case would not\nchange.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

In light of the errors demonstrated by Department Counsel\u2019s cross-appeal, we might remand the case to the Judge for a new decision in which he analyzes the extent to which Applicant met her burden of persuasion as to mitigation. However, in light of the fact that the Judge denied Applicant a security clearance based on her delinquent debts, a decision which is sustainable on the record before us, no purpose would be served by remand. Therefore, we conclude that these errors are ultimately harmless in that, even were they to be corrected, the outcome of the case would not change.",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 21, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR), in writing on March 20, 2009, and\ninitially requested that a decision be made without a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. Thereafter a request was made to have a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on April 13, 2009. DOHA\ninitially issued a notice of hearing on April 23 2009, and the hearing was scheduled to\nbe heard on June 24, 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaii. Because of scheduling issues, the\nhearing was rescheduled, and a second notice of hearing was issued on May 14, 2009.\nThe hearing convened on July 21, 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaii. \n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 12, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and she submitted Exhibits A through\nC, which were entered into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr) was received\non August 7, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 38 years old. She is married, and she has three children. She is\nemployed by a defense contractor, but she is currently on leave from this employer. She\nseeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense\nsector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 10 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.j., and three\nallegations regarding criminal conduct, 1.k. through 1.m., under Adjudicative Guideline\nF. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the\nSOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $942. At the hearing,\nApplicant testified that she believed that she had paid this bill. She last talked to a\nrepresentative of this creditor in 2005, but she has taken no action since that time. At\nthis time, she does not know the status of this debt, but she indicted that she intends to\npay it (Tr at 27-31). I find that this debt has not been resolved. \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $128. Applicant\ntestified that she has not paid this debt. While she claimed she did not think that she\nincurred this debt, there was no evidence of Applicant filing any dispute (Tr at 31-32). I\nfind that this debt has not been resolved. \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $208 to the same\ncreditor as 1.b., above. Applicant testified that she has not paid this debt. I find that this\ndebt has not been resolved. \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,336. Applicant\ntestified that this debt for her husbands credit card has not been paid (Tr at 33). I find\nthat this debt has not been resolved. \n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $114.  Applicant\ntestified that she has paid this debt (Tr at 33). Exhibit A shows that this debt has been\npaid.\n\n3\n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $174. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has not been paid (Tr at 35-36). I find that this debt has not been\nresolved. \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $7,643. Applicant\ntestified that she plans to dispute this debt for housing. However, her dispute is with the\nArmy for not paying this debt. She did concede that this creditor is entitled to be paid (Tr\nat 36-39).  I find that this debt has not been resolved. \n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $56. Applicant\ntestified that she has paid this debt (Tr at 39-40). Exhibit B shows that this debt has\nbeen paid.\n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $357. Applicant\ntestified that she has paid this debt (Tr at 41-42). Applicant was unable to locate a\nreceipt that established that she has paid this debt. Exhibit C shows that she made one\npayment of $106.84, but it does not establish that it was for this debt, nor does it\nestablish that this debt has been resolved.\n1.j. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $390. Applicant\ntestified that she believes this debt was paid through an offset, but she is not sure and\nshe has not introduced evidence to substantiate that this debt was paid. (Tr at 52-43). I\ncannot find that this debt has been paid. \n1.k. The SOR alleges that in or about 1995, during a United States Marine Corps\n(USMC) criminal investigation, Applicant admitted to using an ATM card belonging to\nanother person, without authorization. Exhibit 8 consists of the records from the USMC\ncriminal investigation. Applicant was accused of theft from the bank account of another\nindividual. The records seem to indicate that Applicant withdrew $350 in total, on three\nseparate occasions, with the ATM card of a friend of hers that was given to her by\nsomeone else, and without the owner\u2019s authorization However, no conclusion is\nreached in Exhibit 8, and Applicant\u2019s testimony is limited, so I do not find that this\nallegation gives any specific insight in this case. \n1.l. The SOR alleges that in or about 1997, Applicant was charged in State A,\nwith (1) Forgery of a Personal Check, (2) Larceny of Government Funds, and (3)\nLarceny of Private Property. Applicant received a Letter of Debarment from all Army\ninstallations in State A, effective April 3, 1997. Applicant\u2019s explanation of this event is\nthat she was simply with someone else and was unaware of the checks until confronted\nby the Military Police. Exhibit 9, the records from an investigation into this matter by the\nDepartment of the Army, terminated the investigation without coming to a conclusion.\nExhibit 12 is a Letter of Debarment issued to Applicant on April 3, 1997. It states [the\nvictim] \u201cdeclined to prosecute the subject due to insufficient evidence to support a\nconviction.\u201d  I  do not find that this allegation gives any insight in this case. \n1.m. The SOR alleges that in or about 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith (1) Financial Card Theft, a felony, and  (2) Financial Card Fraud. Applicant plead\n\n4\nguilty to Count (2) and was sentenced to 30 days confinement, 12 months probation,\nand ordered to pay costs in the amount of $86 and restitution in the amount of $241.75.\nCount (1) was dismissed. Applicant denied that she ever served any time in\nconfinement as a result of this incident (Tr at 70). No other evidence was submitted\nregarding this allegation. \nApplicant testified that because of the pending security clearance hearing, she\nhas been suspended without pay from her current employment since March 9, 2009,\nand she has not sought any other employment since that time (Tr at 71). She attributed\nher financial difficulties to \u201cirresponsibility on my part\u201d (Tr at 97). Applicant averred that\nshe has stopped writing checks, with the exception of those to her daughter\u2019s school,\nbecause of the number of checks with insufficient funds that she has written, and which\nare part of the reason for her overdue debts. \nIn her responses to interrogatories, signed by Applicant on August 25, 2008, she\npromised to pay off most of her debts \u201dwithin the next 3-6 months.\u201d However, by the\ntime of the hearing, only two debts had been proven to be resolved, and those were in\nthe amounts of $114 and $56.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n5\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has been\nunable to pay most of her obligations for a considerable period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nUnder AG \u00b6 20 there are certain conditions that can be considered mitigating.\nHowever, since Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties and there was no\nevidence introduced to establish that Applicant has resolved most of these overdue\ndebts, I do not find that any mitigating condition is applicable to minimize the\nGovernment\u2019s concern with Applicant\u2019s financial situation.  I resolve Guideline F against\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\n\n6\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline F, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on\nall of the reasons cited above regarding Applicant\u2019s history of overdue debts, and her\nfailure to resolve the majority of her debts, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nsignificant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -.d, f, g, i,  j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e,  h, k, l, m:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 21, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n  \nApplicant submitted Answers to the SOR on December 12, 2008, and February 4, \n2009, and requested a decision without a hearing before. Department Counsel submitted \nthe Government\u2019s written case (FORM) to the Applicant on March 2, 2009. The Applicant \nreceived the FORM on March 12, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional \n \n \n1 \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \ninformation. No additional information was received from the Applicant and I received the \ncase assignment on May 15, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and \nexhibits eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe Applicant is 60 and single. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to \nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR. Those admissions are hereby \ndeemed findings of fact. \n \n1.a. \nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to his state tax authority in the \namount of $1,689.00 for a tax lien filed in January 2008. \n \n1.b. \nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) in the amount of $1,718.00 for a tax lien filed in August 1996. \n \n1.c. \nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to the IRS in the amount of \n$19,548.00 for a tax lien filed in January 1996. \n \n1.d. \n  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $500.00 \nfor a tax lien filed in December 1995. \n \n1.e. \nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to his state tax authority in the \namount of $6,872.00 for a tax lien filed in August 1993. \n \n1.f. \nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to the IRS in the amount of \n$21,107.00 for a tax lien filed in May 1993. \n \nThere is no evidence that these liens have been released or that any of these \namounts have been paid. In his Answer of February 4, 2009, at page 3, the Applicant \nstates, \u201cProcess has been established to begin with a payment plan for both parties Federal \ntaxes and state taxes.\u201d  The Applicant states in his Financial Interrogatory that \napproximately $175.00 per month would be paid towards this debt. (Item 7 at 2.) \n \n1.g. \nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency for a medical \nbill in the amount of $422.00.   \n \n1.h. \nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to the same collection agency for a \nsecond medical bill in the amount of $279.00.   \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nThe Applicant states in his Answer of February 4, 2009, that he has made \narrangements with the collection agency to begin payments on these debts.  He states that \n$40.00 a month will be automatically withdrawn from his checking account beginning in \nFebruary 2009. (Item 7 at 4.) \n \n1.i. \nThe Applicant admits that he owed a collection agency for an account in the \namount of $152.00. In his Answer of February 4, 2009, the Applicant states that this debt \nwas paid on December 15, 2008. (Item 7 at 5.)  \n \n1.j. \nThe Applicant admits that he owed a collection agency for an account in the \namount of $539.00.

However, \nin both of his Answers, the Applicant states that he has been unable to obtain any \ninformation from the creditor about the account, including whether it is his and the amount \nowed. (Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at 7.) Accordingly, this subparagraph is found for the Applicant.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG).

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Security clearance decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order \n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b618:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended  is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG \n\u00b619(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly \nunder AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security \nconcerns. The Applicant has over $52,000.00 in past due debts, including a large Federal \ntax debt, which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b620(a), the disqualifying condition may \n\n \n \n5 \n \nbe mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The most recent tax lien \nwas filed in January 2008, in the very recent past.  In addition, the Applicant submitted no \ninformation which explains how he got into this financial situation or how he proposes to get \nout of it.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.    \n \nThe Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off some of his creditors.  \nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is arguably applicable.  However, given the fact that he is over \n$50,000.00 in debt and has paid less than $1,000.00, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 \n20(c). \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of \nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; \nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole \nperson concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant obviously has made poor \ndecisions concerning his debts.  It appears that he has just now begun to resolve his debt \nsituation. \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all the Applicant\u2019s debts are paid - it is \nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance.  Given the Applicant\u2019s complete failure to begin to resolve these debts until just \nrecently, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \n\u00b62(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I cannot find that there is little to no potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)); or that the likelihood of recurrence \nis close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)).  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts or both as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.   \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the \nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the \nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary \nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b.: \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.: \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d.: \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e.: \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f.:  \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g.: \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h.: \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i.:  \nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j.:  \nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1k.:  \nFor the Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He submitted an e-QIP\nAttachment on August 6, 2005 (Government Exhibit 1).  Finally, he submitted a\nQuestionnaire for Sensitive Positions on January 15, 2008 (Government Exhibit 3).  On\nOctober 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines J, G and\nH concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005,\nand effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on November 6, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to\n\nThe SOR as written had four allegations under Paragraph 1.  After the presentation of evidence, the\n1\nGovernment moved to strike subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR to comport with the evidence presented.  The\nsubparagraph was so struck and the remaining three subparagraphs were renamed.  The SOR no longer has\na subparagraph 1.d.  (Transcript at 45-48.)\n2\nproceed on December 3, 2008.  The case was assigned to another Administrative\nJudge on December 4, 2008.  I received the case assignment on December 19, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 8, 2009.  I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on February 4, 2009.  The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D, without objection.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing on February 11, 2009.  The record closed on that date.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 28, single and has an Associate of Arts degree.  He is employed\nby a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe Government alleges under Guideline J that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.  The Government further alleges\nunder Guideline G that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he uses\nintoxicants to excess.  The Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR.\nThose admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  \n1\nThe Applicant has had three alcohol related incidents - in 1999, 2002 and 2006.\nThe Applicant was arrested in July 1999 for Purchase/Consumption of Alcohol While\nUnder 21.  He received a fine for this incident and one year probation.  (Transcript at\n40-41.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s second alcohol related incident happened in June 2002.  On that\noccasion, the Applicant was drinking and riding his motorcycle.  He fell off of the\nmotorcycle and was injured.  He was driving himself to the hospital when he was pulled\nover by the police and arrested for Reckless Driving and Driving With Blood Alcohol\nContent (BAC) Over .08%.  He plead guilty to the Reckless Driving charge and was\nfined and sentenced to three years probation.  (Government Exhibit 1; Transcript at 41-\n43.)\nThe Applicant testified that he drank the most during the years 2003-2004.  He\ndid not drink and drive during this period, but would have parties at the house he shared\nwith his sister.  (Transcript at 43-44.)\n\n3\nThe Applicant\u2019s third alcohol related incident occurred in January 2006.  He\noffered no excuse for his poor judgment in drinking too much and getting behind the\nwheel.  He was in an automobile accident and subsequently arrested for Driving Under\nthe Influence of Alcohol, Driving With BAC Over .08% and Resisting Arrest.  He plead\nguilty to the Driving With BAC Over .08% charge and received a fine, four days in jail\nand was placed on five years summary probation.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6;\nTranscript at 44-45, 48-49, 56-57.)\nThe Applicant states that this last incident changed his life.   Because of the 2006\narrest, he was released from a responsible job with the Federal Government during the\nprobationary period.  He still drinks, but always has a sober ride and never drives after\ndrinking alcohol.  He has been a sober ride for others.  He lost his driver\u2019s license for a\nyear after the last conviction, and found out a lot about himself while having to take\npublic transportation to work and depending on other people in order to see his young\nson.  He is determined to learn from these incidents and not engage in such conduct\nagain. (Transcript at 29-32, 52-54, 57-59.)  \nGuideline H - (Drug Involvement)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has used illegal drugs in the past.\nThe Applicant admitted that he used amphetamines occasionally for about a year\nbetween December 1999 and January 2001.  He used marijuana on an occasional\nbasis from 1997 until 2003.  At the beginning he used drugs because of the rush, but he\neventually grew to dislike them and stopped once he began a career in security that\nprecluded illegal drug use.  He regrets the use and wishes he had never done them.\nThe Applicant states he has disassociated himself from the people he used drugs with\nin the past.  Furthermore, the Applicant submitted a statement giving his permission to\nbe randomly drug tested and stating, \u201cI understand that if at any time I test positive, my\nsecurity clearance will be revoked.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D; Transcript at 32-38.)\nMitigation\nA person who is both a work associate and friend submitted a letter stating that\nthe Applicant is a person of integrity and moral character.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  The\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor submitted a letter stating that the Applicant is \u201can honest,\ntrustworthy, dedicated, and hard working individual.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)\nThe Applicant lives with his mother.  She submitted a statement stating that she\nhas strict rules against drunkenness and drug use in her home, and the Applicant obeys\nthem.  She also confirmed that he is careful about drinking and driving and arranges for\nalternate transportation in advance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\n\n4\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG \u00b6 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Applicant was involved in three alcohol related incidents: 1999, 2002 and\n2006.  The Applicant intends to consume alcohol in the future, but in a responsible\nmanner and never drink and drive again.\nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline, the following Disqualifying Conditions are\napplicable.  AG \u00b6 31.(a) \u201cA single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n31.(d) \u201cIndividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that the following Mitigating\nConditions also apply to this case.  Under AG \u00b6 32.(a), \u201cSo much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 32.(d) states, \u201cThere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nThere is one Disqualifying Condition concerning Alcohol Consumption that\napplies to this case.  AG \u00b6 22.(a) \u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \n\n6\nUnder the particular facts of this case, the following mitigating condition clearly\napplies to the Applicant\u2019s situation. AG \u00b6 23.(a) states that it can be a mitigating\ncondition when, \u201cSo much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d\nThe Applicant has had three alcohol related incidents in the past ten years.  Two\nincidents involved drinking and driving.  While that is certainly nothing to be taken lightly,\nthere is no evidence of a pattern of abuse here.  His last incident occurred three years\nbefore the record closed.  All the available evidence shows that the Applicant, having\nmatured since his first arrest, has taken positive steps to avoid alcohol problems in the\nfuture.  I have considered the fact that he is still on probation, as well as pertinent\ncharacter changes, such as his being a sober ride for other people.  The evidence is\nclear that the drinking and driving offenses are events of his past, and will not be\nrepeated.  The Applicant has mitigated the security significance of these incidents.  \nGuideline H - (Drug Involvement)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG \u00b624:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability or trustworthiness, both because\nit may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant, when he was a young man, used marijuana and amphetamine for\nseveral years.  The amphetamine use stopped in 2001 and the marijuana use in 2003.\nHe has credibly and repeatedly expressed his determination not to use illegal drugs in\nthe future.\nOne Disqualifying Condition has application in this case.  \u00b6 25.(a) \u201cAny drug\nabuse.\u201d\nI have considered all the evidence in the record and find that two Mitigating\nConditions also have application, and justify a finding for the Applicant on this allegation.\n\u00b6 26(a) \u201cThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \u00b6 26.(b) \u201cA demonstrated intent\nnot to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, young man who has had three alcohol related incidents in the last ten years.\nThere is little to no evidence that these incidents show a pattern, or that he is alcohol\ndependent or an alcohol abuser.  I have also considered his minor drug use, which he\nconvincingly describes as being the actions of an immature person, and that he is no\nlonger that person.  In viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has\nmitigated the security significance of his prior conduct.  As set forth at length above, I\nfind that the that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6);\nand that the likelihood of continuation or recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol\nrelated incidents, the related criminal conduct and his drug use.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor the Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline I \n(Psychological Conditions). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJune 26, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about January 22, 2009, and waived his right \nto a hearing before an administrative judge. On February 4, 2009, Department Counsel \nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing 16 Items, and mailed Applicant \na complete copy the following day. Applicant received the FORM on February 17, 2009, \nand had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional information. \nApplicant timely submitted additional information to which Department Counsel had no \nobjections. On May 28, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me.

He denied all other allegations, including those \ncontained in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n  \n \nApplicant is 42 years old and divorced. He has two children for whom he pays \nchild support. He was in the Army Reserves from I985 to 1995 and honorably \ndischarged as an E-5. In February 2007, he began his current position as an installation \ntechnical specialist for a federal contractor. Prior to this job, he has worked for private \ncompanies over the years. It is unclear in his e-QIP whether he was unemployed for a \nperiod of time within the past ten years. (Item 5) \n \n \nOn July 17, 2008, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories regarding 16 \nspecific delinquent debts. He asserted that he was attempting to establish a payment \nplan with some of the creditors. He noted that other creditors were not listed on his \ncredit report. He submitted a budget, listing his net monthly income as $4,435 and \nexpenses as $2,977, which included $871 in child support. He also listed a monthly \npayment of $436 for debt reduction. (Item 7)  \n \n \nOn December 12, 2008, the Government filed an SOR, alleging 22 delinquent \ndebts that totaled about $30,800, and included a student loan in default and unpaid \nchild support. According to credit bureau reports (CBR) dated January 2008 and \nNovember 2008, his delinquent debts began accruing in 2006. (Items 12 and 13) On \nMay 1, 2009, Applicant entered into a Consumer Credit Counseling Service contract in \nwhich he agreed to pay $353 per month on 11 delinquent debts, totaling $9,581. Some \nof the SOR debts are included in the contract that was scheduled to begin on May 25, \n2009, with his first payment. (AE 1 at 3-6) He did not submit proof that he made the first \npayment on the plan. The status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant asserted that he paid or is paying four debts: \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1. j lists Applicant\u2019s student loan delinquent as of December 2007 in \nthe amount of $14,409.  As of April 2009, the balance was $16,949. Applicant \nagreed to pay $50 per month to rehabilitate the loan and remove it from \ndefault status. He did not provide evidence that he has made those payments \nand that it is no longer in default. (AE 1 at 11-12) It remains unresolved. \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.v alleges that Applicant owes $3,154 in child support arrearage \nsince December 2007. According to a court order entered on April 6, 2009, \nhis monthly payment of $821 increased to $871 to cover $6,556 of arrears. \nThe court also ordered him to pay $1,000 toward the arrears, with a $500 \npayment on May 15, 2009 and June 15, 2009. (AE 1 at 7-8) Applicant \npreviously noted the $871 child support payment in his July 2008 budget, but \ndid not provide proof that he has been timely making payments over the last \nseveral months, or that he made the additional $500 payment on May 15, \n2009. It remains unresolved. \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.n for $85 is owed a creditor. Applicant stated he is paying the debt, \nbut did not submit any proof of payments. (AE 1 at 2) It remains unresolved. \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.u for $69 is owed to a creditor. He claims he is paying it, but did not \nsubmit any proof of payment on this debt. (AE 1 at 2) \n \n \nThe monthly repayment plan was scheduled to be implemented on May 25, \n2009, and includes ten debts (AE 1 at 2): \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e for $439 is owed to a utility company. The plan includes a $16 \ndisbursement to this creditor.  \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f for $510 is owed to a utility company. It appears to be the same \ndebt as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e.  (Item 12) \n \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g for $567 is owed to a cell phone company. The plan includes a \n$20 monthly payment.  \n \n8. SOR \u00b6 1.h for $535 is owed to a credit card company. The plan includes a \n$20 monthly payment. \n \n9. SOR \u00b6 1.i for $566 is owed to the same credit card company as in SOR \u00b6 1.h.  \n \n10.  SOR \u00b6 1.l for $121 is owed to a jewelry company. The plan includes a $20 \nmonthly payment.  \n \n11.  SOR \u00b6 1.o for $314 is owed to a utility company. The plan includes a $15 \nmonthly payment. It was settled for $186. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n12.  SOR \u00b6 1.p is a $3,293 debt owed on a car loan. The plan includes a $127 \nmonthly payment.  \n \n13.  SOR \u00b6 1.r for $1,671 is a medical debt that was transferred to a new \ncollection agency. The plan includes a $51 monthly payment. \n \n14. SOR \u00b6 1.s is a $717 medical debt. The plan includes a $22 monthly payment. \n \nEight of the delinquent debts remain unresolved. Some of them are medical bills \nthat he did not pay because he did not have insurance at the time he incurred them:  \n \n15. SOR \u00b6 1.a for $2,372 is a medical bill.  \n \n16.  SOR \u00b6 1.b for $74 is a returned check fee. \n \n17. SOR \u00b6 1.c for $107 is a medical debt.  \n \n18. SOR \u00b6 1.d for $297 is owed to a creditor. Applicant denied the debt and \nasserted that it no longer is in collections. He did not present any evidence \nthat he has disputed it.   \n \n19.  SOR \u00b6 1.k for $519 is owed to a credit card company. He asserted that it is \nincluded in the repayment plan, but did not provide proof of its inclusion. \n \n20.  SOR \u00b6 1.m for $440 is a medical debt.  \n \n21.  SOR \u00b6 1.q for $266 is a medical debt. \n \n22.  SOR \u00b6 1.t for $275 is owed to a credit card company. He denies the debt, but \ndid not produce any evidence that he has disputed it.  \n \n \n \n   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.x alleges that Applicant was scheduled to appear in court on four counts \nof misdemeanor Simple Worthless Checks on December 10, 2008. In his Answer, \nApplicant stated that the case was dismissed. He provided proof that he has made \nseveral payments to his lawyer, but not a court order documenting that the matter was \ndismissed. (AE 1) \n \n \n   \n \nApplicant has received psychiatric treatment since approximately June 2002. \nAccording to a December 1, 2008 progress note by his psychiatrist, Applicant was not \nparticipating in counseling class and \u201cis in need of continued Mental Health Services to \nmaintain stabilization, prevent further deterioration and/or relapses.\u201d (Item 6) The \nprogress note further indicated that Applicant was not taking his medication. (Id.) In his \nAnswer, which DOHA received on or about January 22, 2009, Applicant denied that he \nwas not participating in counseling classes and noted that he had an appointment with \nhis psychiatrist on January 20, 2009. He did not submit proof of compliance with the \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nrecommended psychiatric treatment in his Answer or in the documents he submitted \nafter receiving the FORM.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to this guideline are set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating significant delinquent debt in 2006 that he has \nbeen unable or unwilling to pay or resolve until very recently. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concern. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply because Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing since \n2006, involve numerous creditors and do cast doubt on his current reliability and good \njudgment.  \nApplicant did not document evidence of circumstances that may have been \nbeyond his control and contributed to his financial problems, Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) does \nnot apply. He presented evidence that on May 1, 2009, he entered into a debt \nrepayment plan through a credit counseling company to address ten debts, which \nwarrants a limited application of AG \u00b6 20(c). He asserted that he has made a good-faith \neffort to pay four debts, including his child support and student loans, but did not submit \nproof of payment on those debts. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. Although he \ndenies several debts, he did not provide written documentation that he has disputed \nthem, which is necessary to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(e). There is no evidence \nto support the application of AG \u00b6 20(f). \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 expresses the security concern pertaining to psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for \nthere to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted when \nevaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this \nguideline. No negative inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may \nbe raised solely on the basis of seeking mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a \ndiagnosed emotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g., failure to take \nprescribed medication. \nBased on the evidence in the record, Applicant has failed to follow the treatment \nrecommended by his psychiatrist. The Government raised the above disqualification. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate the security concern raised under \nthis guideline: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., one \ncaused by death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been \nresolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of emotional \ninstability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \nAfter reviewing the evidence in this file, I find that none of the above mitigation \nconditions applies to this case. Applicant\u2019s depression is \u201creadily controllable with \ntreatment,\u201d however; he failed to demonstrate that he has been consistently complying \nwith his doctor\u2019s recommendation. Hence, AG \u00b6 29(a) cannot apply. There is no \nevidence that he is receiving counseling, that he has a favorable prognosis and that his \ndepression is under control, which evidence is required to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 \n29(b) or AG \u00b6 29(c). Applicant has been receiving treatment for depression since 2002, \nwhich indicates that the illness is not situational. AG \u00b6 29(d) is not applicable. AG \u00b6 \n29(e) cannot apply because there is an indication of a current problem based on his \ntreatment non-compliance. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 42-year-old man, who \nhonorably served this country for ten years. For the past two years, he has been \nworking for a federal contractor.  However, over the course of the last three years, he \nhas failed to demonstrate good judgment in managing his financial obligations and \nmaintaining medical compliance. His behavior raises questions about his judgment and \ndemonstrates a lack of reliability. For example, when the Government sent Applicant the \nJuly 2008 Interrogatories, which inquired into 16 specific debts, the Government placed \nhim on notice of its concerns about his financial delinquencies. When it issued the \nDecember 12, 2008 SOR, it again notified Applicant that his financial delinquencies \nwere creating security concerns and jeopardizing his employment. After he filed his \nAnswer, the Government issued the FORM, specifically noting his failure to produce \nsufficient documentation or affirmative action to address his debts. Despite these \nrepeated notifications, he waited until May 25, 2009, to implement a repayment plan. He \nasserted that he was paying some of his debts, and yet failed to document those \nassertions. He claimed he was in compliance with his doctor\u2019s treatment \nrecommendations, but did not corroborate his statements with documentation.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations and \npsychological conditions.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:     \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g through 1.v:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n   \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n10\n \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nSHARI DAM \n Administrative Judge \n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Stephanie N. Mendez, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant abused drugs and alcohol from 1998 to 2003, to the point of developing\ndependencies. After two Minor in Possession of Alcohol (MIP) and one Driving Under\nthe Influence (DUI) convictions, he entered three inpatient and one outpatient treatment\nprograms. The latter two of those were successful, and he has been clean and sober\nsince May 2003. He deliberately falsified and omitted relevant facts concerning this\nhistory at various stages of the security clearance process. Applicant mitigated drug and\nalcohol-related security concerns, but failed to mitigate resulting criminal and personal\nconduct security concerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, testimony,\nand exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on September 24,\n2007. On August 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under\nAugust 17, 2010\n\n2\nGuidelines E (Personal Conduct), G (Alcohol Consumption), H (Drug Involvement), and\nJ (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information that went into effect within the\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 17, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on September 2, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Applicant failed to respond to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and\n4.a in this response. On September 25, 2009, DOHA resubmitted the SOR to Applicant\nto correct this error. Applicant again answered the SOR in writing on October 14, 2009.\nThis answer (AR) was identical to his initial answer, but also admitted to SOR \u00b6 1.a. He\nagain failed to respond to SOR \u00b6 4.a, which essentially alleged the facts set forth in\nSOR \u00b6 1 by reference. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 16, 2009, and the\ncase was assigned to me on November 18, 2009. Appellant was performing assigned\nwork at a shipyard in another state until mid-February, so DOHA transferred the case to\na different administrative judge responsible for that area on December 17, 2009. That\nadministrative judge convened the hearing on January 28, 2010, and initially denied\nApplicant\u2019s motion for a continuance to obtain counsel and further prepare his case.\nAfter Department Counsel\u2019s opening statement, and before introduction of any\nevidence, Department Counsel withdrew his earlier objection to Applicant\u2019s motion for a\ncontinuance, and the judge granted the motion. DOHA received the transcript of this\nsession of the hearing on February 12, 2010, and reassigned the case to me on\nFebruary 18, 2010. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 25, 2010, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on April 9, 2010. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through\n8, which were admitted without objection. The Government also submitted Hearing\nExhibits (HE) II and III in support of a request for administrative notice of the contents of\nthe Controlled Substances Act. This request was not opposed, and was granted.\nApplicant offered exhibits (AE) A through L, which were also admitted without objection.\nHe and his wife testified on his behalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record\nopen until April 23, 2010, for submission of additional evidence. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 21, 2010. Applicant submitted AE M before the\nApril 23, 2010 deadline. Department Counsel also forwarded four pages of GE 7 that\nwere inadvertently omitted from the original exhibit. This evidence was admitted without\nobjection, and the record was closed. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a major defense contractor, where he has\nworked since 2007. He has no military service, and this is his first application for a\n\nGE 1.\n2\nAR; Tr. 12-19.\n3\nGE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6.\n4\nAR; GE 7 at I-99; Tr. 67, 90-97.\n5\nAR; GE 7; Tr. 101-103.\n6\nAR; GE 4.\n7\n3\nsecurity clearance. He is married with no children.  In his response to the SOR, he\n2\nformally admitted all of the factual allegations, although he did not respond to SOR \u00b6\n4.a, which incorporated the information set forth in SOR \u00b6 1 by reference. During the\nhearing, through counsel, he initially admitted SOR \u00b6 4.a, then changed his mind and\ndenied that his falsifications were deliberate and intentional.  Applicant\u2019s admissions,\n3\nincluding his statements in response to DOHA interrogatories,  are incorporated in the\n4\nfollowing findings.\nApplicant began using marijuana and alcohol when he was 15 years old. By age\n17, which he reached in November 2000, he was using marijuana daily and drinking\nabout ten beers a week, frequently to the point of intoxication. That year he also began\nregularly using cocaine, methamphetamine, and psilocybin mushrooms. He also\nexperimented \ntwice \nwith \nLSD, \nprescription \ncodeine, \nand \necstacy\n(methylenedioxymethamphetamine).  \n5\nDuring July 2001, Applicant was charged with his first MIP offense, for which he\nreceived probation and court-ordered alcohol treatment. He completed a one-month\ninpatient treatment program during September and October 2001. Following a probation\nviolation, he was ordered back into inpatient drug and alcohol treatment in December\n2001. He was expelled from that program after three days for bringing marijuana into\nthe facility. After that, he served some time in jail.    \n6\nDuring April 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI after being\nstopped for running a stop sign and testing two to three times over the legal limit. He\nsubsequently pled guilty and was ordered to pay a $2,500 fine, serve five years\nprobation, and undergo additional alcohol treatment. During August 2002, he was\narrested again for MIP, together with obstructing justice for giving the arresting officer a\nfalse name, and a minor theft charge. He pled guilty to these offenses, and was given a\nsuspended three-year jail sentence, fined $1,000, and ordered into alcohol treatment.7\nApplicant continued abusing alcohol, marijuana, and methamphetamine into\n2003. He entered and successfully completed another inpatient drug and alcohol\ntreatment program in a different city from May to July 2003. He then successfully\ncompleted an outpatient drug and alcohol treatment program from November 2003 to\nMay 2004. As reported during the intake evaluation for this latter program, Applicant\u2019s\nprimary drug of abuse was marijuana, and the secondary was alcohol. He used each of\n\nAR; GE 8 at 2, 12, Tr. 90-93, 97, 105-107. \n8\nGE 8 at 2-3; AE B; AE D; AE E; AE F; AE I; Tr. 50-51, 68-79, 88-90, 110-126. \n9\nAR; GE 5 at I-19; Tr. 16-19, 58-61, 66, 78-82, 136-137.\n10\nAR; Tr. 61-65, 78-79, 82-83.\n11\n4\nthese on a daily basis until May 16, 2003, when he entered his latest inpatient\ntreatment. His other drug of choice was methamphetamine, which he used three times a\nweek until April 20, 2003. He was diagnosed as dependent on all three substances.   \n8\nApplicant was discharged from his outpatient treatment with a prognosis from his\ncounselor that he was at low risk of relapse with continued attendance at Narcotics\nAnonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He has complied with this\nrecommendation, and remained clean and sober since May 2003. He has changed his\nlifestyle, and no longer associates with his former alcohol and drug abusing friends. He\nis married to a very impressive and supportive woman, with whom he has developed a\npattern of healthy living, remaining free of alcohol and drugs. He also submitted a\nstatement of intent to never abuse drugs in the future, agreeing to automatic revocation\nof his security clearance for any violation, and three recent urinalysis reports showing\nnegative results for all drugs tested.9\nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24 that\nasked whether he had illegally used any controlled substance since the age of 16 or in\nthe last seven years, whichever was shorter. Applicant turned 16 during November\n1999, and signed his SF 86 on September 24, 2007. He admitted that he deliberately\nfailed to list the information concerning his drug use detailed above, and set forth in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.h, in his response to the SOR. During his hearing, he changed\nhis position on this point, and claimed that he misunderstood the question. His\nexplanations  to that effect were not credible, and his demeanor during that testimony\nwas unconvincing. His subsequent efforts to conceal his drug involvement during\nquestioning about his alcohol-related offenses and court-ordered treatment programs\ncorroborated his intent to conceal that aspect of his substance abuse. I find that his\nfalse \u201cNo\u201d answer and omission of his history of drug use was a deliberate attempt to\ndeceive the Government concerning those matters. Applicant testified that he is a good\nreader, and understood his legal obligation to answer all questions fully and truthfully.  \n10\nIn his response to question 25, concerning whether he had undergone any\nalcohol-related treatment or counseling in the last seven years, Applicant said \u201cYes\u201d, but\nincorrectly stated that this treatment occurred at his last outpatient treatment center\nfrom January 2003 to January 2004. He admitted in his SOR response that he\ndeliberately omitted listing his three earlier inpatient treatment programs discussed\nabove. He said that he did not disclose the earlier treatment because he believed it was\nunder juvenile records and possibly was sealed. Nobody advised him not to disclose\nthis information, he just thought it would not be discovered.  \n11\n\nGE 4 at I-10.\n12\nAR; Tr. 65-66, 82-83.\n13\nAR; GE 4; Tr. 65-66, 83-85.\n14\nGE 4 at I-9, I-12.\n15\nAR; Tr. 99-100, 105-106.\n16\nGE 5 at I-15.\n17\n5\nDuring his November 2007 interview with an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM), Applicant disclosed that he had undergone, \u201cone month\nin inpatient alcohol treatment in late 2002,\u201d in the city where he underwent his last\ninpatient treatment from May to July 2003. He said he could not remember the name of\nthe facility. He also discussed the follow-on outpatient treatment. He told the\ninvestigator that he had not received any other alcohol treatment, nor had any other\ntreatment been recommended.  He admitted in his SOR response that he deliberately\n12\nfailed to disclose his earlier inpatient treatment following his 2001 MIP conviction,\nincluding his dismissal from the December 2001 treatment for using marijuana during\nthe program. He offered no satisfactory explanation for this failure to disclose this\ntreatment to the investigator.13\nApplicant also admitted in his SOR response that during his OPM interview he\ndeliberately failed to disclose that his 2001 inpatient programs included treatment for\ndiagnosed dependency to marijuana and abuse of various other drugs, and that his\noutpatient program from 2003 to 2004 included treatment for diagnosed dependency to\nmarijuana and methamphetamine as well as alcohol. Applicant offered no explanation\nfor this deception, except to claim that he was not directly asked about drugs, which\ncorroborates his ongoing effort to conceal his drug use from the Government.14\nDuring his OPM interview, Applicant claimed that his last drink of alcohol was\nduring August 2002, coinciding with his latest MIP arrest. When asked to verify the\naccuracy of this statement in response to DOHA interrogatories, he added \u201cI would like\nto note that I failed to mention a relapse of alcohol on 5/16/03. I initially quit drinking in\nAugust of 2002 but had a misstep in my recovery.\u201d  Applicant actually continued\n15\nregular alcohol use until he reached his \u201crock bottom\u201d in May 2003. He admitted in his\nresponse to the SOR that this failure to disclose the additional alcohol consumption\nduring the interview was deliberate.16\nIn his September 2008 response to DOHA interrogatories concerning drug use,\nApplicant claimed that had used marijuana one to three times a week between ages 16\nand 18, and used methamphetamine once every other week for about six to eight\nmonths while he was age 17. He claimed that his last drug use was on June 12, 2002.17\nHe turned 18 years old in November 2001. Intake documents obtained from his latest\noutpatient treatment program revealed that he used marijuana daily until May 16, 2003,\n\nGE 8 at 12.\n18\nAR; Tr. 98-99; 105-107.\n19\nGE 1 at 12.\n20\n6\nand used methamphetamine three times a week until April 20, 2003.  Applicant\n18\nconfirmed during the hearing that his drug use continued into 2003 as indicated in the\noutpatient treatment records, and provided no credible explanation for his false\nresponse to the interrogatory. In his SOR response, he admitted to deliberately\nfalsifying these facts and failing to disclose his continuing drug use for almost another\nyear after June 2002.19\nApplicant signed his SF 86 under the certification that he understood that a\nknowing and willful false statement on that form can be punished by fine or\nimprisonment or both, including a citation to \u201csection 1001 of title 18, United States\nCode.\u201d  That statute reads, in relevant part:\n20\n\u00a7 1001. Statements or entries generally. \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knowingly and willfully--\n(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or\ndevice a material fact;\n(2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or representation; or\n(3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the\nsame to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry;\nshall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the\noffense involves international or domestic terrorism (as defined in section\n2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both. If the matter relates to\nan offense under chapter 109A, 109B, 110, or 117, or section 1591 [18\nUSCS \u00a7\u00a7 2241 et seq., 2250, 2251 et seq., 2421 et seq., or 1591], then\nthe term of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be not more\nthan 8 years.\nApplicant submitted his performance evaluation for June 2008 to June 2009,\nreflecting satisfactory to exceptional results. He also provided the record of his\nextensive training and increasingly responsible job assignments. Numerous supervisors,\ncoworkers, friends, and family members wrote letters describing his good character,\n\nGE 5 at I-28-31; AE A; AE B; AE C; AE G; AE H; AE J; AE K; AE L; AE M.\n21\n7\nsuccessful rehabilitation from his earlier substance abuse problems, and outstanding\npotential. He presented himself in an impressive manner throughout his hearing.  \n21\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n8\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes the DCs under this guideline. The specific Guideline E\nconcerns raised by the SOR allegations are:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.  \nApplicant is an intelligent individual who communicates sufficiently well, orally\nand in writing, to have known he was deliberately falsifying, concealing, and failing to\ndisclose relevant facts concerning his drug and alcohol abuse and treatment on his SF\n86, during his OPM interview, and in his response to DOHA interrogatories. The clear\nweight of the evidence compels the conclusion that his falsifications and omissions of\nrelevant facts on his SF 86 and in response to interrogatories, was deliberate, raising\nAG \u00b6 16(a). The falsifications and omissions during Applicant\u2019s OPM interview, as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, were also clearly deliberate. These acts shift the\nburden to him to establish mitigation.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides personal conduct MCs. The only MCs with potential\napplicability to the foregoing security concerns are:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n\n9\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nMitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a) was not established because Applicant did not\ndisclose any of the information he was attempting to conceal until confronted with the\nfacts during subsequent steps in the investigation process. He offered no evidence that\nwould support application of AG \u00b6 17(b). No mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c) was\nestablished, since the falsifications were numerous, and took place in connection with\nthe present security clearance eligibility determination. AG \u00b6 17(d) was not established\nbecause he unpersuasively tried to retract his admissions to these deliberate\nfalsifications during his hearing. Applicant did not demonstrate positive steps to reduce\nor eliminate his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. His employer\nremains uninformed of the extent of his prior substance abuse, and his multiple\nattempts to conceal those facts demonstrate his understanding of their potential\nnegative impact on his reputation. AG \u00b6 17(e) was therefore not established.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The DCs supported by the SOR allegations and asserted by Department\nCounsel are:\n\n10\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program; and\n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion\nof an alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents in 2001 and 2002 included one DUI and two\nMIP incidents. He admitted consuming alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of\nintoxication, from approximately 2000 to at least May 2003. He was diagnosed as\nalcohol dependent during three inpatient and one outpatient alcohol treatment\nprograms, and admitted to multiple relapses after his 2001 diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence and completion of inpatient treatment in October of that year. These facts\nclearly raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (c), (e), and (f).\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security\nconcerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\n\n11\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident occurred almost eight years ago, and he\nhas not consumed any alcohol since May 2003 when he entered his last inpatient\ntreatment for his diagnosed alcohol and drug dependence. He has completely changed\nhis former lifestyle, married a woman who is highly supportive of his continuing\nabstinence, and demonstrated his ongoing intention to remain sober. His original\nrelapse behavior following his first court-ordered treatment program occurred before he\nrealized the extent of his problem and made a decision to stop abusing alcohol and\ndrugs. He continues to participate in NA and AA aftercare programs, and received a\nfavorable prognosis from his counselor following completion of his last outpatient\ntreatment in May 2004. Although his relapses between 2001 and 2003 preclude\napplication of AG \u00b6 23(c), Applicant met his burden to establish full mitigation of alcohol-\nrelated security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), (b), and (d).\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and\nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g.,\nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The DCs raised by the facts in this case are:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and\n\n12\n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical\nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment\nprogram.\nApplicant admitted to illegally abusing numerous drugs at age 17, as set forth in\nSOR \u00b6 2. He abused marijuana and methamphetamine until age 19, and to the extent\nthat he developed dependence on both of those drugs. This dependence was\ndiagnosed by the social workers serving as counselors in each of the three alcohol and\ndrug treatment programs that Applicant completed. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The MCs with\npotential application under the facts in this case are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation; and\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,\nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional.\nFor the same reasons discussed above concerning alcohol abuse, Applicant has\nmet his burden to establish mitigation under the foregoing three MCs. His drug abuse\ncompletely ceased more than seven years ago, when he decided to embrace treatment\nand change patterns of substance abuse that characterized his late teenage years. He\nrelocated to another city, disassociated from his drug-using former friends, and has\nestablished a clear pattern of abstinence after successful completion of inpatient and\noutpatient drug treatment programs from May 2003 to May 2004. He signed a statement\nof intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation, and was entirely\ncredible in testifying that he fully intends to remain clean and sober. His favorable\nprognosis was not from a \u201cduly qualified medical professional,\u201d but his counselor\u2019s June\n2004 statement that his risk of relapse was low with continued participation in AA/NA\nhas proven true. \n\n13\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The condition supported by this record is \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses.\u201d As alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.a, each of the falsifications and\nomissions of material facts set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f were knowing and willful,\nthereby constituting violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security\nconcerns. These are: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nFor the same reasons that Applicant failed to establish the parallel MCs under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), he failed to meet his burden with respect to these\nMCs. The multiple falsifications were recent, and his unpersuasive attempts to justify\nthem during the hearing demonstrate his lack of rehabilitation in this respect.     \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n14\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s drug and alcohol\nabuse occurred when he was young and irresponsible. He successfully completed\ntreatment for those addictions during 2003 and 2004, and has remained clean and\nsober since then. He established an excellent reputation for responsibility and good\ncharacter at work and among friends and family. His maturation and changed living\ncircumstances are commendable, and fully mitigate any ongoing security concerns\nbased on those earlier issues. \nHowever, failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process is of special concern. Applicant\u2019s untruthful statements throughout\nhis application and investigation demonstrated a lack of understanding or respect for the\nobligations inherent in the Personnel Security program. The criminal nature of these\ndecisions is of collateral concern. The primary issues are Applicant\u2019s lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and ongoing potential for coercion or\nduress demonstrated by his consistent attempts to conceal and minimize his past\nsubstance abuse. He did not adequately explain or otherwise mitigate his conduct in\nthis regard.\nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to mitigate\nthe security concerns arising from his personal conduct and criminal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.j:\nFor Applicant\n\n15\nParagraph 3, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her answer, Applicant admitted all of the ten allegations in the SOR concerning delinquent debts of approximately $28,000. Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has worked for the company and its predecessor since 1994. She has risen in responsibility and now is a lead project manager supervising ten people. She has held a security clearance since 1997 without any adverse incidents. Applicant is married with four children ages 21, 17, 14, and 13. Her oldest child is now on his own and is paying his own way. She has been the sole income provider for the family since 2000 when her husband left his job to stay at home to help with the children and the household. He still prefers not to work even though the children are no longer in need of his supervision or at-home care. It also was in 2000 that Applicant had the first of two spinal surgeries that caused her to be placed on medical leave reducing her income by 2/3s. She was out of work for over five months after that surgery. The second surgery was in 2001 and she was out of work for six weeks. Each surgery cost $40,000 to $50,000. Her insurance paid 90% of the cost but she was required to pay the balance. It was during the period of illness and unemployment that many of the debts were incurred. At the time Applicant submitted answers to interrogatories in August 2008, she had a negative monthly cash flow of $197. Several weeks ago, she received a promotion and pay increase of $2.50",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on July 30, 2007. On November 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nfor Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006.\nApril 16, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 8, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed,\nand I received the case assignment on January 30, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on February 3, 2009, for a hearing on February 19, 2008, and it was convened\nas scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered six exhibits (Exhs. 1-6) that were admitted\nin evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf but submitted no\ndocuments. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 26, 2009. At\nthe hearing, I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 20, 2009,\nto submit additional evidence. At the request of Applicant, the period was extended until\nMarch 27, 2009. A post-hearing submission was received within the specified time\ncontaining two documents (Exhs. A-1 and 2). The government had no objection to the\nsubmission and the documents were admitted in evidence without objection.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her answer, Applicant admitted all of the ten allegations in the SOR concerning\ndelinquent debts of approximately $28,000. Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a\ndefense contractor who has worked for the company and its predecessor since 1994.\nShe has risen in responsibility and now is a lead project manager supervising ten\npeople. She has held a security clearance since 1997 without any adverse incidents.\nApplicant is married with four children ages 21, 17, 14, and 13. Her oldest child is\nnow on his own and is paying his own way. She has been the sole income provider for\nthe family since 2000 when her husband left his job to stay at home to help with the\nchildren and the household. He still prefers not to work even though the children are no\nlonger in need of his supervision or at-home care. \nIt also was in 2000 that Applicant had the first of two spinal surgeries that caused\nher to be placed on medical leave reducing her income by 2/3s. She was out of work for\nover five months after that surgery. The second surgery was in 2001 and she was out of\nwork for six weeks. Each surgery cost $40,000 to $50,000. Her insurance paid 90% of\nthe cost but she was required to pay the balance. It was during the period of illness and\nunemployment that many of the debts were incurred. \nAt the time Applicant submitted answers to interrogatories in August 2008, she\nhad a negative monthly cash flow of $197. Several weeks ago, she received a\npromotion and pay increase of $2.50 per hour so her net monthly gross income has\nincreased by $400 (Tr. 48-49). Also, she has taken steps over the last six months to\nreduce her housing costs with a smaller home paying less rent, and uses less utilities.\nShe is also making wiser purchasing decisions for her family. She no longer pays auto\ninsurance for her son\u2019s car. She now has a $600 per month positive balance at the end\nof the month (Tr. 45-53). She currently has a gross income of $5,300 per month and net\nincome of $4,100.\n\n3\nAn analysis of the current status of the delinquent debts listed on the SOR\nindicates as follows:\n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a.: Medical bill of $164 from one of the surgeries on which there has\nbeen no payment (Tr. 21).\n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b.: Visa charge of $1,485 for repair for her husband\u2019s auto. Payment\nplan has been established. The debt is being paid with $198 monthly payments and will\nbe fully paid in the next 60 days (Exh. 2, pp 4 and 5) (Tr. 22 and 55). \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c.: Medical bill of $604 is one of three bills from her hospitalization for\nsurgery that she intends to pay (Tr. 25). \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d.: Medical bill of $971 is the second of the bills from surgery (Tr. 25).\n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e.: Medical bill of $137 is the third of the bills from surgeries (Tr. 25).  \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f.: Visa credit card debt of $13,200 on a card that her sister named\nher as an authorized user when she was unemployed after her surgeries. The\naccumulated debt was approximately $8,000 and the additional amount is for interest\nand charges. Applicant charged approximately $4,000 on the card and has offered\nwithout success to pay her sister that amount since she believes the balance is for her\nsister\u2019s debts, and her sister\u2019s daughter\u2019s debts. Applicant made the last payment to be\nmade on the account in 2006 of $500. She has been in contact with the creditor about\nresolving the matter but without resolution since the company insisted on full pyment.\nHer mother has become involved in the issue, and expressed a willingness to either\nhelp pay the debt or try to resolve the conflict between the two sisters. A[[;ocamt\nrecognizes that she may have to pay the full amount and will do so if necessary (Tr. 26-\n32). \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g.: Although Applicant accepted responsibility for all the SOR debts,\nthis debt for $62 is unknown to Applicant (Tr. 32).\n8. SOR \u00b6 1.h.: Medical bill of $197 for emergency room services for Applicant\u2019s\nhusband which is not paid (Tr. 197). \n9. SOR \u00b6 1.i.: Medical clinic bill for $29 that she believes is her son\u2019s bill (Tr. 34). \n10. SOR \u00b6 1.j.: Direct TV bill of $196 which she will pay with increased income\n(Tr. 35). \n11. SOR \u00b6 1.k.: Quest Communications bill for $186 will be paid with increased\nmonthly income (Tr. 36). \n12. SOR \u00b6 1.l.: Cash advance amount of $307 to supplement income when\nunemployed will be paid with increased monthly income (Tr. 36). \n\n4\n13. SOR \u00b6 1.m.: Auto loan of $10,500 on 2003 Oldsmobile became delinquent\nbut she has paid the delinquency and, for several months has been paying $499 per\nmonth which is $100 more than the required payment (Tr. 39). She now has paid the\nloan down to $6,500 with a recent payment of $1,000 (Exh. A-2). \n14. SOR \u00b6 1.n.: Medical expense of $240 for her husband is not paid (Tr. 40). \n15. SOR \u00b6 1.o.: Auto insurance payment of $91 for her son\u2019s car has been paid\n(Tr. 41.). \nIn summary, Applicant has taken positive steps to pay or negotiate the three\nlargest debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 b., f., and m). The remaining debts total almost $3,000 of which\napproximately $2,500 is for medical expenses for herself, her son, and her husband\nwhich she is now able and willing to pay. She does not have any credit cards. Her\nprincipal asset is $11,000 of stock value in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan she has\naccumulated over the 15 years of employment with her company. \nApplicant is highly regarded by her supervisor who describes her as having\n\u201cdiligently worked for this organization and our Government customers for the past 15\nyears without one blemish on her work record.\u201d He has discussed her financial\ndifficulties with her and is convinced she can and will resolve the remaining debts. He\nexpressed amazement that she was faced with a problem as to her security clearance\nas she is the most worthy person in the organization. She started her employment as a\ndata collector and has grown steadily in her responsibilities to the company and its\npredecessor company. At one time she supervised 25 persons. She has received\nnumerous performance awards and letters of commendation for exemplary work (Exh.\nA-1).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\n\n6\nsecurity concerns.\u201d Applicant incurred delinquent debts over several years and most\nwere unresolved. The government established sufficient facts to raise a security concern.\nThe guideline also includes examples of mitigating conditions (MC) that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), the\nsecurity concern may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant had extensive medical\nexpenses which resulted in several months of unemployment. Those factors were the\nprimary cause of most of the indebtedness. Until recently her income was insufficient to\nallow her to resolve all the debts. However, she was able to work on the three largest\ndebts by developing a payment plan for one, paying her auto loan at an accelerated rate,\nand she is attempting to negotiate the credit card debt with her sister and the credit card\ncompany. \nWhile the debts have been owed for several years, I conclude that the Applicant\nhas done all that she could have done with her limited income to resolve the debts until\nrecently. She has worked for over fifteen years with the same employer and her income\nis only now sufficient to allow her to resolve all of the accumulated debts. She\nunderstands the impact of debts on her ability to hold a security clearance.I am confident\nshe will do so with oversight from her supervisor. Thus, I conclude that she has acted\nresponsibly and the mitigating condition is applicable. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(d) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nAlthough some of the debts have not been paid or a settlement negotiation initiated, they\nare the smaller debts and most relate to her medical bills or those of family members.\nShe has made substantial efforts to resolve the three largest delinquent debts which she\nfelt were the most important to protect against litigation and repossession. From the\nevidence presented, I find this mitigating condition is also applicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\n\n7\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant is a mature adult with significant responsibility in her work for which she\nis highly regarded by her company and her supervisor. She has grown in responsibility\nover the years of her employment. She has been generous to her own immediate family\nand is burdened by being the sole income provider for her family. Now that one of her\nsons is mature and no longer dependent on her, she can resolve her financial obligations\nmore quickly. She has taken positive and specific steps to reduce her expenses so that\nshe has more disposable income to resolve the remaining debts and remain solvent. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is substantial.\nApplicant\u2019s excellent record of employment weighs heavily in her favor. There is no\nevidence of any security infraction. She has taken actions that she was able to undertake\nwith her limited income and substantial family obligations after her extensive medical\nexpenses and periods of unemployment as a result thereof. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed key element in the whole person analysis for\nfinancial cases as being establishment of a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d This does not\nrequire that every debt be paid but that an applicant demonstrate a plan sand taken\nsignificant steps to implement the plan. All outstanding debts do not need to be\naddressed simultaneously, and may provide for payment of debts one at a time. There is\nno reason not to trust Applicant to do what she intends to do, or to in any way\ncompromise national security. (ISCR Case No. 07-06482 App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on December 20, 2007. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \nJune 4, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn December 5, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).2 In his Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized on January 8, 2009, \nApplicant admitted all allegations except allegations 1.c. and 1.d. He also requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 6, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me the following day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nFebruary 25, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 18, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, the government offered 13 exhibits, marked as Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 13, which were admitted. Applicant testified and offered 21 \nexhibits, which were admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through U. I held the record \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. On March 31, 2009, Applicant \noffered two additional documents. Department Counsel forwarded the documents, and I \nadmitted them into the record as AE V and W. DOHA received the transcript on March \n26, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement \nof Reasons, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 50 years old, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business in 1982. He \nmarried in 2002 and has a three-year-old son and a two-month old daughter (Tr. 46). He \nalso has a 20-year-old stepchild (GE 1).  \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n\n \n \n3\n                                                \nApplicant has worked as a security officer for several firms since 1998 (GE 1).3 \nCurrently, he holds two positions. He is employed full-time by a security firm, and also \npart-time at another security firm (Tr. 51-53). Applicant earns $30,000 annually in his \nfull-time position. However, his W-2 for 2008 shows annual income of $37,618 from this \nposition because he works overtime (AE V; Tr. 52). He earns $13.50 per hour at his \npart-time position. His income from this job varies depending on the number of hours he \nworks; for the first two weeks of March 2009, he earned a gross income of $972, and \nnet income of $840 (AE V). Applicant estimates his total 2009 income from both jobs will \nbe approximately $50,000 to $60,000 (Tr. 89-90).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife also works. However, she stopped working during her first \npregnancy in 2006 (GE 3). She is currently on leave because of the recent birth of their \nsecond child. Applicant expects that she will return to work in a few months. He testified \nthat she made $17,000 in 2008, but her 2008 W-2 shows gross annual earnings of \n$8,629.50 (AE W). Applicant testified that when his wife works, he has about $200 or \nmore remaining each month after paying expenses, but when she is not working, he \ndoes not have money remaining at the end of the month. (Tr. 97-98). However, his \nPersonal Financial Statement of September 2008 shows that, even with his spouse\u2019s \nsalary of $1,300 per month included, Applicant had a negative monthly remainder of \n$482 (GE 2). \n \nApplicant denied allegation 1.c., which alleges that he owes a debt of $4,461 to a \nleasing company. In 2004, Applicant operated a small business chartering his boat for \nhire. He testified that he was pressured into a contract with a leasing company under \nwhich the company would provide him with a website for his business, internet \nadvertising, and a credit card machine if he paid a fee of $100 per month. He realized \nafter several months that the business would not be profitable, and sought to be \nreleased from the contract. The company refused and claimed that he owed them \napproximately $4,248. Applicant claimed that, \u201cI was pressured into signing a \nmisleading contract with the promise of huge rewards.\u201d (GE 2). In May 2005, a law firm \nhired by the company issued a demand letter seeking full payment. Applicant believes \nthat he does not owe this debt because his agreement was based on false information \nfrom the company (GE 12; AE E; Tr. 54-58). \n \nApplicant also denied allegation 1.d., relating to a state tax lien. He lives in State \nB, and bought a boat in State C. He testified that he registered the boat in State B, paid \nthe sales tax, and uses the boat there. However, he used a marina in State A when he \nwas operating his charter boat business (Tr. 64-65). When he realized the charter \nbusiness was not profitable, he moved the boat to State B. In December 2004, State A \ninformed him that he owed $1,261.90 because \u201cuse has been established in [State A]; \ntherefore, the tax balance is due.\u201d In February 2005, State A filed a judgment against \n \n3 Applicant testified that he was unemployed for six months around 2008, but his security clearance \napplication did not indicate any periods of unemployment (GE 1; Tr. 78). \n\n \n \n4\n                                                \nApplicant for $1,552 in unpaid tax (AE F; G). He has not paid the tax. He attempted to \npay a penalty, but it was not accepted (Tr. 105). He does not believe he owes tax to \nState A: \u201cThis bill is for sales taxes--however they are not entitled since a (sic) live in \n[State B]--I kept the boat in [State A] waters\u2014they are only entitled to a penalty or fine.\u201d \n(GE 2; 5; 12; Tr. 58-64).  \n \n \nApplicant retained a debt-payment company from 2004 to 2006 to help resolve \nhis debts (GE 2; 3; Tr. 66).4 He planned to pay his credit card debts, hospital bills \nrelated to a miscarriage and his son\u2019s birth in 2006, and other debts through a three-\nyear payment plan (GE 2; Tr. 37). He also hoped to improve his credit score so that he \ncould lower the interest rate he paid on his home mortgage (Tr. 42). Applicant paid \napproximately $3,000 in up-front fees, at a rate of $225 per month (AE D, N, T; Tr. 41). \nThe company promised to negotiate settlements of 20 to 50 percent less than the \namount he owed (AE A). In 2004, the company obtained from one creditor a lower \nsettlement offer than Applicant had obtained (AE U).5 Applicant thought that the \ncompany would have the same success with his other creditors. He decided to stop \npaying the creditors, with the expectation of receiving settlement offers (Tr. 39). \nHowever, several creditors, including the credit card companies, would not agree to \nsettle and the debt-payment company failed to negotiate any other settlements. The \ndebt-payment company did not return Applicant's $3,000 fee (Tr. 40-41), and he \nsevered his relationship. \n \n \nThe debt-payment company also told Applicant that paying the credit card debts \nis not a priority. Applicant agrees, stating that they charge exorbitant interest (Tr. 44). \nHe stated in September 2008 that he was \u201cunable to pay any credit cards due to \nfinancial reasons. Also, when I was able to pay they refused a settlement and put me \ndeeper into debts [sic].\u201d (GE 3). Applicant stated in his Interrogatory response that he \nwould \u201ctry to offer a settlement in the future if I can afford it and if they take it.\u201d (GE 2). \nHowever, at the hearing, when asked if he had done anything since he stopped using \nthe debt-payment company, he answered, \u201cNo, I basically let time go by, you know, \nand see what's going happen [sic].\u201d (Tr. 99).  \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 1999, before his current \nmarriage, which was discharged the same year (GE 4). His current debts became \ndelinquent because he has had two children since 2006, and his income has not \nsignificantly increased (Tr. 99). He maintains that he showed good faith by using the \ndebt-payment company and obtaining a hardship loan from his 401k to make his \nmortgage payment (Tr. 43; AE S). His failure to pay his debts resulted from inability, \nrather than a refusal to pay (Tr. 47; 120). He believes \u201csome of the small debts can be \npaid if I continue working and if has (sic) a positive effect on keeping my clearance.\u201d \n \n4 AE O shows that payments were deducted from Applicant\u2019s account in March and April 2007 as well. \n \n5 This debt is not alleged in the SOR. \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \n(GE 2). He also testified at the hearing that he \u201cis willing to pay if I can keep the \nclearance.\u201d (Tr. 127). \n \nThe Statement of Reasons alleges 12 debts, totaling $23,232. Applicant's  \ndelinquencies started in 2004 (allegation 1.e.) and continued to occur until at least 2007 \n(allegation 1.l.) (GE 12). \n \n$ \nMedical debts (allegations 1.b., 1.j., and 1.k.) totaling $2,266  \n \n$ \nCredit cards (allegations 1.e. through 1.i.) \u2013 totaling $13,983 \n \n$        Cable and telephone debts (allegations 1.l. and 1.m.) \u2013 totaling $970 \n \n$ \nLeasing company (allegation 1.c.) \u2013 totaling $4,461  \n \n$ \nState tax lien (allegation 1.d.) \u2013 totaling $1,552. \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).6 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition under a \nGuideline does not determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant.  However, \nspecific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access \nto classified information.  In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by \nthe parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors \naddressed under Guideline F (Financial considerations). \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest7 for an Applicant to have access to \nclassified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible \ninformation on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security \nclearance. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to \n \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n\n \n \n6\n                                                \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a \nsecurity clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.8 A person who \nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the \ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as his or her own. The \n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.9 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe facts presented support application of AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant was unable to meet his debts because of a combination of facts: he earned a \nrelatively low income; his wife did not work during her two pregnancies; and his income \ndid not keep pace with the rising expense of his growing family. However, Applicant's \nstatements also indicate that he is unwilling to pay certain debts: the high credit card \ndebts, because the companies charge exorbitant interest rates; the leasing company \ndebt, because the company did not perform as he expected; and State A, because it \nshould not have taxed him for using his boat in their waters. Both elements of AG \n\u00b619(a)\u2013inability and unwillingness\u2013apply. AG \u00b619(c) also applies because many of \nApplicant\u2019s debts, which started becoming delinquent around 2004, still appear in his \n \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n7\nlatest credit bureau reports, and remained unpaid as of the date of the hearing, \ndemonstrating a five-year history of failure to meet his financial obligations.  \n \n \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. The following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b620(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b620(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b620(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b620(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are numerous, amounting to approximately $23,000, and they \nare recent, as they currently remain unpaid. Given his negative monthly net remainder \nin his September 2008 financial statement, and the fact that his wife might not be \nreturning to work for some time, I conclude that Applicant's debts will likely continue. In \naddition, Applicant's statement that he has simply let time pass, doing nothing about \nthe debts, raises questions as to his trustworthiness and reliability. AG \u00b620(a) does not \napply. \n \nThe key element in mitigating condition AG \u00b620(b) is that the factors that caused \nthe financial problems were beyond an Applicant\u2019s control. The circumstances that \naffected Applicant's ability to meet his debts were his growing family, the resulting \nincreased expenses, and his wife\u2019s inability to work during her pregnancies. Once \nApplicant married in 2002, he could anticipate these events. They are not the kind of \nunforeseen events--such as death or unemployment--that are contemplated under AG \n\u00b620(b) and this mitigating condition cannot be applied. \n \n \nAG 20 \u00b6(c) and 20(d) relate to efforts to resolve debts. Although Applicant has \nnot sought financial counseling, he did make a good-faith effort to deal with his debts in \n2004, when he retained a debt-payment service. He made payments for approximately \ntwo years, paying a total of about $3,000. AG 20 \u00b6(d) applies. However, the company \ndid not obtain settlements, and the relationship ended with none of his debts resolved. \nApplicant remains in debt for more than $20,000. AG 20 \u00b6(c) does not apply. Overall, \nthe mitigation available is under AG 20 \u00b6(d) is insufficient to overcome the fact that he \n\n \n \n8\nremains substantially indebted, and has not taken any further steps in the past three \nyears to meet his financial obligations. I resolve Guideline F against Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nAt the time his debts started to become delinquent in 2004, Applicant was a \nmature and experienced adult approximately 45 years of age. His actions and his \nattitude toward his debts raise questions as to his good judgment. He denies \nresponsibility for certain debts that appear to be legitimate debts: the leasing company \ndebt, where he contractually obligated himself to pay for services; the credit card debt, \nwhich he disputes because of the additional interest that has been added to the original \ndebt; and the state tax on his boat, which he disputes even though he agrees that he \noperated his chartering business in the waters of that state. In addition, Applicant \nappears to believe that he should only pay debts when the creditor agrees to settle for \nsignificantly less than the balance owed. His statement that he has let his debts go \nunpaid, waiting to see what would happen, indicates a negligent attitude about his \nlegitimate financial obligations, and a likelihood that they will remain unpaid. Finally, his \nstatement that he would make payments on his debts if it would result in obtaining a \nsecurity clearance underscores that he is motivated by his own desires rather than by a \ndesire to meet his obligations. His attitude and conduct demonstrate a lack of reliability \nand good judgment. \n \n\n \n \n9\n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.m. \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns based on financial \nconsiderations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 12, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust \nPositions (SF 85P). On May 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for a public trust position, citing \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was \ntaken under Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on \nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nMay 19, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility to occupy an automated data processing (ADP) position, and it \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \nan ADP position. \n \nOn September 2, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. She elected \nto have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated October 21, 2009, was provided to \nher by letter dated October 27, 2009. She received the FORM on November 10, 2009. \nShe did not respond to the FORM and submitted no material in refutation, extenuation, \nand mitigation. The case was assigned to me on January 19, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the 42 SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and her answers to DOHA interrogatories, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. She has worked in an ADP position for a defense \ncontractor since October 2006. Her current employer is sponsoring Applicant for a \npublic trust position. She received her General Educational Development (GED) \ncertificate in June 2001, and attended college during 2005-2006, but has not completed \na degree. She married in early 2008. She has two children, ages nine and three.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application shows she was employed from \nJanuary 2002 until June 2005 (cashier and customer service representative); from \nAugust 2005 until October 2006 (financial advisor at a university); and since October \n2006 with her current employer. She was unemployed from October 2001 to January \n2002, from June 2005 to August 2005, and from April 2006 to October 2006.  \n \nIn her October 2007 public trust position application, Applicant disclosed many of \nthe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Her background investigation addressed her \nfinancial problems. Applicant\u2019s April 2008 personal subject interviews show she was \nforthcoming with the investigator, admitting many of her delinquent debts and explaining \nher financial situation. At her interview, Applicant stated she did not have the financial \nmeans to pay her delinquent debts, but that she had recently married and with the \nadditional income she was hoping to make some progress paying her debts. She \npromised to seek assistance from a credit counseling organization. She admitted she \nwas embarrassed by her financial situation, but stated her credit situation could not be \nused to blackmail her.  \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all 42 delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR totaling $20,000. These debts are unresolved. In general, the delinquent debts \ninclude a repossessed car, delinquent credit accounts, retailer accounts, utilities, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nnumerous telephone service accounts, student loans, and 28 delinquent medical \naccounts.  \n \nIn September 2009, Applicant wrote a letter to DOHA stating that she had started \ntaking the necessary steps to repair her credit. She indicated that her student loans \nwere no longer in default, that she was paying $275 monthly toward her student loans, \nand started school again. She explained she intended to address her medical bills next, \nmake contact with other creditors, and attempt to settle some of her delinquent debts. \nShe averred she now understood the importance of having good credit. \n \nIn October 2009, DOHA asked Applicant to document her efforts to resolve her \ndelinquent debts with evidence of payments, settlements, or contact with creditors. In \nher response, Applicant stated: \u201cI did not provide documentation because at this time I \ncan not afford to make any payments towards this debt because of financial problems.\u201d \n(Item 6)  \n \nApplicant presented little evidence of paid debts, negotiations, or of any \nreasonable effort to resolve her delinquent debts before or after she was issued the \nSOR. A government investigator confronted her concerning his financial problems in \nApril 2008. She promised to address her delinquent debts, and has failed to show \nreasonable efforts to fulfill her promises. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government\u2019s authority to restrict access to \nclassified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access \nto information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527.  \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s controlling adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.   \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See \nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to \nthe Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the trustworthiness concern is that failure or inability to live \nwithin one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented. She admitted all 42 \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR totaling $20,000, most of which have been \ndelinquent for many years. She presented no evidence of paid debts, negotiations, or \nother efforts to resolve her delinquent debts before or after she was issued the SOR.  \nAG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established some circumstances beyond her control contributing to her \ninability to pay her taxes, i.e., her periods of unemployment and being a single mother \nof two. Notwithstanding, none of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior is recent because all of her debts are unresolved. The evidence is not \nsufficient to fully raise circumstances beyond her control, that she received financial \ncounseling, that she made good-faith efforts to resolve any of her outstanding \ndelinquent debts, or that she had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of her \ndelinquent debts. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, her failure to show diligence and efforts to \nresolve her financial obligations shows lack of judgment or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations. Her behavior cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nor public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman, and a \ngood mother. She has been successfully working for a government contractor for close \nto three years. There is no evidence of any security violation, or that she is not a \ncompetent worker. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation. \n \n  \nOn the other hand, there are more substantial circumstances that weigh against \nApplicant in the whole-person analysis. Applicant has been fully employed since \nOctober 2006. She presented no evidence of paid debts, negotiations, or other efforts to \nresolve her delinquent debts even after she was issued the SOR. A government \ninvestigator confronted her concerning her financial problems in April 2008. She \npromised to address her delinquent debts, and she failed to show any reasonable effort \nto accomplish her promises.  \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s financial behavior raises doubt \nabout her ability to have access to sensitive information and her trustworthiness. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns \narising from her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.pp:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \noccupy an ADP I/II/III position. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant replied to the SOR by admitting all the allegations of indebtedness (nine delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $171 to $16,726 for a total of about $46,817). Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is a high-school graduate who has worked as an electronics engineer technician since November 2007. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time. Applicant finished high school in 2002. Since then, his employment history has included jobs as an apprentice electrician, delivery driver, deck hand, and waiter, although his main occupation was as an apprentice electrician. He was employed as an apprentice electrician in August 2006 when he had a skateboarding accident that knocked him unconsciousness. Rescue personnel were called to the scene, and Applicant was transported by ambulance to an airfield where he was flown by helicopter to a hospital. He had regained consciousness, but was subject to tests at the hospital. He suffered no serious head injury and all tests were normal. He was released the same day. He had just started a new job a few months before the accident, and so he did not yet have medical insurance, but he did not miss any work due to the accident.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of\n1\nreasons (SOR) to Applicant on January 28, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to an\nadministrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues here\nfall under Guideline F for financial considerations. \nJuly 24, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant replied to the SOR on February 4, 2009, and he requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 1, 2009. The hearing took place on June 2, 2009,\nduring which testimony was taken and Exhibits 1\u20136 and A were admitted. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on June 10, 2009. The record was kept open until June 16, 2009, to\nallow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. He did so in\na timely manner and that document is marked and admitted, without objections, as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for\nApplicant.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant replied to the SOR by admitting all the allegations of indebtedness\n(nine delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $171 to $16,726 for a total of about\n$46,817). Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established\nby substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is a high-school\ngraduate who has worked as an electronics engineer technician since November 2007.\nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time. \nApplicant finished high school in 2002. Since then, his employment history has\nincluded jobs as an apprentice electrician, delivery driver, deck hand, and waiter,\nalthough his main occupation was as an apprentice electrician. He was employed as an\napprentice electrician in August 2006 when he had a skateboarding accident that\nknocked him unconsciousness. Rescue personnel were called to the scene, and\nApplicant was transported by ambulance to an airfield where he was flown by helicopter\nto a hospital. He had regained consciousness, but was subject to tests at the hospital.\nHe suffered no serious head injury and all tests were normal. He was released the\nsame day. He had just started a new job a few months before the accident, and so he\ndid not yet have medical insurance, but he did not miss any work due to the accident. \nApplicant was unable to pay the uninsured medical bills stemming from his\nmedical transportation and treatment. He also fell behind on his other debts. In about\nFebruary 2007, he consulted a law firm to assist him in paying off the medical debts. He\npaid $189 monthly for about 12 months, but he quit because he did not think this plan\nwas showing sufficient progress.  \nApplicant retained the services of a bankruptcy lawyer in September 2008\n(Exhibit 2). A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was filed in February 2009, and the\nbankruptcy court granted Applicant a discharge in May 2009 (Exhibits 6 and B). The\nschedules to the Chapter 7 petition list $21,976 in total assets and $93,728 in total debt.\nThe Schedule F lists $59,578 in unsecured creditors, to include approximately $24,000\nowed to seven medical creditors. \nIt appears all the debts at issue in the SOR were included in the Chapter 7\nbankruptcy case. Five of the nine debts in the SOR were medical accounts stemming\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n2\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n3\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n4\n3\nfrom his skateboarding accident. Those five debts totaled about $16,086, of which more\nthan $13,000 was based on the cost of the helicopter flight. Of the remaining four debts\nin the SOR, the largest is a $16,726 debt owed to a bank for a deficiency on a 2003\nDodge Ram truck. Applicant bought the truck in 2006 (before the accident) for a friend\nwho made the payments on the loan. The friend served three months in jail in 2007 and\nmade no payments during that time. Applicant made no payments, and the truck was\nrepossessed in about January 2008. The other large debt is a $11,677 credit card\naccount that went into default and then collection after Applicant incurred the medical\nbills. \nApplicant\u2019s group manager believes that Applicant has \u201cperformed very well not\nonly technically but in how he handled himself\u201d (Tr. at 33). The group manager has\ntaken an active interest in Applicant, and, in turn, Applicant sought out his assistance for\nthis proceeding. The group manager has counseled Applicant on financial matters,\nexplaining concepts such as debt, interest accruals, income, assets, savings, and payoff\nexpectations (Exhibit A). The group manager analyzed Applicant\u2019s indebtedness and\nconcluded that it spiked with the uninsured medical bills.   \nHis gross income for 2008 was about $48,000. He earns an hourly wage and\nusually earns a gross monthly income of about $2,800, but that does not include\novertime. He currently has no credit card debt, he has some savings, he participates in\nhis company\u2019s 401(k) plan, and he is sharing living expenses with roommates. He now\nunderstands that it was foolish of him to sign loan paperwork for a friend, and he also\nunderstands the dangers of becoming financially overextended (Tr. at 68\u201369).   \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a security clearance\ndecision is to decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information, and it\nis well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.  \n2\nA favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted a security\nclearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An unfavorable\n3\ndecision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any existing security clearance; and (3)\nprevents access to classified information at any level.  \n4\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n11\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n12\n4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n5\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n7\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n8\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n9\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.10\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n12\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n13\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n14\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n15\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n16\n5\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n13\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n14\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems raises security concerns because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n15\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence shows\n16\nApplicant incurred more than $45,000 of delinquent debt, which is a particularly large\namount given his youthful age. Even setting aside the medical debts, there is still about\n$30,000 in delinquent debt. And the Chapter 7 bankruptcy paperwork reveals still more\ndebt. These facts and circumstances are more than sufficient to establish these two\ndisqualifying conditions. And the same facts and circumstances suggest financial\nirresponsibility. \nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 1\u20132. \n17\n6\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and three apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. First, MC 2 applies because the uninsured medical debts were due to\nan unexpected medical emergency that was largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. He\nacted responsibly under the circumstances by attempting to pay the debts through a\npayment plan. Second, MC 3 applies because Applicant, via the Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nproceeding, went through mandated financial counseling, and he obtained a discharge\nfrom legal liability for any debts included in the bankruptcy. Given these circumstances,\nthere are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are now resolved or are\nunder control. Third, MC 4 applies because Applicant made a good-faith effort, albeit\nunsuccessful, to address his indebtedness via the repayment plan. His termination of\nthe plan due to lack of progress does not negate his good faith by initiating the effort.  \nI also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept, which requires\nan administrative judge to evaluate a person\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the\nperson\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.  \n17\nSeveral of these factors apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. Factor 2 applies because the\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s financial problems show that the uninsured\nmedical debts were the tipping point that caused his financial condition to deteriorate to\nthe point where it overwhelmed him. Factor 4 applies because Applicant was young and\ninexperienced when he incurred the indebtedness. He is now more savvy and mature\nand better equipped to handle his financial responsibilities. And factors 8 and 9 apply\nbecause\u2014with the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case completed\u2014both the potential for\n\n7\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress as well as the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence of financial problems are low. At this time, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are\nno longer overwhelming, and he is not in the middle of financial turmoil. He is on the\nway to putting his financial house in good order. On balance, I am persuaded that\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is a thing of the past and will not be an item of\nconcern in the future. \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant met his ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.i:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.   \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Accordingly, her request for a position of public \ntrust is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an application for a public trust position (SF 85P),1 which \nshe signed on August 24, 2007, again on October 19, 2007, and a third time on \nDecember 4, 2007. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, \nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1  Trustworthiness determinations, including applications for ADP I, II and III positions, are adjudicated \nunder DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended, in accordance with the memorandum of the Deputy \nUnder Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security), dated November 19, 2004. \n  \nJuly 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding2 that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn March 27, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \n(Item 1), that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 31, 2009. She submitted a signed Answer, \nnotarized on April 19, 2009, in which she admitted to all allegations under Guideline F, \nand noted that she paid the debts listed at allegations 1.c., 1.g., and 1.j. She admitted to \nthe allegation concerning deliberate falsification under Guideline E, but noted that she \nmisunderstood the question. In her Answer, she also requested a decision without a \nhearing. On May 6, 2009, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant \nmaterials (FORM)3 in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant was \ngiven 30 days from the date she received the FORM to file a response. She timely \nforwarded a response with five attachments. The case was assigned to me on June 25, \n2009, for an administrative decision based on the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 30 years old, is a high school graduate, currently employed in the \nhealth care field as a Data Verification Analyst. According to her security clearance \napplication of late 2007, she is unmarried, and has a seven-year-old child. Applicant \nheld positions between 2001 and 2007 as an inspector in a cheese company, a \ncustomer\u2019s representative, and in assembly. She was unemployed for approximately six \nmonths between 2000 and 2001, ten months between 2002 and 2003, and three \nmonths in 2006 (Item 5).  \n \n \nApplicant is a single mother and does not receive child support for her daughter \n(Item 6; Response to FORM). A major portion of her delinquencies relates to medical \ndebts. Applicant indicated her \u201c\u2026child has been sick and has had many doctor\u2019s \nappointments.\u201d She did not explain in her Response whether these visits related to \ntypical childhood illness, or involved a major medical event that would affect her ability \nto meet her debts. Most of the medical debts are relatively small.  \n \n \n2 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n3 See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 14 documents (Items 1 - 14) proffered \nin support of the government\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nIn her Interrogatory answer, Applicant reported a gross monthly income of $1956 \nand deductions of $281, leaving a net monthly income of $1,675. Appellant's rent, food, \nand clothing and other monthly expenses total $1,459, leaving a monthly net remainder \nof $215. She did not list payments on any of the SOR debts. She noted in her response \nto Interrogatories that she is \u201cjust making ends meet\u201d and that she has not taken steps \nto resolve most of her debts (Item 7). There is no indication that Applicant sought any \ntype of financial counseling. \n \n \nThe 30 debts listed in the SOR amount to approximately $21,000. Applicant's \ndebts became delinquent between 2002 and 2007 (Item 8). In her Response to the \nFORM, she stated that she satisfied a medical debt of $100. However, she did not \nindicate the corresponding SOR debt, nor did she provide evidence of payment. She \nalso stated that she paid the debt alleged at 1.g., but provided no evidence to support \nher claim. The record evidence is unclear as to whether a document she submitted \n(Answer document 6) relates to allegation 1.b. She did provide evidence that she paid \ntwo debts that were alleged in the SOR:  \n \n\u2022 1.c. Judgment by state Department of Workforce Development, $540; (Response \ndocument 4)4 \n\u2022 1.j. Utility bill, $300; see Response document 2) \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose her delinquent debts when she answered the following \nquestion on her public trust position application: \u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent \non any loan or financial obligation?\u201d She completed her application in August 2007 (Item \n5). She re-certified the application in October 2007 and in December 2007, but did not \nmake any changes. At her interview in March 2008, Applicant discussed the status of all \nof her delinquent debts. She stated that she did not remember if she had listed the \ndebts on her application (Item 6). In her Answer, she admitted that she did not disclose \nthis information, but stated that she \u201cdid not understand that all the things listed in \ncollection is what I was answering to.\u201d (Item 4).  \n \n \nApplicant noted in her Response to the FORM that when she returns from her job \nafter business hours, it is difficult to contact creditors to \u201cget clarification of the debts I \nhave paid.\u201d She submitted a performance evaluation for the period June through \nDecember 2008, showing an overall rating of \u201cExceeds Expectations\u201d (Response \ndocument 1). She stated that \u201c\u2026even though I have bad credit it does not affect my job. \nI know it is important to pay all of these debts, and I hope to do that in the future.\u201d \n(Response to FORM).  \n \nPolicies \n \nEach trustworthiness decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \n \n4 Although the SOR did not allege it, Applicant failed to disclose this judgment in response to question 22a \nin her public trust position application (Item 5). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).5 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition under any \nguideline does not determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against \nthem, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to \nsensitive information. \n \nA trustworthiness decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or continue \nto have access to sensitive information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke an applicant\u2019s access to sensitive information. Additionally, the government must \nbe able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its \nburden, it falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. \n \nA person who has access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as her \nor his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \n \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).  \n \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00a72(b). \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence contained in the FORM shows that Applicant owes debts that \nstarted becoming delinquent in approximately 2002. Her seven-year history of failing to \nmeet her financial obligations supports application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619 (a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following conditions that can potentially mitigate security \nconcerns are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s failure to meet her financial obligations began approximately \nseven years ago, it remains a current problem because most of her debts are still \nunresolved. Given that Applicant has provided only a promise to pay them in the future, \nand has no documented plan in place, I cannot confidently predict that she will resolve \nthe situation. AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot be applied. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some application because Applicant has been unemployed twice \nsince her delinquencies began in 2002. As a result, she has been supporting herself \nand her child on limited resources, and without child support. However, to be applicable, \nthis mitigating condition requires that the person act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Although she provided evidence that she paid two of the SOR debts, the \nrecord contains no evidence that Applicant acted responsibly by taking steps during the \npast several years to seek counseling or set up a plan to resolve her many remaining \ndebts. AG \u00b620 (b) does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) are also unavailable. Applicant has not sought \nassistance through financial counseling. Although she has paid several debts, a large \n\n \n6 \n \n \nnumber remain unpaid with no indication of a plan to resolve them. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply, and I find against the Applicant on Guideline F. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities). When she completed her security clearance application in \n2007, Applicant disclosed none of her past due debts (Item 5). Most of her debts \nbecame delinquent between 2002 and 2007, before she completed her application. She \nstated during her subject interview that she did not remember if she listed her debts on \nher security clearance application. Her statement is not credible, as her interview \noccurred only three months after she last re-certified her application. It is unlikely that \nshe would have forgotten to disclose her financial situation, which involves a large \nnumber of delinquent debts. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that she did \nnot list her debts because she misunderstood the question on the application, and did \nnot realize she was expected to list debts that were in collection status (Item 4). \nHowever, the question is written in straightforward language, and Applicant's \neducational background is sufficient for her to understand its meaning. I find that \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose her delinquencies to the government.  \n \n \nThe potentially applicable mitigators are AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, \ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts) and AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Neither condition applies. The record \ncontains no evidence that Applicant attempted to inform the government of her financial \ndelinquencies at any point before she was confronted with them at her interview. In \naddition, Applicant\u2019s falsification cannot be considered insignificant under AG \u00b6 17(c). \nThe government relies on information provided by applicants, and falsification both \nundermines the adjudication process, and casts doubt on an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information be evaluating the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and \nhave applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guidelines. I have also \nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant access to \nsensitive information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the appropriate \nguidelines, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is a single parent, and has experienced some periods of \nunemployment. She has accrued significant debt since 2002, amounting to \napproximately $21,000. She has paid two of the debts alleged in the SOR, or about \n$840, but has no plan to deal with the approximately $20,000 of debt that remains. \nMoreover, Applicant's deliberate failure to disclose her debts on her application \nindicates a lack of trustworthiness that is incompatible with the standards required of \nthose who hold trustworthiness positions. A fair and common-sense assessment of the \navailable information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a position of public trust \nshows she has not satisfied the doubts about her ability or willingness to protect the \ngovernment\u2019s interests. Such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.b.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d. \u2013 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k. \u2013 1.dd.: \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request to occupy a \nposition of public trust.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 8, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On March 11, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues: whether the Judge failed to consider record evidence\nfavorable to Applicant and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant has applied for a job with\na Defense contractor, to serve as a linguist and cultural advisor.  He had immigrated to the U.S. from\nPakistan in the early 1970s and became a naturalized citizen in the early 1990s.  \nApplicant had significant delinquent debts, including one owed to the state lottery\ncommission for $68,501.  He incurred these debts from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, when he\nowned a grocery store.  The store failed during an economic downturn.  Additionally, Applicant\u2019s\nstore was robbed, which also caused him economic loss.  \nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted the business downturn, a\ncircumstance beyond Applicant\u2019s control which affected his financial condition.  However, the Judge\nstated that \u201cApplicant offered no evidence that he has made any payments to any creditors.  There\nis no evidence that he has contacted any of his creditors.  In short, there is no evidence the Applicant\nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances.  There are no clear indications that his financial\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.  He has not established financial responsibility.\u201d\nDecision at 9.  Accordingly, the Judge held that Applicant had failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns in his case.\nApplicant\u2019s brief appears to contend that Applicant submitted documents to the Judge after\nthe hearing but that the documents were not considered.  However, the Judge\u2019s decision indicates\nthat the documents in question were admitted into evidence.  Decision at 2.  Applicant has not\nrebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,\n2008).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The $12,255 judgment amount represents interest and penalties. \nApplicant has not paid or resolved this debt. GE 6, Tr. 20-26. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a $613 collection account owed to an automobile insurance \ncompany for an automobile owned by Applicant that was repossessed in 2005.

GE 5, Tr. 26-31. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a $68,501 collection account owed to the state lottery commission \nthat supplied him lottery tickets at his store. Applicant testified that he was current with \nhis state lottery ticket account until he experienced four robberies in \u201cDecember (2004) \nto January (2005)\u201d with the last robbery occurring on January 16, 2005. When queried \nby Department Counsel whether the amount owed was from losses sustained from the \nfour robberies, Applicant responded, \u201cYes, and four robberies and plus my loss, what I \nlost in the store, you know. I use (sic) the money to cover up here and there.\u201d Source \ndocuments from the state lottery commission indicate that as of July 27, 2009, \nApplicant\u2019s debt to the lottery commission was $89,380.84 as a result of collection fees \nand interest.

Tr. 32-44. \n \n \n2 These dates are derived from Applicant\u2019s September 2007 e-QIP, p. 13. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel made the point that Applicant\u2019s problems of falling behind \nwith the state lottery commission were not limited to the string of robberies in December \n2004 and January 2005. The following is Applicant\u2019s verbatim explanation and response \nto Department Counsel as reflected in the transcript: \n \nI believe the business had a problem, but that\u2019s the way (of) the business. \nIt\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s absolutely the business was had a problem and not doing \nwell. So, you know, I was here and there, put it here, put it there. And then \nI was doing this to try to (do) what I can do to run the business. When you \nsee that things is getting out of my hand, it\u2019s started getting worse and \nended up here. The robbery, things happened to me. And I says it\u2019s \ngetting worse and worse and then I have to shut it down, the business. \nThat\u2019s the only thing to happen. This is you know, I\u2019m just give you, asking \nfor one minute, please. This is job I apply just because I worry about my \nlot of money. It\u2019s not going to be gone on me until I\u2019m out of debt. Let me \ntell you this way. I want to pay this money. I\u2019m honestly telling you I want \nto pay this money. That\u2019s why I apply for this job. If I got this job, in one \nyear, I work for one year and you\u2019re going to see the difference in one \nyear how much I pay them back. I have a lawyer. My lawyer is still talking \nto them. If you see my lawyer, he was talking to them and he will come to \nthe agreement with a lot of company to pay them up. I back up because I \ndon\u2019t have any money to pay them. If you see a couple of cases have \nbeen solved here. Maybe because they\u2019re dealing with a client who can\u2019t \npay the money so they kept the money, kept down the interest. Even my \nlawyer, you can call him, I was serious to pay this money to them, but my \nhand and my money was so tied and I have four kids to support them, to \nfeed them. That\u2019s most important than anything else for me. And that\u2019s the \nway I put on the \u2013 I applied for this job only for one reason. I\u2019m going to be \nout from my family, I\u2019m going to be out from kids, I\u2019m going to be out of my \nenjoyment, everything, to go there and suffer this country and make some \nmoney to pay these people off. This is the only my goal is. You ask me \n200, 300, 500 questions, I can answer you everything. But my business \nwas lost. I was lost. I was picking up the money here, put it here over \nthere, but I did not file my bankruptcy because I was very serious to pay \nthe lottery company. That\u2019s the most, most important to pay for me. This is \nfederal money. I know this is not going to go away until I pay them off. But \nthe main thing is this. I\u2019m making only money to feed my family. This job \nprovide me with money. I can sit with a lot of company, my lawyer talk to \nthem and pay them off slowly, slowly, which is the best way to do this, \nhandle these things. Tr. 44-47. \n \nApplicant has not paid or resolved this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is an $828 collection account from a utility company owed on his \nstore. Applicant testified that the utility company placed his account in collections when \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhe moved in 2007 and they did not have his current address. Applicant has not paid or \nresolved this debt. GE 4, Tr. 31-32. \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator on December 5, 2007. He indicated that he had encountered business \nproblems at his former grocery store and closed the business in 2005. He also indicated \nthat he had contacted the vendor who had secured a judgment against him in 2007 and \nhad agreed to repay him by monthly payments. Additionally, he informed the \ninvestigator that he would satisfy the debt to the insurance company within a week. GE \n2. \n \nApplicant was again interviewed by an OPM investigator on January 10, 2008 \nregarding the collection account owed to the state lottery commission. Applicant \nexplained at that time he was a victim of armed robbery at his grocery store in January \n2004 and suffered a casualty loss of approximately $60,000. This, according to \nApplicant, represents the net value of the lottery tickets which were purchased on credit \nfrom the state lottery commission. Applicant claimed that the state lottery commission \n\u201ccleared him of all past debts due to the aforementioned casualty loss and subsequent \nclosure of his corporate business.\u201d GE 2. Applicant submitted three business cards from \npolice detectives, who purportedly were assigned to investigate this robbery. AE E. He \ndid not submit any copies of police reports or correspondence with the state lottery \ncommission. The state lottery commission maintains the Applicant still owes the debt as \nalleged in the SOR plus interest and penalties. GE 7. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s December 9, 2008 Response to Interrogatories, he submitted a \nletter dated December 4, 2008 from a law firm, which indicates the firm has been \nretained to represent him on the judgment to the vendor, the collection account to the \ninsurance company, and the collection account to the utility company. The letter further \nindicates that Applicant earns $800 per week, and based on his salary and support \nobligations to his family, is unable to settle his past due accounts. However, if he were \nemployed as a translator, \u201chis income would be adequate to resolve these matters.\u201d GE \n3. Applicant did not submit any evidence that he has paid, settled or otherwise resolved \nany of the debts alleged.  \n \nApplicant submitted a letter dated September 9, 2009 from the same law firm \nindicating the firm also represents him on the debt owed to the state lottery commission \nas well as the other three creditors, discussed supra. AE A. Applicant submitted another \nletter dated September 24, 2009 from the same law firm stating again that the firm \nrepresented him on the judgment owed to the vendor. AE F. \n \nApplicant earns $800 per week as a limousine driver plus tips. His monthly rent is \n$1,500, his gas and electric bills are each $90 per month; his internet and cable is $100 \nper month; and his cell phone is $100 to $130 per month. He has undisclosed food \ncosts. He does not have a car payment, and his children go to public school. Tr. 52-54. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is unable to work because she has cancer. She does have good health \n\n \n6 \n \n \ninsurance, which only requires a $3 co-pay for medicine and a $5 co-pay for doctor \nappointments. Tr. 54-55. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant submitted an undated letter from the general manager of his limousine \nservice employer that he has been working as a driver for them since October 2006, \nand that he makes $800 per week. Furthermore, the general manager stated that \nApplicant has always been punctual, hard working, and very professional. AE B. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The Appeal Board has noted, \u201cApplicant\u2019s \ncredit report was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is \ndocumented in his credit reports, his OPM interview, his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories, his SOR response, and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to \nensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \nconditions is required.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he did \nnot act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He did not resolve all of his delinquent \nSOR debts through payment, established payment plans or disputes.   \n \n AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part. Applicant did experience a business downturn; \nhowever, his promise to resolve these debts at his hearing rings hollow given his \npromises to repay in the past and his past assertion that he was making payments. \nApplicant submitted no evidence that he has contacted creditors or has attempted to \notherwise resolve these debts. Several letters from a law firm advising they had been \nretained to handle these matters is insufficient. Applicant\u2019s medical coverage is \ncomprehensive and appears to cover medical costs associated with his wife\u2019s cancer \ntreatment except for modest co-pays.  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s discussion of AG \u00b6 20(b) in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. \nBd. Oct. 29, 2009) clarifies the applicability of this mitigating condition when an \nApplicant is unable to make substantial progress on delinquent debts after \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \ncircumstances outside an applicant\u2019s control cause delinquent debt. In ISCR Case No. \n08-06567 (A.J. July 27, 2009), the applicant had a judgment against him in June 2001 \nfor $7,948; an IRS tax lien in January 2001 for $25,441 from tax years 1993 to 1997 \n(since released), and a state tax lien in September 1999 for $6,701 (since released). \nThese three delinquent debts established a history of financial problems, which included \nsignificant tax problems extending over eight years (1993 to 2001). Id. at 2. In 2007, the \napplicant\u2019s business faltered (the circumstance beyond his control), and he generated \nabout $21,000 in additional delinquent debt. Id. at 3-4. He paid six of his new debts, and \nthree debts totaling about $17,000 remain for resolution. ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). He obtained financial counseling, developed a repayment \nplan, and took reasonable actions to effectuate his repayment plan. Id. at 3. The Appeal \nBoard at 3 determined that administrative judge erred when he failed to explain, \n \n.  .  .  what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the \ncircumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial \ncondition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not \u201cresponsible\u201d in \nlight of his limited circumstances.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s unfulfilled promises to repay debts with no subsequent action offer little \nreassurance of future repayment. He asserts if he is given a security clearance, he will \nbe able to get a job as a translator and cultural advisor and earn a salary that will allow \nhim to repay his creditors. Unfortunately, this option is not available. Furthermore, it is \nunclear what the state lottery commission\u2019s position is with respect to the armed robbery \nof Applicant\u2019s store and reported loss of lottery tickets during that robbery. What is \ncertain is the state lottery commission continues to pursue money owed to them, \nrobbery notwithstanding.  \n \n \nApplicant offered no evidence that he has made any payments to any creditors. \nThere is no evidence that he has contacted any of his creditors. In short, there is no \nevidence the Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. There are no \nclear indications that his financial problem is being resolved or is under control. He has \nnot established financial responsibility.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), (d), and (e) do not apply. Applicant has not sought counseling nor \nhas he indicated that he has a good-faith3 basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-due \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \ndebts. He did not establish good faith in the resolution of his SOR debts because he did \nnot adequately demonstrate his efforts to pay any of his debts after he closed his \nbusiness in 2005. He did not show sufficient adherence to his obligations. Applicant has \nnever disputed the legitimacy of the debts alleged. \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His debts resulted from a failed business, with \nthe added undetermined losses following several robberies. Applicant\u2019s debts have \nbeen owed since his business failed in 2005 with no sign of being resolved in the near \nfuture. I am not confident he will repay his delinquent debts because of his insufficient \ntrack record of financial progress over the last five years.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n  \n  \nI note Applicant is gainfully employed as a limousine driver and is supporting a \nwife and four children. Apart from the SOR debts, he appears current on his day-to-day \nexpenses. The whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nsignificant. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay or resolve his just debts over the past five years \nwas not prudent or responsible. He has a history of financial problems. His debts are \nsignificant and ongoing.  \n      \n \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nIn short, Applicant has not demonstrated a meaningful track record of repayment \nor a good-faith effort to resolve these debts. While Applicant\u2019s circumstances deserve \nconsideration, the record is void of any affirmative action on his part to mitigate these \ndebts.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors,\u201d4 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. I conclude \nhe has not shown sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible \nfor access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On December 8, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on January 2, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on March 2, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 11, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for April 2, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented six\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant presented eight\nexhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H.  He also testified on his own\nbehalf.  The record remained open until close of business on April 13, 2009, to allow the\nApplicant to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted four Post-\nHearing Exhibits, referred to as Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 4.  The official\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on April 14, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\n\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 48 years old, and has a Master\u2019s\nDegree in Business Administration.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nSenior Program Quality Engineer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated December 8, 2007, September 23,\n2008 and February 20, 2009, collectively reflect each of the delinquent debts set forth in\nthe SOR.  These reports indicate that the Applicant is currently indebted to at least five\nof the six creditors listed in the SOR for an amount totaling approximately $78,000.00.\n(Government Exhibits 2, 4 and 5).  \nFrom March 1995 to March 1998, Applicant attended a university and obtained\nhis Bachelor\u2019s Degree.  From September 1999 to December 2001, he attended\ngraduate school at another university and received his Master\u2019s Degree.\nIn May 1989, the Applicant was employed for a state agency, when he sustained\nan injury that resulted in him ultimately retiring on disability in 1991.  While on retirement\nand waiting the process of Workers Compensation, he chose to go back to school.  He\ntook out student loans in order to pay for his education.  He is currently indebted to the\nDepartment of Education for two delinquent accounts, one in the amount of\napproximately $26,780.00, and the other in the amount of $37,865.00, both referred for\ncollection in September 2007.  Applicant testified that when he incurred the student\nloans, he believed that they would be paid through workers compensation with the\nDepartment of Rehabilitation.  \nIn 1999, Applicant hired a law firm to represent him in his workers compensation\nclaim.  Applicant has undergone a number of surgeries as a result of his work related\ninjury.  The most recent surgery occurred in October 2008.  A letter from his attorney\nindicates that one of the issues that will be addressed in his workers compensation case\nis reimbursement of his prior schooling with regard to his past vocational rehabilitation\nplan.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 4).  There is no evidence in the record that the\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s vocational rehabilitation plan included paying for his undergraduate and/or\nmasters degree.  As of this date, there is no evidence that the Applicant\u2019s workers\ncompensation case will be successful. \nThe Applicant became indebted to each of the creditors set forth in the SOR.\nRecently, he has paid off two of the smaller debts.  A debt to a creditor in the amount of\n$984.00 was paid on February 13, 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  A debt owed to a\ncreditor in the amount of $169.00 was paid on April 6, 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Post Hearing\nExhibit 5).  Two other debts owed to a creditor in the amounts of $3,4374.00, and\n$8,733.00 are currently being consolidated for payment.  At the hearing, the Applicant\ntestified that he was going to pay $9,600.00 toward those debts and believes that he will\nowe a remainder of approximately $2,500.00.  (Tr. p. 42 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C and\nD).\nIn July 2006, the Applicant began working for his current employer.  Six months\nago, the Applicant began a loan rehabilitation program to address his student loans.\nPresently, he has made six payments of approximately $165.00 per month toward one\nof his student loans.  In regard to his other student loan, he has made two payments of\n$960.00.  He will need to make eight more payments of $960.00 before this loan will be\neligible for consolidation.  He hopes to have both loans consolidated so that he can set\nup a permanent payment plan and start resolving the debt.   \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal for 2008 was favorable as it reflects that he\nhas been a diligent and loyal employee who has provided exceptional support to the ITP\norganization.  Among other attributes, he is considered trustworthy and reliable.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H).   \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s manager, a neighbor, and s\nfriend attest to his honesty, high moral character, loyalty, trustworthiness,\nrespectfulness, conscientiousness and overall ability to always follow rules and\nregulations required on the job.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 3 and 4).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct \nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanant behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\n\n5\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nApplicant is indebted to at least two separate creditors, for four accounts in the\namount in excess of approximately $65,000.00.  Admittedly, circumstances beyond his\ncontrol are partially responsible for his financial demise.  His injury in 1988, followed by\nhis disability in 1991,  adversely effected his financial situation.  However, his decision\nto take out student loans to pay for his advanced education raises another issue.  The\nevidence in the record does not indicate that the Applicant\u2019s student loans were to be\npaid by the Department of Rehabilitation through his workers compensation claim.\nAlmost twenty years has passed since the Applicant started his workers compensation\nclaim, and he has still not resolved his delinquent student loans.  This is a good\nindication that he will not be successful with this case.  \nRecently, the Applicant has decided to take responsibility for his delinquent debts\nand is commended for this decision.  However, he has done too little, too late.  Given\nthe extent of his indebtedness, it is too early to determine if he will be successful with\nfollowing through with his intended payment plan and ultimately resolving his debts.  A\npromise to take remedial measures in the future is not evidence of reform and\nrehabilitation.  Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record to demonstrate that he\ncan even afford to make regular monthly payments, once they are arrived at, in addition\nto paying his regular monthly expenses.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant\n\n6\nhas not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is\nsufficient to overcome the Government's case.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply.  Arguably, Mitigating Condition 20(b) the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances also\napplies.  However, this mitigating condition is outweighed by the extent of the debt that\nremains outstanding, and Applicant\u2019s lack of action to resolve it.  Only recently has he\ndone anything to resolve the debts.  Despite his efforts, his financial problems remain\ncurrent and they are not isolated.  He has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to\nrepay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.  There is insufficient\nevidence of financial rehabilitation at this time. Accordingly, I find against the Applicant\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: [Applicant\u2019s father], Personal Representative \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 14, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 17, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 26, 2009, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 19, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, called one \nwitness, and submitted Exhibit (AE) A, which was received without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 27, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She attended \ncollege for a period but did not obtain a degree. She is married with two children, ages \nten and seven.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $9,601. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e \nconsist of five medical debts totaling $472. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a debt to a collection \ncompany for $9,129. Applicant admitted all the allegations in her response to the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband served in the United States Army. There is no indication of \nany financial difficulties before he was discharged in 2000. He was unemployed for an \nextended period and certain bills went unpaid. The debt of $9,129 is to a collection \ncompany, collecting what was originally a credit card debt. The balance on the account \nwas about $4,500 when Applicant stopped making payments in 2000. Her husband \nrejoined the Army in 2001, and their finances stabilized. She paid several accounts that \nwere delinquent. She contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f after her husband was back in \nthe Army about paying the debt. The company wanted half of the debt paid up front and \nthe remainder paid in three monthly payments. It was unwilling to accept any other \npayment arrangements. Applicant and her husband could not afford that much money in \nsuch a short period and did not pay the account. She has not heard from the creditor in \nmany years. The debt is no longer listed on her credit report. She believes the account \nis uncollectable because of the statute of limitations and is hesitant to contact the \ncreditor because it could revive the debt and open her to a lawsuit.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s believes the five medical debts should have been paid through her \nhusband\u2019s military medical insurance, TRICARE. TRICARE has different plans. Her \nfamily had TRICARE Prime, the plan that has the least flexibility to obtain health care \nproviders, but normally incurs the least out-of-pocket costs. She stated that she never \nreceived any medical bills that were not paid. She learned about the debts when she \ntook her child to the hospital and they told her that she had open accounts. She \nrequested an accounting of the debts, but the hospital refused to provide it to her, citing \nprivacy concerns. She even received a $250 refund from an overpayment she made on \nanother bill. She was perplexed as to why the hospital sent her a refund if the hospital \nbelieved she owed on her accounts. She is willing to pay the debts if they are her \nresponsibility, but will not pay them until she is provided a detailed accounting of the \ndebts.3  \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 18; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 16-18, 21-23, 30-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4.  \n \n3 Tr. at 14-16, 19, 23-24, 28-30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was medically discharged from the Army in 2006. He has \nbeen steadily employed since then. Applicant was a stay-at-home mother for about two \nyears from about late 2003 through 2005. She has had constant employment since she \nreturned to the workforce. She has worked for her current employer since the summer \nof 2007. Applicant has not received financial counseling. Other than what is reflected in \nthe SOR, she has no delinquent debts. Her family\u2019s current financial situation is sound. \nThey are able to pay their debts and expenses with some extra at the end of the \nmonth.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor wrote that her job performance is excellent and her \ncharacter is that of an honest, dedicated, and hard working person. He recommends her \nfor a security clearance.5  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 19-21, 24-28; GE 1-4. \n \n5 AE A. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay her obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n5 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started in 2000, when her husband was \ndischarged from the military and was unemployed for an extended period. Their \nfinances stabilized after her husband returned to the military a year later. She paid \nseveral debts, but the creditor for the large credit card debt refused to accept any \npayment arrangements other than half immediately and the rest in three monthly \npayments. She could not afford those arrangements and did not pay the debt. It has \nsince dropped off her credit report. She is reluctant to pursue further negotiations with \nthe creditor for fear that it would revive the debt from being barred by the statute of \nlimitations and open her to a lawsuit. Applicant credibly testified that she never received \nmedical bills that went unpaid, and that she would pay the medical debts if the hospital \nresponded to her request to provide a full accounting of the debts. Her finances are \ncurrently in good shape. She and her husband are both employed. They are not \naccruing new delinquent debt, and they have money left over at the end of the month. \nHer testimony about the medical debts was credible. The amount of her medical debt is \ninsufficient to raise any real security concerns. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not completely applicable even if the credit card debt is \nuncollectable because Applicant acknowledged she owed the debt and it has never \nbeen paid. The medical debts have also not been completely resolved. Her husband\u2019s \nunemployment qualifies as a condition that was largely beyond her control. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nalso requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant paid \nsome debts after her husband rejoined the military. She could not make the payments \nthat the credit card required and that debt was never paid. She never went back and \nattempted to renegotiate payments with the creditor, which would have been the \nresponsible action under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially applicable. That debt \nis no longer listed on her credit report and Applicant believes it is barred by the statute \nof limitations. However, Applicant does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(d) for \n\n \n6 \n \nrelying on the statute of limitations as a defense to paying the debt.6 She has not \nreceived financial counseling. However, she and her husband are now financially \nsolvent. Her financial problems are being resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is \npartially applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a \n31-year-old mother of two who encountered financial difficulties in 2000, when her \nhusband was discharged from the Army and could not find employment. He rejoined the \nArmy in 2001, and their finances stabilized. They paid several debts, and with the \nexception of the relatively small medical debts, she has not accrued new delinquent \n                                                          \n6 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No.  99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n7 \n \ndebts. The credit card debt in issue was accrued up through 2000, when Applicant was \nin her early twenties. As discussed above, relying on the statute of limitations is not \nbeing completely responsible. However, if the debt is uncollectible, the risk of her having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds and her potential vulnerability to financial \ninducements are greatly reduced. The creditor is no longer pursuing her for this debt. At \nsome point, it no longer indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations. She has reached that point in time.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns\nregarding Applicant arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated January, 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn March 13, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR. He admitted the factual\nallegations under the financial guideline. He requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request and assigned me to the case on\nJune 2, 2009. Applicant and Department Counsel agreed to a July 7, 2009, hearing\ndate. On June 11, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for that\nJuly 17, 2009\n\n2\ndate. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted four\nexhibits (GE) 1-4, without objection. Applicant introduced four exhibits (AE) A-D, without\nobjection. He testified on his own behalf and presented the testimony of two witnesses.\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on July 15, 2009. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for a public trust position is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old working for a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1984 and entered the workforce. He is single and has no children. He\nhas worked for his current employer since November 2007 (Tr. 24).\nPrior to his current employment, Applicant worked at a variety of jobs, often\nearning low hourly rates of pay. He was unemployed for a few months in 2004. He also\nhad a job in 2005-2007 that was seasonal (Tr. 41). He estimates that he earned\napproximately $12,000 to $14,000 a year. His current salary is $25,000 (Tr. 25).\nAt issue are the following debts totaling approximately $19,856, as noted in the\nMarch 2, 2009 SOR as allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d.\n1.a \u2013 Bank Debt ($3,191) \u2013 PAID \u2013 Applicant admits this account represents a credit\ncard account opened in 1997. In 2003 or 2004, he could not make payments on the\naccount due to high interest rates and his net income (Tr. 31). He settled this account\nfor $1,800 in April 2009 (AE B).\n1.b \u2013 Financial Loan ($9,269) \u2013 PAID \u2013 Applicant settled this account for $2,317 in\nJune 2009 (AE C). He did not make any payments on this account after 2004 due to\nunemployment (Tr. 32). \n1.c \u2013 Financial Loan ($6,775) \u2013 PAID \u2013 Applicant admits this allegation. This is a\nduplicate account that was listed on his credit report (AE C). He settled this account as\nreferenced in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b above.  \n1.d \u2013 Cable Debt ($621) \u2013 PAID \u2013 Applicant settled this account but originally disputed\nit because he alerted the company to change the account name to his former\nroommate.\nApplicant obtained the services of a consumer credit counseling service in 2009.\nHe completed two financial courses in June 2009 (AE D). Prior to that he researched\nvarious debt management companies and determined that it was not in his best\ninterests to use such a company. He decided to save money in 2008 and pay his debts\nin 2009. He prepared a budget. He is keeping receipts for his purchases. He does not\nuse a credit card (Tr. 27). He just recently made his last car payment for his 1997\nvehicle (Tr. 22). He estimates a net monthly remainder of $250. He also has a savings\naccount. He is current on his monthly expenses (Tr. 40).\n\n3\nApplicant acknowledged that he has responsibility for his delinquent debts. He\nstates that he did not pay sufficient attention to the accounts. He used credit cards to\npay for groceries but also some frivolous things (Tr. 43). He tried to transfer his debt to\na credit card with a lower interest rate but he still could not handle the monthly amounts\n(Tr. 43). He now realizes the importance of his credit standing. \nApplicant\u2019s manager testified at the hearing that he is a dedicated, hardworking\nindividual. He is a team lead at the help desk (Tr. 47). She describes his prior\nexperience in working with the public and with personal information. He is responsible\nin the community and assists with a charity run. He collects money for the run and has\nproven to be trustworthy. She recommends him for a public trust position.\nApplicant\u2019s former roommate testified at the hearing and confirmed Applicant\u2019s\nproblem with the cable account. He described Applicant as a \u201ctrue friend\u201d who is honest\nand dependable. He has known Applicant for many years. He stated that Applicant has\nhelped him financially in the past (Tr. 53).\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt, mostly in 2004.\nHe acknowledged the accounts represented old debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\n\n5\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Most of Applicant=s debts became delinquent around the time of his 2004\nshort period of unemployment. However, he was unwilling to pay his debts after he\nbecame employed. His debts have only recently been resolved. Consequently, this\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Inasmuch as the\nmajority of debts at issue became delinquent during Applicant\u2019s period of\nunemployment or shortly thereafter, this mitigating condition applies and is a factor for\nconsideration. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant received financial counseling and\nhas resolved his debt. He saved his money in 2008 and settled all his accounts in 2009,\nand provided documentation at the hearing to substantiate his claims. Therefore, AG &\n20(d), Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,@ applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nbegan working after high school. He did not earn a great sum of money in his positions.\nHe opened credit accounts in 1997, but was not able to continue to make payments on\nthe accounts after 2004. The accounts were opened in 1997. The debts appeared on\nhis credit report for a number of years. He now has obtained a position that pays a\ngreater sum of money. He is doing well in his job.  He saved his money and paid his\ndebts in 2009. He has no current debt. He uses cash for all purchases. He has no credit\n\n6\ncards. He accepts responsibility for his actions. He is now better equipped to handle his\nfinancial affairs due to some financial counseling. He is aware that his past actions\ncaused his financial problems and he does not want to be in such a situation again. \nOverall, the record evidence does not leave me with questions or doubts with\nregard to Applicant\u2019s financial condition. As noted above, AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will\nbe resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Consequently, I conclude Applicant met his\nburden and mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his finances. Access is\ngranted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\n_____________________________\nNOREEN A LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Greg D. McCormack, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence) arising from Applicant\u2019s family and personal ties to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 11, 2008. On \nSeptember 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nDecember 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 18, 2008, and requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing. On January 26, 2009, she requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge (Hearing Exhibit (HX) II). (HX I is discussed \nbelow.) Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 18, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to an administrative judge on June 19, 2009. The case was reassigned to me \non July 31, 2009, based on workload. The case was tentatively scheduled for \nSeptember 3, 2009, but was postponed due to the unavailability of Applicant\u2019s counsel. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 2, 2009, scheduling the hearing for \nSeptember 23, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) \n1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted without objection. I kept the \nrecord open until October 2, 2009, to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary \nevidence. She timely submitted AX G and H. Department Counsel\u2019s comments \nregarding AX G and H are attached to the record as HX III. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 1, 2009. The record closed on October 2, 2009. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request to take administrative notice of relevant \nfacts about the PRC. The request and its enclosures were not admitted in evidence but \nare attached to the record as HX I. The facts administratively noticed are set out below \nin my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.i, and offered explanations. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old senior system analyst employed by a federal \ncontractor. She has worked for her current employer since March 2007. She previously \nworked for other federal contractors from February 1998 to April 1999 and from June \n2004 to February 2007. She previously received a favorable trustworthiness \ndetermination in June 2004 (GX 1 at 27; Tr. 80), but she has never held a security \nclearance (Tr. 6). \n \n \nApplicant was born in the PRC. When she was one year old, her parents were \nsent to separate labor camps. Applicant lived with her mother in a labor camp for about \nfour years (Tr. 32-33).  \n \nApplicant obtained her undergraduate college degree in the PRC and then \nworked in the textile industry (Tr. 64). She was married in May 1982. She and her \nhusband were involved in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989 (Tr. 45). They \ncame to the U.S. in 1990. They left the PRC primarily because of their experience at \nTiananmen Square. Applicant\u2019s husband entered the U.S. on a student visa, and she \nfollowed him as a visiting family member (Tr. 63). She attended a U.S. university from \n\n \n3 \n \n \nMay 1992 to May 1995 and obtained two master\u2019s degrees, one in physics and one in \nengineering (Tr. 48-49).  \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in December 2003 (AX A-1). She obtained a \nU.S. passport in July 2005 (AX G). She did not use her PRC passport after becoming a \nU.S. citizen (Tr. 48). Her husband became a U.S. citizen in July 2007, and he is \nemployed by a defense contractor (Tr. 50). They have a 25-year-old daughter who \nattends medical school in the U.S. and is engaged to marry a U.S. citizen (Tr. 78).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is deceased, and her father-in-law has been a \npermanent resident of the U.S. since January 2009 (Tr. 63; AX A-2). Her husband\u2019s \nbrother is a citizen and resident of Canada (Tr. 43).  \n \nApplicant traveled to the PRC to visit her parents in 2001, before she became a \nU.S. citizen. She traveled to the PRC again for 16 days in June 2006 with a tour \narranged by a U.S. travel agency (GX 1 at 22; AX G at 6; Tr. 79). She stayed in a hotel \nwith the tour group, even though her parents were still living in the PRC, because she \nwas working for a defense contractor and she wanted to avoid having to register with \nthe local police (Tr. 79-80). She filed the required trip reports with her employer (Tr. 81).  \n \nWhen Applicant applied for a visa to visit the PRC, the PRC embassy requested \nthat she produce her PRC passport, which had expired on January 6, 2005. The PRC \nembassy cancelled her passport and placed a visa stamp on her U.S. passport (AX H; \nTr. 70). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents came to the U.S. in October 2007 and became permanent \nresidents of the U.S. (Answer at 1; AX A-3; AX A-4). They returned to the PRC in 2008 \nbecause her mother had osteoporosis, had not lived in the U.S. long enough to qualify \nfor Medicare, and could not afford the medicine and treatment she needed. The \nmedicine and treatment were affordable in the PRC. While in the PRC, they helped her \nfather-in-law apply for permanent residence in the U.S. (Tr. 36, 76). They returned to \nthe U.S. in January 2009, and her father-in-law came with them (Tr. 37). \n \n \nBefore coming to the U.S., Applicant\u2019s father had a clerical job with a \nconstruction company. Her mother was a bookkeeper with the same company. Neither \nparent was associated with the PRC government or the military (Tr. 61-62). Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law was a retired teacher before coming to the U.S. Her mother-in-law was a \nschool nurse before she died (Tr. 63). Her father, mother, and father-in-law receive \nsmall pensions from the PRC, each receiving about $200 a month (Tr. 85).  \n \n \nApplicant denied having contact once a year with a friend in the PRC, as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h. She testified that she previously maintained once-a-year contact with a \nneighbor who had cared for her daughter, but she stopped contacting her three or four \nyears ago because her security training made her aware of the risks involved in \nmaintaining contact with a citizen and resident of the PRC (Tr. 82-83). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger sister is the only member of her immediate family residing in \nthe PRC. In 2000 or 2001, her sister was imprisoned for one year because of her \nreligious beliefs (Tr. 35). Applicant sponsored her sister for an immigrant visa in April \n2004 (AX A-5). In September 2009, Applicant\u2019s sister was notified by the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services that her application was still being processed (AX \nA-6). Her sister is an engineer employed by an information technology company in the \nPRC that is engaged in a joint venture with a U.S. company (AX A-7; Tr. 84).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister lived with her grandmother as a young child (Tr. 87). Because \nApplicant and her sister spent most of their lives apart, they never became close (Tr. \n87-89). After Applicant came to the U.S., she did not talk to her sister for about ten \nyears (Tr. 89). At the time of the hearing, it had been a \u201cfew months\u201d since their last \ncontact, and the call was initiated by her father to update her sister on the status of her \nvisa request (Tr. 83-84). Applicant has not told her sister anything about her job (Tr. 86). \n \nApplicant and her husband purchased a home in the U.S. in 2002 (Tr. 30). They \npaid off the mortgage on the home in September 2009 (AX B-1). She lives in the home \nwith her husband, her parents, and her father-in-law (Tr. 30-31). Applicant and her \nhusband have fully paid for their three cars (Tr. 53). They have more than $270,000 in \nbank accounts, retirement accounts, and investments (AX B-2 through B-9). They have \nno financial interests in the PRC (Tr. 53).  \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by her employer and has received numerous \ncertificates recognizing her contributions to the company (AX D-2 through D-5). She has \ncompleted several courses to enhance her managerial skills and security awareness \n(AX E-1 through E-11). \n \nA former supervisor who has known Applicant for more than eight years \nconsiders her capable, dedicated, and a person of exceptional character (AX F-1). \nAnother supervisor for whom Applicant worked for four years describes her as one who \n\u201calways went the extra mile\u201d to carry out her responsibilities (AX F-2). A coworker who \nhas become a personal friend describes her as a \u201cmodel employee\u201d with exceptional \ntechnical and organizational skills, an informal mentor for other employees, and very \ndependable (AX F-3). A former coworker for five years attended her hearing to provide \nmoral support and submitted a statement attesting to her trustworthiness and loyalty to \nthe U.S. (AX F-4). Another former coworker commented on her thoughtfulness toward \nothers and her dedication (AX F-5). Two other coworkers were impressed with her \ndedication, technical knowledge, strong character, and reaction to adversity and \ndifficulty (AX F6 and F-8). A former college classmate who is now a family friend \nconsiders Applicant very trustworthy, focused, and committed to excellence. Her \nclassmate noted that Applicant is usually very reserved, but she is strong when \nconfronted with adversity (AX F-7).  \n \nApplicant testified she has no loyalty to the PRC and that she is \u201cone hundred \npercent loyal to the United States.\u201d Her experience with PRC repression has made an \nindelible impression on her. She testified, \u201cI consider the United States my country, and \n\n \n5 \n \n \nif my country is not safe, my home is not safe.\u201d She concluded her testimony by \nexpressing her gratitude to the U.S, referring to it as \u201cthe safest place in the world,\u201d and \nvowing to bring all of her family to the U.S. (Tr. 54-55, 89). \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts. The PRC is a large and \neconomically powerful country, with a population of over a billion people and an \neconomy growing at about ten percent per year. It has an authoritarian government \ndominated by the Communist Party. It has large and increasingly sophisticated military \nforces. The U.S. and the PRC have been rivals since the Cold War, with particular \ndisagreement on the status of Taiwan. Despite political disagreements, the U.S. and the \nPRC have become major economic and trading partners, and have cooperated on law \nenforcement matters, threats posed by the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran, \nand transnational health threats.  \n \nI have also taken administrative notice that the PRC aggressively targets \nsensitive and protected U.S. technology and military information, using worldwide \nintelligence operations. It exerts pressure on foreign companies, including those in the \nU.S., to transfer technology to companies in the PRC as part of doing business in the \nPRC. It is one of the most aggressive practitioners of industrial espionage in the world. \nU.S. citizens of PRC ancestry are considered prime intelligence targets.   \n \n \nFinally, I have taken administrative notice that the PRC has a poor human rights \nrecord. It suppresses political dissent, and it practices arbitrary arrest and detention, \nforced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. Travelers to the PRC can \nexpect to be placed under surveillance, with their hotel rooms, telephones, and fax \nmachines monitored and personal possessions, including computers, searched without \ntheir knowledge or consent. Because the PRC does not recognize dual citizenship, it \nmay not afford naturalized U.S. citizens of PRC ancestry the consular protections to \nwhich they are entitled.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s parents, sister, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of the PRC (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e); her spouse is a \ncitizen of the PRC residing in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.b); she has contact with family \nmembers in the PRC about once a week (SOR \u00b6 1.g); she has a friend who is a citizen \nand resident of the PRC, with whom she has contact about once a year (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n1.h); and she traveled to the PRC in December 2000 and June 2005 to visit family \nmembers (SOR \u00b6 1.i).  \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nFour disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(d): sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(i): conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (d) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, \n2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In light of the PRC\u2019s repressive and \nauthoritarian government and its track record of targeting the U.S. for sensitive \ninformation, Applicant has a very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security \nconcerns arising from her ties to the PRC. \n \n \nThe totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2003). Applicant\u2019s parents live with her in the U.S., but they are citizens of the PRC \nand receive small pensions from the PRC. They recently returned temporarily to the \nPRC to take advantage of low-cost medical care. Her sister is a citizen and resident of \nthe PRC who has been imprisoned for her religious views. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law also \nis a citizen of the PRC, but he resides in the U.S. A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of \nthe person's spouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 20, 2002). Applicant has not rebutted that presumption with respect to her father-\nin-law. I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are raised. \n \n \nApplicant has rebutted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b that her spouse is a citizen of \nthe PRC. He is now a U.S. citizen, his mother is deceased, his father is a U.S. resident, \nand his brother is a citizen and resident of Canada. She has also rebutted the allegation \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e that her brother-in-law is a citizen of the PRC. Her brother-in-law and his \nspouse are citizens and residents of Canada. Based on this evidence, I conclude AG \u00b6 \n7(d) is not raised. \n \n \nApplicant admitted maintaining once-a-year social contact with a former neighbor \nand babysitter (alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h) until about three years ago, but she terminated \nthat contact when she became aware that it might raise security concerns. I conclude \nshe has rebutted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to the PRC in December 2000 was solely to visit her family, \nwho then resided in the PRC. This trip has no independent security significance. See \nISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). However, her travel to the PRC in \nJune 2005 appears to have been for pleasure as well as to visit her family. It occurred \n\n \n9 \n \n \nshortly after her PRC passport was cancelled and her U.S. passport was stamped with \na PRC entry visa, and while she was employed by a U.S. government contractor. These \ncircumstances made her vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion, thereby \nraising AG \u00b6 7(i).  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(i), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely that individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant\u2019s family history and the nature of the PRC government \nnegate application of this mitigating condition. Her sister is a known dissident who has \nbeen imprisoned by the PRC for her views. Applicant\u2019s parents continue to receive \nsmall pensions from the PRC government, and they have sought low-cost medical care \nin the PRC. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family \nmembers could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family \nmembers were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1. The Appeal \nBoard consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that an applicant \nshould not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to make a choice between \nthe interests of the family member and the interests of the U.S. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not permitted \nto apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the new \nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if \nan applicant \u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant and her family have firsthand experience with repression in the PRC. \nShe and her husband left the PRC mainly because of their experiences in that \nrepressive environment. All of her husband\u2019s immediate family and all her immediate \nfamily, except her sister, have left the PRC. Applicant has worked for U.S. government \n\n \n10 \n \n \ncontractors for many years. She has established strong ties to the U.S. and feels no \nloyalty to the PRC government. Her husband is a U.S. citizen and is also employed by a \nU.S. government contractor. Applicant and her husband are financially secure, making \nthe significance of her parents\u2019 small pensions minimal.  \n \nApplicant has a reputation for being strong in the face of adversity. Her sister has \nchallenged the PRC government in the past, demonstrating that she, like Applicant, is \nnot easily intimidated or influenced.  \n \nApplicant has not divulged the nature of her work to her family members. She \nhas demonstrated that she is very security conscious. I am confident that she would \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is \nestablished.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \nApplicant has not overcome this presumption. Although Applicant has had minimal \ndirect contact with her sister, she has demonstrated her sense of obligation to her sister \nby sponsoring her application for admission to the U.S. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(c) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by foreign travel may be mitigated if it was \u201capproved by \nthe cognizant security authority.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). Although Applicant\u2019s travel to the PRC in \nJune 2005 raises security concerns, the evidence reflects that she properly reported her \ntravel to her employer, and she stayed in a hotel instead of her parents\u2019 home to avoid \nthe requirement to register with local police. There is no evidence of any attempts by the \nPRC to exploit her while she was in the PRC. I conclude she has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by this travel. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n11 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant was soft-spoken and reserved at the hearing, but her testimony was \nvery direct, sincere, candid, and credible. Although she does not have a clearance, she \nis very security conscious, as demonstrated by her decision to terminate contact with a \nformer neighbor in the PRC, her decision to stay in a hotel instead of her parents\u2019 home \nwhen she visited the PRC in June 2005, and her compliance with her employer\u2019s \nreporting requirements for foreign travel. She has a reputation and a track record of \nconfronting adversity rather than succumbing to it. She has spent much of her life in \ngovernment service. She does not work in the private sector, where the pressure to \ntrade information for market access in the PRC would be stronger. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude she \nhas carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:  \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \ngranted. \n \nOn March 22, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 18, 2011, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2011. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 6, 2011, scheduling the hearing for June 23, \n\n \n2 \n \n \n2011. Applicant submitted a request for a continuance and, based upon good cause, \nthe continuance was granted. On June 20, 2011, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nscheduling the hearing for July 13, 2011. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Applicant did not object and they were \nadmitted. The Government requested administrative notice be taken of certain facts \nrelating to China as contained in GE 5. Applicant had no objection and I took \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in GE 5. Applicant testified on his own behalf \nand presented Exhibits (AE) A through H, which were admitted without objections. The \nrecord was left open for receipt of additional documentation. On July 24, 2011, \nApplicant presented a post-hearing submission, marked AE I; and on July 27, 2011, \nApplicant presented a second post-hearing submission, marked AE J. Department \nCounsel had no objections to AE I or AE J, and they were admitted into the record. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 21, 2011.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, that Applicant\u2019s friend and \nbusiness associate resides in the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) and is a citizen of \nCanada (1.a); that Applicant owns a corporation that has a business agreement with a \ncompany in China to sell its product within China (1.b); that another of Applicant\u2019s \ncompanies has an agreement to purchase raw materials from a company in China (1.c); \nand that Applicant maintains a bank account in China valued at $9,000 (1.d). Applicant \ndenied all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He works as a \ncomputer programmer. He has worked as a government contractor since 2006. In \naddition to his work as a government contractor, he has owned several small \nbusinesses. (GE 1; Tr. 27-28.) \n \nApplicant was born in China in 1965. His father, like many Chinese scholars, was \nimprisoned by the Chinese government during the height of the Chinese Cultural \nRevolution. Applicant, in a letter to the court, described how his family was harassed \nand socially outcast from Chinese society. (GE 1; AE J.) He recalled: \n \nI remember it clearly that day: they (the local Chinese government \nofficials) stormed into our home while my other was nursing my younger \nsister. I remember how the furniture was arranged in the apartment. They \nransacked our home turning over tiles on the floor in looking for evidence \nused against my father. My father did not come home that day. During the \nnext 2-3 years, we visited my father in the \u201cre-education camp.\u201d The \u201cre-\neducation camp\u201d was setup during the Chinese Cultural Revolution for \ndetaining and incarcerating those who were falsely accused as \u201cPeople\u2019s \nEnemies.\u201d (AE J.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was officially exonerated in the 1980\u2019s before his family left \nChina for the United States. In 1983, Applicant and his family immigrated to the U.S. He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in October 1989. He considers himself to be solely a citizen of \nthe U.S. He attended college in the U.S. (GE 1; AE J; Tr. 49-51.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family all live in the U.S. He is married to a citizen of \nSingapore. Together, they have two children who are solely U.S. citizens. His son is 19-\nyears old and is a freshman at a Big-Ten university. His daughter is 16-years old and in \nhigh school in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s mother and sister are also U.S. citizens and \nresidents. (GE 1; Tr. 27-29, 49-51.) \n \nApplicant has owned several businesses. In July 1995 Applicant incorporated a \nsub-chapter S Corporation (Corp. 1). The primary purpose of Corp. 1 was to develop \nand sell photo I.D. and security products. Applicant, through Corp. 1, created software \nthat helped create I.D. access cards. He sold his products to many customers, including \na privately held Chinese company (Foreign Company, hereafter FC) owned by the sister \nof Applicant\u2019s former high school classmate in China. FC sold Corp. 1\u2019s products in \nChina. In Applicant\u2019s December 2008 statement, he indicated that he believed Corp. 1 \nand FC had a written agreement for FC to represent and sell Corp. 1 products in China, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant testified at hearing that he was unable to locate a \ncopy of the agreement. From 1999 to 2006, Applicant took many short trips to China to \nmeet with FC. Corp. 1 ceased business operations in 2009, prior to filing bankruptcy. \nCorp. 1 filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2009. A letter from Corp. 1\u2019s \nbankruptcy attorney establishes that this corporation has ceased doing business. (GE 2; \nGE 3; GE 4; AE A; AE F; AE I; AE J; Tr. 28-39, 46, 52-60.) \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant formed a second corporation (Corp. 2). The purpose of \nCorp. 2 was to provide finger printing technologies to other businesses and to new \nparents. Corp. 2 was initially part of Corp. 1, but eventually became a separate entity, \nprior to Corp 1 filing bankruptcy. Corp. 2 sells finger printing packets to companies \naround the world. A sample of the product was entered into evidence. Corp. 2 acquires \nplastic cases and molding for its products from FC. FC offers the best prices on these \nparts. Applicant testified he does not have an ongoing contract or agreement with FC for \nthese supplies as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but orders them from FC as needed. (GE 2; GE \n3; GE 4; Tr. 39-48, 53-63, 71, 74-75.) \n \nApplicant is still in contact with his high school friend, who is the general \nmanager for FC, owned by the friend\u2019s sister. Applicant and his friend went to school \ntogether in China, prior to Applicant\u2019s immigration to the U.S. After the Tiananmen \nSquare protests in 1989, Applicant\u2019s friend immigrated to Canada and became a \nCanadian citizen. He is still a Canadian citizen, but returned to China in approximately \n1996 when it opened up economically. Applicant\u2019s friend was unable to master English \nand could only find work at restaurants in Canada. In China, he has been able to work \nat FC. Applicant has a close relationship with his friend and they would buy and sell \nproducts between one another when Applicant owned Corp. 1. Applicant still buys \nsupplies for Corp. 2 through his friend from FC, as noted above. He also exchanges \n\n \n4 \n \n \nemails, pictures of family, and phone calls regularly with his friend. He visits his friend \nwhen he travels to China. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 29-30, 32, 37-40, 48, 57-60, 71, 74-\n75.) \n \nApplicant has a bank account in China with a balance of approximately $9,000. \nApplicant uses this money during his travels in China. He testified that transactions in \nChina are cash based. He once got sick on a trip to China and needed to go to the \nhospital. He was expected to pay in cash. After that experience, he opened up an \naccount in China for his use when he is on travel. As indicated on Applicant\u2019s Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing, Applicant makes many short trips to \nChina each year. His last trip to China was in March 2011. The account is used solely \nfor personal use and is not connected with any business transactions. He testified that \nhe has assets totaling over one million dollars in the U.S. and provided documentation \non several of his investment accounts. Applicant has no investments or retirement \naccounts in China. (GE 1; GE 4; AE B-AE E; Tr. 33, 45-46, 66-68, 71.) \n \nApplicant is well respected by his friends, colleagues, and fellow church \nmembers who wrote letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Each letter attests to Applicant\u2019s \nstrong morals, honesty, and reliability. He votes in U.S. elections and is involved in \nvolunteering through his church community. He has no criminal background, as \nevidenced by a criminal background check Applicant introduced into evidence. (AE G; \nAE H; Tr. 70-71.) \n \nChina1 \n \nChina is a large and economically powerful country, and has a population of over \na billion people. It has an authoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese \nCommunist Party.  \n \nChina\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), which includes the army, navy, air force \nand strategic nuclear forces, is modernizing its forces. China has articulated roles for \nthe PLA that \u201cgo beyond China\u2019s immediate territorial interests.\u201d There is limited \ntransparency in China\u2019s military and security affairs that enhances uncertainty and \nincreases the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation. \n \nA 2009 Annual Report to Congress indicated that \u201cChina is the most aggressing \ncountry conducting espionage against the United States, focusing on obtaining U.S. \ninformation and technologies beneficial to China\u2019s military modernization and economic \ndevelopment.\u201d The Chinese Government rewards actions of private individuals who \nobtain technology on its behalf and it offers financial inducements to U.S. government \nofficials to encourage them to compromise classified information.  \n \nThe 2009 Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \nnoted the following about China's enterprise-directed industrial espionage:  \n \n                                                          \n1 All of the information about China is contained in GE 5.   \n\n \n5 \n \n \nEnterprise-directed espionage may also be growing in importance and taking \non less random and more targeted form. The 2008 unclassified report of the \nDefense Security Service cited a rise in efforts undertaken by commercial \nentities to target restricted technologies, speculating that this likely represents \n\"a purposeful attempt to make contacts seem more innocuous by using non-\ngovernmental entities as surrogate collectors for interested government or \ngovernment-affiliated entities. . .\u201d  \n \nChinese intelligence personnel are inclined to make use of sympathetic people \nwilling to act as a \"friend of China.\" While this most clearly has been seen in PRC-targeted \nrecruitment of Chinese-Americans, PRC agents also have used U.S. citizens of other ethnic \nbackgrounds as sources.  \n \nIn cases resulting in federal prosecutions during fiscal years 2007 and 2008, China \nwas ranked second only to Iran as the leading destination for illegal exports of restricted \nU.S. technology. China\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities are a threat to the \nsecurity of U.S. technology. Department Counsel\u2019s summary provides additional details \nof China\u2019s aggressive intelligence efforts directed towards acquiring U.S. secrets and \nproprietary technologies, as well as nine examples of criminal cases in 2007 to 2009 \ninvolving people and organizations connected to the PRC. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s long-time friend and business associate lives and works in China. \nApplicant has a long history of conducting business with this friend through Corp. 1 and \nCorp. 2. Applicant also has $9,000 in a bank account in China. However, the mere \npossession of close ties with a person or financial interests in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. It must also be shown that the \nforeign friend, business interest, or financial interest could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nMost nations with substantial military establishments seek classified and sensitive \ninformation from the United States because it has the largest military industrial complex \nand most advanced military establishment in the world. Chinese military officials could \nseek or accept classified information from U.S. citizens with access to this material. In \nfact, the administrative notice documents highlight several recent cases involving \nChina\u2019s attempts to collect proprietary information from U.S. sources. Applicant\u2019s \naccess to classified information and his connection to his friend and financial interest \ncould create a potential conflict of interest. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) apply.  \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits efforts to target U.S. protected information are relevant in assessing the likelihood \nthat an Applicant\u2019s friendship, bank account, and business dealings make him \npotentially vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or there is a serious \nproblem in the country with crime or terrorism. China is known to target U.S. \nintelligence.  \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s ties to the United States run deep. He immigrated \nto the U.S. after watching the persecution and \u201cre-education\u201d of his father at the hands \nof Chinese Communists. He attended college in the U.S., earning a bachelor\u2019s degree \nfrom an American university. His mother and sister are naturalized U.S. citizens. His \nchildren are both U.S. citizens and attend American schools. He is active in his \ncommunity and his church. He votes in U.S. elections.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties to China are limited. Applicant admittedly has close ties to his \nfriend in China. They communicate frequently and Applicant orders parts for Corp. 2 \nthrough this friend. Thus \u00b6 8(c) is not mitigating in the instant case. However, aside from \nthis one friendship and business connections through this friend, Applicant\u2019s ties to \nChina are insignificant. Applicant has no assets in China, expect for the $9,000 bank \naccount for emergencies when he is traveling in China. His bank account in China is \nminimal when compared to the over one million dollars in assets he possesses in the \nU.S. \n \nI have had the opportunity observe Applicant, listen and consider his testimony, \nexamine the evidence and resolve any questions. I find that, although Applicant has a \nfriend in China and business ties to China, he has a deep and longstanding relationship \nwith the United States. His life and that of his immediate family is entrenched in the \nUnited States. I find his connections to the United States are stronger than his \nconnection to China. His memories of the Chinese government ransacking his home \nand imprisoning his father are still fresh in his mind. His loyalty to the United States is \nsteadfast and undivided and he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. The value and routine nature of buying parts for his finger \nprinting kits from China are unlikely to result in any conflict and could not be used to \ninfluence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant has been in the United States since 1983. He has no family in China, \nnor does he have fond feelings for China after the imprisonment of his father. Applicant \nhas one friend, with whom he does business in China, and a bank account with $9,000. \nHe no longer has any type of written agreement with the FC after Corp. 1 ceased \noperations in 2009. He only buys parts from FC for Corp. 2 because FC produces the \nmost affordable parts. The purchases for Corp. 2 are done through purchase orders on \nan as needed basis. There is no outstanding agreement binding Applicant to future \npurchases.  \n \nApplicant raised his children in the U.S. and is active in his community and \nchurch. His references reflect that Applicant is an honest and trustworthy individual. I \nhave carefully considered all of the evidence and I am convinced Applicant\u2019s roots are \nfirmly planted in the United States. I am also convinced that should there ever be a \nconflict of interest, Applicant would clearly resolve it in favor of this country due to his \nsteadfast commitment to the United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nForeign Influence.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 17, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On November 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under \nGuidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and G (Alcohol Consumption), and detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApril 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 5, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated December 19, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department \nCounsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on February 5, 2009, and \nthe case was assigned to me on February 6, 2009. A Notice of Hearing was issued on \nMarch 5, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 24, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, five Government exhibits were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, but offered no exhibits. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \nwas received on March 31, 2009. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nAt the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case, Department Counsel moved to \namend the SOR & 1.b. to conform to the evidence presented.  There being no objection, \nthe motion was granted.1 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the factual allegations in \nthe SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 2.a., and 1.b.).  He denied the one remaining allegation.  \n \nApplicant is a 21-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nretain the SECRET security clearance which was granted to him in about June or July \n2006.2 Applicant has never been married.3 He has been gainfully employed by the \nsame defense contractor since January 2006, and currently serves as a building \nsupport specialist.4 His employment history since 2003 includes various periods of \n \n1 Tr. at 16-18. \n \n2 Id. at 22. \n \n3 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated January 17, 2006), at 16. \n \n4 Tr. at 21. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nunemployment (October 2003-August 2004, August 2004-July 2005, and December \n2005-January 2006).5  \n \nCriminal Conduct & Alcohol Consumption  \n \nApplicant is an alcohol abuser. He was a frequent consumer of alcohol from the \ntime he was about 15 or 16, while in high school.6 He initially drank beer and/or hard \nliquor with older friends, once or twice a month, generally at their homes or at his \nhome.7 On the occasions when he drank at the home of friends, he would remain there \novernight.8 Once or twice a year, his parents would catch him drinking and they would \nground him.9 Over time, Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption increased in both frequency \nand quantity. Frequency-wise, it increased to three times per month.10 Quantity-wise, it \nincreased from four or five beers (enough to get him drunk),11 to five to seven beers.12  \nIn May 2005, Applicant graduated from high school, and his drinking habits remained \nunchanged.13 \n \nApplicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol resulted in at least one incident involving law \nenforcement authorities. In November 2007, when he was 20 years old, after having \nThanksgiving dinner with his parents, Applicant drove to a friend\u2019s house for an evening \nof drinking with four or five other underage drinkers.14 Over the next four hours, he \nestimated he consumed either approximately 80 ounces of beer15 or two to three pints \nof beer.16 At some point, Applicant decided to return home.  While he remembers being \nslightly impaired,17 he did not feel he was intoxicated.18 While driving home, his \n \n5 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 3, at 12-15. \n \n6 Tr. at 22-23. \n \n7 Id. at 23-24. \n \n8 Id. \n \n9 Id. at 26. \n \n10 Id. \n \n11 Id. at 23. \n \n12 Id. at 26. \n \n13 Id. at 27-28. \n \n14 Id. at 31-32. \n \n15 Id. at 33. During the hearing Applicant estimated his consumption was two 40-ounce bottles of beer.

Count 1 was dismissed by the prosecutor, count 3 was dismissed \nby the court, and Applicant was, upon his plea, convicted of count 2.26 He was \nsentenced to one day in jail, fined $1,800, his license was suspended, and he was \nordered to attend traffic school, participate in counseling, and required to have a \nbreathalyzer ignition system installed.27 That system remained in place until April \n2009.28 \n \nThere was one earlier purported alcohol-related incident which occurred in June \n2007.  Applicant and some friends were driving around when they decided to go out into \na field and sit around drinking beer by a bonfire.  Applicant decided against having any \nalcohol.29 A complaint was filed by someone and the police arrived and administered a \nbreathalyzer test to everyone.  All the tests come up with zeros.30  Nevertheless, he \nwas charged with a liquor violation (underage consumption).31 The charge was \ndismissed upon the prosecutor\u2019s m\n32\n \n18 Id. at 31, 33-34. \n \n19 Id. at 31-32. \n \n20 Government Exhibit 3 (Police Report, dated November 24, 2007), at  4-5. \n \n21 Tr. at 32. \n \n22 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 20, at 4. \n \n23 Id. \n \n24 Id. at 1; Government Exhibit 5 (Public Access to Court Information, dated June 25, 2008), at 1. \n \n25 Id.

On at least four occasions, after consuming alcohol,35 Applicant \nattempted to start his car, but was prevented from doing so by the breathalyzer ignition \nsystem installed in his vehicle. In June 2008, after four or five hours of sleep after \ndrinking the night before, he was probably legally intoxicated, but was not paying \nattention to how he felt because he was \u201cjust trying to get to work.\u201d36  He went to work \n20 minutes later.37 He estimates he was slightly impaired, but not intoxicated,38 in July \n2008, October 2008, and November 2008.39  \n \nApplicant continues to consume beer, but no hard liquor.40  His most recent \nconsumption of alcohol occurred two weeks prior to his hearing when he had one 16-\nounce beer.41 Despite the occasions of his alcohol impairment and intoxication, \nApplicant continues to believe he can handle alcohol,42 a belief he held in November \n2007 and June 2008. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d43 As Commander in Chief, \nthe President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \n \n \n32 Id. \n \n33 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 16, at 3-4. \n \n34 Id.  \n \n35 Tr. at 53. \n \n36 Id. at 47, 50-51, 53. \n \n37 Id. at 57-58. \n \n38 In other words, he would have registered a BAC of between 0.04 and 0.08.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon \na finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d44   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d45 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.46  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \n \n44 Exec.

Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d47 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d48 Thus, nothing \nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30:       \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 31(c), an Aallegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted,@ may raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, \ninvolving at least one arrest and conviction, numerous violations of underage drinking \nlaw, and a June 2007 complaint, later dismissed, is documented in his police and court \nrecords, his answers to interrogatories, and the evidence, including his testimony, \npresented during the hearing. The Government has established AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c).   \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ In addition, when there is \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the \noffense,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(c) may apply. Similarly, AG \u00b6 32(d) may apply when \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.@  \n \n47 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 \n \n48 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s largely unalleged (in the \nSOR) criminal conduct commenced when he was about 15 or 16 years old and \ncontinued until he could legally drink alcohol in October 2008, and his most recent SOR-\nalleged criminal conduct occurred in November 2007, a little over one and a quarter \nyears ago. Furthermore, there is no evidence of successful rehabilitation despite there \nbeing no further SOR-alleged criminal conduct. Had it not been for the breathalyzer \nignition system installed in his vehicle, Applicant might have experienced another \nalcohol-related incident in June 2008. While a person should not be held forever \naccountable for misconduct from the past, without a clear indication of subsequent \nreform, remorse, or rehabilitation, I am unable to determine with reasonable certainty \nthe probability that such conduct will not recur in the future.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies to his alleged offense in June 2007. While Applicant may \nhave been charged with a liquor violation for underage drinking, his explanation and the \nsubsequent prosecution-driven dismissal support my conclusion that there is insufficient \nevidence to indicate Applicant committed any offense. This particular criminal offense, \nwithout more, is unsubstantiated. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:  \n      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of \nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 22(b), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired \ncondition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d may raise security concerns. In addition, \u201chabitual \nor binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent, may \napply under AG \u00b6 22(c).  AG \u00b6 22(a) is established by Applicant\u2019s DUI conviction; AG \u00b6 \n22(b), by his June 2008 attempt to rush to work while intoxicated, and actually going to \nwork 20 minutes later; and AG \u00b6 22(c), because he habitually consumes alcohol to the \npoint of impaired judgment. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could potentially mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from alcohol consumption under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d). But in this \ninstance, none of the mitigating conditions apply. Furthermore, after careful \nconsideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol consumption, I conclude \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nApplicant\u2019s continued alcohol consumption to the point of impairment or intoxication \nafter his DUI conviction indicates he is unwilling or unable to curtail his alcohol \nconsumption. As such, his conduct demonstrates a lack of judgment and/or a failure to \ncontrol impulses which is inconsistent with the holder of a security clearance. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J and G in my analysis below.      \n \nWhile in high school, Applicant associated with the wrong crowd and developed \nbad habits. In part, due to peer pressure, he illegally consumed alcohol, sometimes to \nexcess. That alcohol abuse eventually resulted in an arrest and conviction for DUI. His \nsentence included one day in jail, a fine of $1,800, his license was suspended, and he \nwas ordered to attend traffic school, participate in counseling, and required to have a \nbreathalyzer ignition system installed in his vehicle, a system that remained in place \nuntil April 2009. That system has admittedly saved him from further, more recent, \nnegative alcohol-related incidents. \n \nDespite his March 2008, claim that his consumption of alcohol ceased with his \narrest in November 2007, and his stated intentions not to drink alcohol again at least \nuntil he turns 21 years old, and that he never plans to drive after consuming alcohol, he \nhas continued to consume alcohol and then attempt to drive his vehicle on at least four \noccasions. Using the analogy from the Appeal Board in financial cases, Applicant has \nnot established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of alcohol abstinence or more responsible \nalcohol consumption. To the contrary, his continued alcohol consumption and attempts \nat driving while impaired by alcohol, establish irresponsibility, immaturity, a cavalier \nattitude towards the law, and absence of rehabilitation, and vitiate any other mitigation \nsuch as the otherwise rehabilitative efforts of completing his counseling and serving his \nsentence. (See AG && 2(a)1, 2(a)(2), 2(a)(3), 2(a)4, 2(a)(5), 2(a)(6), 2(a)(7), and \n2(a)(9).) \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct \nand alcohol consumption security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On December 10, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMay 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn January 6, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 5, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing ten Items, \nand mailed Applicant a complete copy on February 10, 2009. Applicant received the \nFORM on February 17, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. Applicant did not submit any additional information. On \nApril 30, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \nthe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j.  \n  \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and divorced since August 2005. He has three children, \nwho live with his former wife. He pays child support through the court.  From 1993 until \nFebruary 2008, he worked for several different companies when he obtained a job, as a \nwarehouseman with a defense contractor. Over the course of those years, he was \nunemployed from September 2005 to May 2006 and from September 2007 to February \n2008. (Item 4) \n \n \nIn July 2005, Applicant filed a petition for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In November \n2005, the court entered an order discharging approximately $106,000 in liabilities, which \nincluded a $49,000 mortgage, $21,000 on two automobile loans, and $36,000 in \nmedical bills and credit card debts. His petition noted that his year-to-date income for \n2005 was $14,300, for 2004 it was $28,600, and for 2003 it was $27,000. (Item 9)  \n \n \n In August 2008, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories related to his \nfinances and several delinquent debts. He noted that he was unaware of some of the \ndelinquent debts, but that he would investigate the matters. (Item 6) According to the \nbudget he submitted, his yearly salary is around $24,000. His net monthly income is \n$1,400 and expenses are $1,095, leaving about $300 as a remainder at the end of the \nmonth. (Item 6) In his Answer, he stated he was pursuing a second job to help pay his \ndebts. \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR), dated March 2008, September 2008 and \nNovember 2008, the SOR alleged eight delinquent debts, totaling $28,697. The status \nof the debts is as follows: \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a for $610 is a medical bill. Applicant claimed he is making \npayments on the bill, but did not provide any documentation. (Item 6) It \nremains unpaid or unresolved.  \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b for $172 is a medical bill. Applicant stated he is making monthly \npayments on this bill, but did not submit proof of those payments. It remains \nunpaid or unresolved. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c for $6,777 appears to be a loan or credit card debt. It was sold to \nthe creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. It is listed as a debt of $8,110 in a credit \nreport, as well as in the Interrogatories Applicant answered. (Item 5 at  39, 40; \nItem 7 at 2; Item 8 at 2; Item 6) It was not included in the Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, as Applicant asserted. (Items 6 and  9) It remains unpaid or \nunresolved. \n \n4.  SOR \u00b6 1.d. for $441 is a debt owed to a cable company. Applicant disputed \nthe debt. (Item 7) \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e for $8,110. (See SOR \u00b6 1.c) It is listed as $6,777 on the \nSeptember and November 2008 CBRs. (Item 7 and 8) \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f for $562 was owed to an apartment complex. It was discharged in \nthe 2005 bankruptcy. (Item 8 at 2) \n \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g for $326 is a debt owed to a telephone company. Applicant \nclaimed he contacted the creditor, who told him the account was closed. It \ndoes not appear on the September or November 2008 CBR. It is resolved.   \n \n8. SOR \u00b6 1.h for $11,699 is owed on an automobile. It is listed on the March \n2008 CBR, which indicates that it was transferred or sold to another \ncompany. (Item 5 at 39). It does not appear on the September or November \n2008 CBRs, nor is any similar amount listed. (Items 7 and 8) Applicant did not \naddress this debt in either the Interrogatories or Answer.  It remains \nunresolved. \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant owes about $19,250 in delinquent debt, rather than the \n$28,697 alleged in the SOR, of which $11,699 is owed on an account that was opened \nin January 2006, after the bankruptcy discharge order was entered in November 2005. \n(Item 5 at 39) Applicant did not provide any documentation that he has addressed any \nof the debts. \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\n \n4 \n \n \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n5 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19, two of them are potentially disqualifying: \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nBased on three CBRs and his admissions, Applicant has been unable or \nunwilling to satisfy debts that began accruing prior to filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n2005 and subsequent to a discharge of approximately $106,000 in November 2005. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these two disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. The guideline \nincludes six examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are not isolated and began prior to 2005, \nwhen he filed bankruptcy and continued after the completion of the bankruptcy. Hence, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2 (a) cannot apply. Some of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties may be the result of \nlow paying positions and two extended periods of unemployment, during and after he \nfiled for bankruptcy. However, there is no evidence in the record indicating that he \nresponsibly managed his finances after November 2005 and subsequent to that time, \nwhich is necessary for full application of this mitigating condition. Thus, AG & 20(b) has \nlimited application. Applicant did not present any evidence that he received credit \ncounseling or that the outstanding delinquent debts are resolved or under control, as \nrequired under AG & 20(c). Applicant claimed he is paying two medical debts but did not \nsubmit any evidence of those payments; AG & 20(d) is not applicable. There is \nevidence indicating that he disputed one of the debts; AG & 20(e) is applicable. The \nrecord does not support the application of AG & 20(f).  \n  \n Whole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 35-years old and has \nworked for a defense contractor since February 2008. Prior to that, he experienced two \nperiods of unemployment, which could account for his financial difficulties since the \nNovember 2005 discharge of debt in bankruptcy.  \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant learned of the Government\u2019s concerns about his \nfinances and indicated that he would begin resolving them. In December 2008, he again \nreceived notice of those concerns through the SOR, but did not take steps or submit \nany information indicating that he was attempting to resolve the debts or further explain \nhis situation. Without such proof, there is insufficient information in the record to mitigate \nthe financial concerns. His failure to address the issues over the past year raises \nquestions about his judgment.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h through 1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is granted. \n \nOn January 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines H and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 9, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 19, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 23, 2009, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on April 23, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 6, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and the record was \nheld open to allow him to submit documents. He submitted one exhibit that was marked \nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. Department Counsel did not object and it was admitted \nand the record closed.1 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 30, \n2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 26 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since February \n2008. Prior to this employment he worked in a bicycle store for the past ten years, both \npart-time while in college and full-time. He is single and engaged to be married. He is a \ncollege graduate. His current job is the first that he considers a career job in the \u201creal \nworld.\u201d2  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he tried marijuana once when he was in middle school \nbetween 1996 and 1998. He did not remember the year. He did not use marijuana again \nuntil he was in college. He used it between 8 to 10 times from 2000 to 2004. He never \npurchased marijuana, but would use it when it was passed to him at parties. He did not \nparticularly like the way it made him feel. He stopped using marijuana after he \ngraduated from college, except for one time in May 2007, when he got together with a \nfriend and used it. He has not used marijuana since the 2007 use. He regrets his use \nand was mad at himself for using it. He has made a conscious decision never to use \nmarijuana or any other illegal drugs in the future.3  \n \n \nFor recreation Applicant rides mountain bikes. In 2001 he broke two bones in his \narm and needed surgery. He was prescribed Percocet for pain. He used it as prescribed \nfor the pain from the surgery, but also used it later for other pain he had after he \nresumed mountain biking. He did not have a prescription at the time he used it for pain \nnot associated with his surgery and was given pills by his friends. Applicant had a \nsecond prescription for Percocet after he had his wisdom teeth removed. He legally \nused the drug for pain after this procedure. He also used it on occasion for recreational \nuse not associated with pain from his wisdom teeth. He estimated that he used it \napproximately 5 to 10 times for sports-related pain and about 10 to 15 times for \nrecreational use during 2002 to 2004. He was not addicted to its use. He also used \nPercocet without a prescription one time in 2007 after he had been bike riding and was \n \n1 HE I. \n \n2 Tr. 20-21. \n \n3 Tr. 24-25, 43-52, 75, 91-92. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nexperiencing pain. He does not intend to use this or any other legal drug without a \nprescription in the future.4  \n \n \nOn one occasion in early 2001 Applicant\u2019s roommate asked him for a Percocet \npill. Applicant provided him a pill. He thinks his roommate may have offered him money \nfor the pill, but could not remember. He does not believe if money was offered that he \naccepted it. Applicant never paid money for the pills he accepted from friends.5 \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on December 4, \n2007. In the SCA he did not divulge he had used Percocet without a prescription or his \nMay 2007 marijuana use. He stated that he struggled with whether the Percocet use \nwas something he should divulge because he did have a valid prescription for the drug, \nbut also knew he had used it improperly. After he completed the SCA he asked his \nfriends whether he should have divulged this information and they advised him he \nshould have done so. He also asked his security manager and was advised the same. \nApplicant credibly testified that because this was his first \u201creal\u201d job he was very nervous \nabout doing the right thing. He did not really know what he should do at that point, but \nwas aware that he was going to be put in for a higher clearance shortly and would have \nto complete new paperwork. He decided to wait until that time to divulge the information. \nRegarding his failure to list the May 2007 marijuana use Applicant credibly testified that \nhe forgot about this use. Later he recalled it and decided to divulge it on his next \napplication. Applicant completed a new SCA on February 13, 2008, approximately two \nmonths after the previous one, and divulged his illegal use of Percocet at that time and \nthe May 2007 marijuana use. The investigator was unaware of these facts until \nApplicant voluntarily divulged then on the updated SCA. Applicant understands he \nshould have divulged this information on his first SCA, but did divulge it during his first \nopportunity to do so before being confronted with the information by an investigator.6  \n \n \nIn an interview with an Office of Personnel Management Investigator conducted \non March 12, 2008, Applicant stated he first used marijuana in 2000. On September 16, \n2008, he sworn to the accuracy of the Results of Interview included as an attachment to \nInterrogatories.7 Question 5 allowed Applicant to provide additional information. He \nwrote: \u201cPlease see attached sheet.\u201d The attached sheet was a letter from Applicant to \nthe investigator stating the following: \u201cAdditionally, I now recall, to the best of my \nknowledge, the first time that I tried marijuana as occurring earlier, some time between \n1996 and 1998 at a friend\u2019s house.\u201d Applicant credibly testified that he forgot that his \nfirst use of marijuana was when he was in middle school rather than in 2000 and \n \n4 Tr. 22, 52-59, 62-66, 92. \n \n5 Applicant listed other types of prescription drugs on his SCA that were provided by friends to \nhim. He was not sure, in some instances, if what he took was actually Percocet or another type of pain \nkiller, such as Vicodin or codeine. However, the total times he admitted using prescription drugs illegally \nincluded all these drugs.  \n \n6 Tr. 22-34, 59-62, 67, 72-77, 87-91. \n \n7 AE 3 \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ncorrected the discrepancy. I find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. He did not use \nmarijuana again until college. The question did not require he divulge this use because \nit occurred between 1996 and 1998, which was more than seven years earlier.8  \n \n \nApplicant continues to ride mountain bikes, but no longer associates with most of \nthose friends who gave him the drugs, except for a few, who live out of state. He does \nnot use drugs with anyone and does not know if his friends continue to use prescription \ndrugs. He credibly testified that he has moved on to a different point in his life and \nbegan to realize he has responsibilities that are important. He has a good job with \nprospects of a good career; he is engaged to be married; and he has matured \nsignificantly. He has put his drug use behind him. He is committed to a drug free future. \nHis fianc\u00e9 and some of his family are aware of his past drug use.9  \n \n \nApplicant provided character letters that I have considered. His supervisor \nbelieves him to be an exemplary employee who has proved to be trustworthy, proactive \nand a valuable asset to the team. The production manager for whom Applicant works \nconsiders Applicant\u2019s work outstanding. He is diligent and exercises an attention to \ndetail and understanding of security concerns that he is confronted with on a daily basis. \nHe is considered a trustworthy person with the utmost integrity. Another co-worker \ndescribes Applicant as always willing to go the \u201cextra mile for the team.\u201d10 In addition, \ntwo persons who have known Applicant for most of his life provided statements. They \nconsider him to be honest, conscientious, and trustworthy, with impeccable character \nand values. Through his life experiences he has developed into a person with the \nqualities to be an efficient and effective leader. He is a man with integrity, honor, and \ncreativity.11  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n \n8 Tr. 25, 34-37, 72, 91. \n \n9 Tr. 38-40, 65, 74, 78-78, 86. \n \n10 AE A.  \n \n11 Tr. 80-85; Attachments to Answer. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Drugs are \ndefined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) \nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) \ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \nand especially considerer the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse, and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana once in middle school and while in college from 2000 \nto 2004 on eight to ten occasions. He then used it one more time in 2007. He also \nillegally used a prescription drug for recreation and when not prescribed.  I find all of the \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 \n26 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened \nunder circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and  \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period \nof abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana primarily while in college on an infrequent basis, eight \nto ten times over a four year period. He had an additional use in 2007. He also used a \nprescription drug when it was not prescribed for pain and sometimes for recreation. This \nuse was primarily in 2002 to 2003 and a one time use in 2007. He credibly testified that \nhe does not intend to use any illegal drugs or ones not prescribed in the future. It has \nbeen approximately a year and a half since his last use. Although this is not an \nextensive period of abstinence, I have considered this in conjunction with Applicant\u2019s \ncommitment and the fact that he is a young man who has matured with the growing \nresponsibility of his career and his impending marriage. He has moved past his period \nof youthful indiscretion and developed into a mature young man. I find mitigating \ncondition (a) apply because Applicant\u2019s actions are unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant for the most part no longer associates with friends who use drugs and \ndrugs are no longer a part of his life. He does not know whether his associates continue \n\n \n7 \n \n \nto use drugs. He is not involved enough with them to know. He primarily used the drugs \nduring his college years, with a one time lapse for both marijuana and Percocet in 2007. \nSince then he is committed to remaining drug free and with a mature responsible focus \non his future. He credibly testified he intends never to use illegal drugs or prescribed \ndrugs illegally in the future. I find mitigating condition (b) applies.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted that he had difficulty deciding whether to include on his first \nSCA that he had used a prescription drug for other than its intended use. He seemed to \nbe rationalizing whether he needed to divulge it. He chose not to do so on his first SCA. \nI find this was a deliberate omission and disqualifying condition (a) applies to these \nfacts. Applicant also did not divulge his one time use of marijuana in 2007. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and candid responses at his hearing. I find Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation credible that he forgot the 2007 marijuana use and divulged it later when he \nremembered on his subsequent SF 86. The inconsistent admission as to his first use of \nmarijuana occurring in 2000 and later corrected to occurring sometime in 1996 to 1998, \nI find was not a deliberate falsification. This was a use that did not have to be divulged. \nIn his attempt to be completely thorough and honest he corrected the information by \nproviding a supplemental statement. It is inconsistent to believe that he would feel the \nneed to hide this use. Therefore, I find Applicant did not deliberately provide inaccurate \ninformation as to his first use of marijuana and therefore no disqualifying conditions \napply to these facts.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered the following under AG \u00b6 17: \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts, and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nAfter Applicant completed his first SCA he asked his friends about whether he \nshould have divulged his use of prescription drugs. They advised him to do so. \nUndeniably it would have been better had Applicant immediately notified the appropriate \nauthorities, however, he was new to the process and confused about how to go about it. \nThis may sound somewhat naive or disingenuous, however I found Applicant to be \nsincere and credible. He was aware that his security clearance was to be upgraded in a \nshort time, so he waited until he completed his next SCA, two months later. At that time \nhe voluntarily divulged his use of prescription drugs. He corrected this omission before \nhe was confronted with the facts. These are facts the government would not have \nknown had Applicant not divulged them. Although his actions were not as timely as they \ncould have been, I find the period of time to be reasonable. Therefore, I find mitigating \ncondition (a) applies.  \n \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s omission was not minor, but it was infrequent and it is unlikely to \nhappen again. Applicant is now familiar with the process and understands the obligation \nto divulge any derogatory information. I do not find his actions cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment and conclude mitigating condition (c) \napplies.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant experienced a period of \nyouthful indiscretion when he used marijuana and a prescription drug. He admitted he \nwas young and immature. He has since taken on adult responsibilities and has a \nbudding career and is engaged to be married. He no longer uses any illegal drugs or \nillegally uses prescription drugs and never intends to again. He struggled with whether \nhe was required to divulge his prescription drug use and chose not to divulge it. He did \ndivulge it later voluntarily and before confronted with the facts. I observed Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor and credibility throughout the hearing. I also considered his past conduct in \nthe context of his age, motivation and maturity and made a risk assessment. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with no serious questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from drug involvement and personal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 17, 2007. On \nAugust 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline G. DOHA acted under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented within the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 2, 2009; answered it on September \n23, 2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nMay 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwas ready to proceed on January 10, 2010, and the case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 19, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 27, 2010, scheduling \nthe hearing for February 17, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified, presented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A through I, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on February 25, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR and \noffered explanations. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated \nin my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor since June \n2000. She worked for a defense contractor after graduating from college in 1986, and \nthen began working in private industry in 1994. (Tr. 66-67.) She is married and has two \nchildren, ages 17 and 13. She received a security clearance in June 2000. \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol in high school, when she was 15 years old. \nShe consumed one or two beers at parties about once a month. In college, she \nincreased her consumption to two or three beers twice a month, but every two or three \nmonths she would drink three or four beers and become intoxicated. After college she \ncontinued to drink beer but started drinking wine and mixed drinks, and she became \nintoxicated every two or three months. (GX 4 at 3-4.) \n \n \nApplicant reduced her drinking between 1992 and 1996 after her children were \nborn. She continued to drink wine, but not to the point of intoxication. Between early \n1997 and 2005, she stopped drinking beer but continued to drink wine and mixed \ndrinks, and she drank to intoxication about every other month. (GX 4 at 4.) \n \n \nApplicant found the combination of the demands of being a spouse, a mother, \nand a professional engineer difficult and stressful. In 2005, she began using alcohol to \nrelax at the end of the day, and her consumption increased to about two bottles of wine \na week. (GX 4 at 4; Tr. 73.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband became concerned about her excessive drinking and \nencouraged her to seek help. She consulted with her physician, who did not treat her for \nalcohol abuse, but prescribed anti-anxiety medications and recommended that she seek \ntreatment from an alcohol addiction counselor and a psychiatrist. (GX 4 at 5.) She \nfollowed her physician\u2019s advice. Her psychiatrist diagnosed her as alcohol dependent. \n(AX A.) She completed a three-day inpatient detoxification program from January 25 \nthrough January 28, 2006, followed by an intensive outpatient program in February and \nMarch 2006. She began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings regularly after \ncompleting the outpatient program. (Tr. 77-78.)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant resumed her alcohol use in the summer of 2006. She underwent a one-\nweek inpatient detoxification and treatment from October 20-26, 2006, and she was \ndiagnosed by a medical doctor as suffering from depression and alcohol dependency. \nRecommended aftercare included intensive outpatient treatment and AA participation. \n(GX 7 at 5-6). She participated in an intensive outpatient program from October 30, \n2006 to November 27, 2006. Upon discharge, she was diagnosed as suffering from \nmajor depression and alcohol dependence, and she was given a referral to a \npsychiatrist and a therapist. (GX 9 at 2.) \n \nIn December 2006, her husband notified the police that she was intoxicated \nwhen she drove away from their home to attend an AA meeting. She was arrested for \ndriving while intoxicated (DUI) and reckless driving. After she pleaded guilty, her driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for seven months, she was fined, and she was required to \nattend an intoxicated driver\u2019s training program. She voluntarily entered an intensive \noutpatient program in December 2006, completed it in January 2007, and was \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent. The discharge summary contains no prognosis. (GX \n10 at 3.) \n \nAfter relapsing, Applicant entered a one-week detoxification program in February \n2007, followed by a 30-day residential treatment program that she completed in late \nMarch 2007. (GX 5 at 4; Tr. 84-85.) She relapsed again almost immediately, and was \nadmitted to a detoxification program on March 27, 2007, which she completed on April \n2, 2007. (GX 8 at 29-34.) She was diagnosed as alcohol dependent and in post-\nintoxication withdrawal, with major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and \nsubstance-induced sleep disorder. (GX 8 at 29-37.) She received additional treatment in \nApril and May 2007. (GX 5 at 4; AX B; Tr. 87-88.) She relapsed again, entered an \nintensive outpatient treatment program in May 2007, and completed it in July 2007. (AX \nC; Tr. 89-90.)  \n \nFollowing another relapse, Applicant completed a one-week inpatient treatment \nprogram in October 2007. (GX 5 at 4; Tr. 80-81.) She abstained from alcohol until she \n\u201chad a small slip\u201d in April 2008, when she purchased a bottle of wine, brought it home, \nand consumed a glass of it. (Tr. 90, 134.) She testified she had a \u201cmild physical \nreaction\u201d to the Antabuse she had been taking when she consumed the wine. (Tr. 135.) \nShe has abstained from alcohol since her relapse in April 2008. \n \nApplicant currently takes an antidepressant, a drug to suppress alcohol craving, \nAntabuse, and a sleep aid. (Tr. 99-100.) She continues to attend AA meetings about \nonce a week. (Tr. 102-03.) She does not have a regular AA sponsor. She testified that \nshe finds it very difficult to share her thoughts and feelings with others, making it difficult \nto form a bond with a sponsor. (Tr. 105-06.) \n \nApplicant continues to see her psychiatrist at about three-week intervals. (Tr. \n114.) In a letter written to DOHA in September 2009, her psychiatrist states that her \nproblems with anxiety \u201care currently in remission\u201d and she is \u201cquite stable in her \nrecovery from alcohol dependence and stable psychiatrically as well.\u201d (AX A at 2.) In a \n\n \n4 \n \n \nletter prepared for the hearing, her psychiatrist describes Applicant as \u201cquite stable in \nher recovery from alcoholism,\u201d a \u201cvastly different person,\u201d and fully fit for duty. He states \nthat her condition \u201chas been completely and successfully treated and no further \nimpairment exists.\u201d (AX A at 1.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband stopped consuming alcohol in 2000 because he thought it \nwas important for them to have a \u201csober household.\u201d (Tr. 92.) They have begun sharing \nfamily responsibilities. They have stopped attending social events centered on alcohol. \nThey now have a smaller group of friends who are mostly non-drinkers. (Tr. 148.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for two rating periods from October 2001 \nthrough September 2003 reflect a \u201cfully successful\u201d rating, in the middle of a five-point \nscale. She was rated as \u201cexcellent,\u201d the second highest rating, for October 2003 through \nSeptember 2004. She was rated as \u201coutstanding,\u201d the top rating, for October 2004 \nthrough September 2005. In December 2005, she was promoted to a more responsible \nposition. Her rating for October 2005 through September 2006 was \u201cexcellent.\u201d Her \nrating for October 2006 through September 2007 dropped to \u201cfully successful.\u201d (AX D \nand E.) She received performance awards in March 2002, November 2003, and \nSeptember 2004. (AX F, G, H, and I.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager since December 2005 testified that she is a \u201csuccessful \ncontributor.\u201d After she returned from sick leave in 2007, she was productive and \nvaluable. (Tr. 35-36.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s team leader since December 2007 testified he made her his deputy \nbecause he has confidence in her ability to fully manage the team as well as fulfill her \nindividual engineering assignments. He would rate her performance as \u201cexcellent.\u201d Even \nthough she works less than full time (30 hours per week), she gives \u201c110 percent.\u201d On \nseveral occasions, she has worked on her day off to make sure that commitments are \nmet. She is honest, responsible, and capable of performing under pressure. (Tr. 51-54, \n60-61.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the \npoint of intoxication, from about 1980 to at least April 2008. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.k, 1.m, and \n1.n allege multiple periods of treatment for alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence \nbetween December 2006 and July 2007. SOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a DUI arrest in December \n2006 and a subsequent conviction.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline G is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, \ntreatment for alcohol dependence, and multiple relapses raise the following disqualifying \ncondition under this guideline: AG 22(a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, \nsuch as driving while under the influence\u201d); AG \u00b6 22(c) (\u201chabitual or binge consumption \nof alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d); AG \u00b6 22(d) (\u201cdiagnosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) \nof alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\u201d); and AG \u00b6 22(f) (\u201crelapse after diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program\u201d). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (c), (d), and (f), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). Applicant has \nmaintained sobriety since October 2007, with one relapse in April 2008. Thus, the focus \nis on the first prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d). \n \nThere are no Abright line@ rules for determining how much time must pass to \nestablish AG \u00b6 23(a). The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the evidence. If the evidence shows that \u201ca significant period of time has \npassed\u201d without any evidence that the excessive alcohol consumption has recurred, \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \nAfter a long struggle and many relapses, Applicant finally gained control of her \nalcohol dependence in October 2007. Her single relapse was more than two years ago. \nShe has surrounded herself with a strong support structure, including her spouse, AA, \nand her psychiatrist. Although she has found it difficult to form a close bond with an AA \nsponsor, she has a long-standing, open, and beneficial relationship with her psychiatrist. \nHer husband stopped drinking in order to be more supportive of her continued sobriety. \nShe and her husband have reduced the domestic stress level by adjusting their division \nof family responsibilities. They have adjusted their lifestyle to avoid alcohol-centered \nactivities. Applicant has continued to perform well as an engineer. She is determined to \nmaintain sobriety. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(a) is established. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). This mitigating \ncondition is established, because Applicant has acknowledged her alcohol problem, \ntaken extensive and repeated actions to overcome it, has relapsed only once since \nOctober 2007, and has been continuously abstinent since April 2008, more than two \nyears ago. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual is a \ncurrent employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no \nhistory of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n23(c). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant has a history of \nprevious treatment and relapse. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if --   \n \nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d). This mitigating condition is established. Applicant has completed several \ninpatient and outpatient programs, attends AA meetings regularly, and has received a \nstrong and favorable prognosis from her psychiatrist.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, soft-spoken, introverted, intelligent woman. She is a \nperfectionist. She tried to balance her roles a spouse, mother, and professional \nengineer and was overwhelmed. From December 2006 to October 2007, she repeatedly \nsought professional help, relapsed several times, and persisted in her rehabilitative \nefforts until she finally made a breakthrough. She has adjusted her lifestyle to make it \nless stressful and found new friends. She has continued to participate in AA and seek \nthe counsel of her psychiatrist on a regular basis. She is controlling her anxiety and \ndepression with prescribed medications. She was calm, thoughtful, and candid as she \ntestified about her struggle with alcohol dependence. In spite of her repeated treatment \nand relapses she has retained the respect of her colleagues and supervisors.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline G, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption. Accordingly, I conclude \nshe has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, I conclude it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On February 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 17, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on April 16, 2009. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on April 17, 2009.  \nApplicant received the FORM on April 28, 2009. He had 30 days to submit a response \nto the FORM. He did not submit a response. On June 16, 2009, the FORM was \nforwarded to the hearing office. The FORM was assigned to me on June 17, 2009. \nJune 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations in the SOR. \n(Item 4) \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as a security officer with the \ndefense contractor since December 2007. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is married \nand has no children. (Item 5; Item 6)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed the following delinquent accounts:  \na $5,110 delinquent credit card account that was charged off in April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: \nItem 6 at 15, 22; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 5); an $8,331 credit card account that was \ncharged off in May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 6 at 14, 23, 29-30; Item 7 at 3; Item 8 at 6); a \n$1,898 account that was charged off in April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 6 at 15, 23; Item 7 \nat 3; Item 8 at 10); a $6,382 department store credit card account that was placed for \ncollection in May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item 6 at 14, 24, 31; Item 7 at 3; Item 8 at 11, 19); \nand a $3,035 account that was placed for collection in May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 6 at \n15, 25; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 13). \n \nOn August 21, 2008, Applicant provided a Personal Financial Statement in \nresponse to interrogatories. He listed he and his spouse\u2019s net monthly income as \n$2,692.60. Monthly expenses were $820 and monthly debt payments consisted of \n$2,582.48. After expenses and debt payments, Applicant has a negative balance of \n$754.88 each month. (Item 6 at 5) \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began about four years ago. Applicant was laid off \nand a few months later his wife was laid off as well. He was unable to find a job for a \nyear. During the year he was unemployed, he took online courses towards completing \nhis bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice. His wife eventually found a job with a mortgage \ncompany and Applicant was hired by the same company about four months later. They \nwere not making as much money as in their prior jobs. About a year later, both \nApplicant and his wife were laid off.  His wife soon found a job. Applicant searched for a \njob and continued to take courses. After graduating from college, Applicant had difficulty \nfinding employment. He and his wife were unable to pay the bills. They discussed filing \nbankruptcy but felt an obligation to pay their bills.  In September 2007, his wife was laid \noff again. She was unemployed for five months and found a job that paid significantly \nless than what she was making. She got a second job at night in order to meet \nexpenses. \n \nApplicant was hired by his current employer in December 2007. His wife was let \ngo from her day job. She currently works part-time as a cashier and continues to look \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfor employment. They hope to resolve their credit issues. The current status of the \ndelinquent accounts are:    \n \nSOR \u00b61.a: $5,110 charged off credit card account. The debt is not paid. \nApplicant was offered a settlement of $4,235 or $321 a month. He and his wife were not \nable to afford the monthly payment. (Item 4 at 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: $8,331 charged off credit card account. Applicant states that he set \nup a payment plan in July 2008. He claims that they have timely paid $50 a month since \nthat time but offered no proof of payment such as bank records, cancelled checks or a \nreceipt from the company. (Item 4 at 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $1,898 charged off deficiency resulting from an automobile \nrepossession. Applicant states he and his wife have paid $105.45 per month on this \ndebt. The company offered to settle the account for $900. Applicant hopes to resolve \nthis debt with his income tax return. He provided no proof that payments were made \neach month in a timely manner and/or proof the debt was resolved. (Item 4 at 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: $6,382 credit card account placed for collection. Applicant claims he \narranged a payment plan of $30 a month. He claims he has made payments each \nmonth over the phone or by sending in a check. He provided no proof of payments. \n(Item 4 at 3)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $3,035 account placed for collection. Applicant was offered a \nsettlement of $3,200 or payments of $119 per month over a period of 36 months. \nApplicant and his wife were unable to afford the monthly payment. (Item 4 at 3) \n \nApplicant states that he and his wife have every intention of paying off their \ndebts. He indicates they will have an extra $105 each month once the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is settled.  In May 2009, their first mortgage lien payment will decrease by \n$170 because they will no longer have an escrow shortfall.  They plan to use the \nadditional money to pay down debts. (Item 4)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Between 2006 and 2007, Applicant \nincurred 5 delinquent debts, totaling $24,756.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are relatively recent. None of the delinquent accounts \nhave been resolved. Applicant claims he is incapable of resolving all of these delinquent \naccounts. His household debts are greater than his income each month.     \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant and his wife \nhave been laid off on numerous occasions within the past several years which affected \ntheir ability to pay their debts. It is not clear whether Applicant acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Applicant claims he was unable to find work for a period of two \nyears. While he took on-line college courses during this time, one could argue that he \ncould have found some sort of part-time employment to help out with the household \nbills.       \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling. While Applicant claims that he has entered repayment plans for three of the \nfive accounts, he admits that he is unable to afford the payments on the two remaining \ndebts. He provided no proof to corroborate his assertions that he is timely making \npayments towards three of the accounts. He admits that he and his wife have a \nnegative monthly balance each month. His financial situation is unlikely to be resolved \nsoon. \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) partially applies. Applicant claims he has been \npaying towards three of the accounts. However, he did not provide documentation \nwhich would corroborate his statement. He has been unable to pay on two of the \naccounts because he cannot afford to make payments.  \n \nAlthough Applicant has been employed since December 2007, he took no action \ntowards resolving his delinquent accounts. He claims he does not have the means to \nrepay all of his accounts but hopes to repay all of them in the future. His inability to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresolve his delinquent accounts remains a security concern. He has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a significant amount \nof unresolved delinquent debt. Although his financial problems were aggravated by  \nseveral periods of unemployment over the past three years, Applicant remains unable to \nmeet his financial obligations as well as pay his delinquent debts. He provided \ninsufficient documentation to corroborate that he and his wife have been timely making \npayments on three of the accounts. Applicant has failed to meet his burden to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant is a 37-year-old aircraft mechanic who works on the B-1 bomber. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1993 to 2004. Since his discharge, he has worked a series of jobs as an aircraft mechanic. He has been continuously employed for many years except for about a two-month period in 2005 (Tr. 43\u201344). He held a security clearance while serving in the Air Force, and he is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. He completed a security-clearance application in January 2008 (Exhibit 1). It required Applicant to disclose information about his background, to include his financial record.

The action\nis based on (1) a history of financial problems, to include child-support arrears, a\ndelinquent governmental debt, and bad checks, and (2) the falsification of a January\n2008 security-clearance application, when Applicant denied Question 28a about having\nbeen more than 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years. The record\ncontains insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns\nstemming from his history of financial problems, which are ongoing and unresolved for\nthe most part. And the record contains insufficient evidence to prove that his answer to\nQuestion 28a was deliberately false; his answer was negligently or recklessly incorrect,\nbut it was not knowingly and willfully false. Accordingly, as explained in detail below, this\ncase is decided against Applicant. \nAugust 17, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then\nmodified by the Defense Department, and made effective September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They\nsupersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.  \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on December 18, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details\nthe factual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F\nfor financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct, and it recommended\nsubmitting Applicant\u2019s case to an administrative judge for a determination to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about February 2, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2009. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on June 16, 2009. The government presented documentary exhibits (Exhibits\n1\u20135) and called no witnesses. Applicant presented documentary exhibits (Exhibits A\u2013F),\ncalled no witnesses, and testified on his own behalf. The transcript (Tr.) was received\non June 24, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all allegations under Guideline F. He denied the falsification\nallegation under Guideline E, contending that his answer was mistaken, but he did not\nintend to give a false answer to the question. His admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old aircraft mechanic who works on the B-1 bomber. He\nserved on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1993 to 2004. Since his discharge, he\nhas worked a series of jobs as an aircraft mechanic. He has been continuously\nemployed for many years except for about a two-month period in 2005 (Tr. 43\u201344). He\nheld a security clearance while serving in the Air Force, and he is seeking to obtain an\nindustrial security clearance for the first time. \nHe completed a security-clearance application in January 2008 (Exhibit 1). It\nrequired Applicant to disclose information about his background, to include his financial\nrecord. In response to Question 28a, he answered in the negative thereby denying that\nhe had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years. In\nresponse to both multi-part questions about finances (Questions 27 and 28), he\nanswered all questions in the negative except for a question about repossession of\n\n3\nproperty, to which he disclosed a car repossession in 2004. He also disclosed the bad\nchecks in response to a question about his police record. \nTwo credit reports from 2008 establish that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems (Exhibits 4 and 5). His financial problems include child-support arrears, a\ndelinquent governmental debt, bad checks, a deficiency balance stemming from the\nrepossessed car, and other delinquent debts. \nThe child-support arrears (alleged SOR \u00b6 1.a) are based on a court order to pay\nchild support for his three minor sons. In February 2008, the arrearage was about\n$7,171, and it was reduced to about $6,316 by November 2008 (Exhibits 4 and 5). In\nMarch 2009, child-support enforcement issued an income-withholding order or wage\ngarnishment to Applicant\u2019s employer (Exhibits B and C). It requires withholding of $610\nmonthly, which includes $125 monthly for child-support arrears greater than 12 weeks.\nIn May 2009, Applicant\u2019s federal income tax refund of $2,114 was intercepted and\napplied to the child-support arrears (Exhibit A). Applicant estimates the current\narrearage is about $3,900 (Tr. 35\u201336).  \nThe delinquent governmental debt (alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b) is for repayment of a\nreenlistment bonus Applicant received from the Air Force. The government is seeking\nrepayment of the bonus because Applicant did not satisfy the terms of his reenlistment\ncontract when he was discharged. In February 2008, the balance was about $11,207,\nand it was reduced to about $9,295 by November 2008 (Exhibits 4 and 5). It has been\nreduced by interception of his federal income tax refunds; otherwise, he has made no\npayments on this debt (Tr. 47\u201348).\nApplicant wrote multiple bad checks (alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.I, and 1.k), and\nsome of those checks led to criminal prosecution. He estimates the total of bad checks\nwas about $3,400 (Tr. 30). The documentary evidence shows that he wrote about 29\nbad checks (mostly for small amounts to fast-food businesses and other vendors) for a\ntotal of about $2,800 that were resolved by payment and pleading guilty to a\nmisdemeanor (Exhibit 2). He had no information about the three bad checks placed for\ncollection for $65, $63, and $75 (alleged in  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.I), and which appear in\nhis February 2008 credit report (Tr. 55\u201357; Exhibit 5).   \nThe remaining delinquent debts (alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j)\ntotal about $10,946. All these debts are unpaid, Applicant has no repayment\nagreements or plans in place, and he has not made any type of regular payment on\nthem (Tr. 73\u201374). \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to a combination of: (1) his discharge\nfrom the Air Force in 2004 that resulted in a decline in income; (2) a divorce in 2003;\nand (3) an apathetic attitude\u2014\u201cI just didn\u2019t care about anything\u201d\u2014after the divorce (Tr.\n30). It took Applicant a couple of years to get his life together, and he has done so by\nmoving back to the state where his sons live and reestablishing a relationship with\nthem. To that end, he spent a large amount of money on his sons to make up for the\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n2\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n3\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n4\n4\npast. Also, he gives his ex-wife $200 monthly for child support, which is in addition to\nthe monies withheld from his pay for child support. He loves his current job, and it is the\nfirst job in the last four years that he has been paid well enough to attempt to address\nhis delinquent debts (Tr. 32, 35). \nHe estimates that his gross income for 2009 will be about $50,000 to $55,000\n(Tr. 35). He has about $500 in cash reserves, about $370 in a bank account, and no\nother financial accounts (Tr. 68\u201369). He is current with his car payment of $245 per\nmonth (Tr. 71). No one is actively attempting to collect a debt from him, and no one is\nsuing him for collection of a debt (Tr. 71\u201372). He is not under court-ordered supervision\nor probation as a result of the bad checks conviction (Tr. 73). \nConsistent with how he answered the SOR, Applicant explained that he\nanswered Question 28a in the negative because he really did not know who he owed\ndue to his past apathy (Tr. 32\u201333). Under cross-examination, he admitted that he knew\nhe was 180 days past due on bills, he admitted that he knew he owed some creditor for\na 180-day past-due account, and he could not explain why he did not answer Question\n28a in the affirmative and simply state on the security-clearance application that he\ncould not provide the details about the debts (Tr. 65\u201366). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n2\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n3\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n4\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n11\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n12\n5\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n5\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n7\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n8\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n9\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.10\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met\n12\nthe strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security\nclearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n13\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at p. 10.\n14\n6\nAnalysis\n1.\nThe record contains insufficient evidence to prove that his answer to\nQuestion 28a was deliberately false.  \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n13\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, security concerns may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n14\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 28a of his\nsecurity-clearance application. He denied having any delinquent accounts (180 days\npast due and currently 90 days past due) in response to both Questions 28a and 28b.\nBut he disclosed a car repossession and the bad checks in response to other questions\non the application. He admitted that he knew he was 180 days past due with some\ncreditor when he answered Question 28a. In addition, his background as an Air Force\nveteran and prior clearance holder is part of the analysis. In that regard, Applicant likely\nknew that a credit check was part of a background investigation.  \nBased on the record, I am not persuaded that Applicant was lying when he\nanswered Question 28a. First, his explanation that he did not know with certainty whom\nhis creditors were is credible, because  his finances were in disarray due to his neglect.\nSecond, he likely knew that a credit check was part of his background investigation,\nwhich militates against a deliberate effort to hide or conceal the information. Third, he\ndisclosed other derogatory information (the repossession and bad checks) about his\nfinances. His disclosures also militate against the case that he was deliberately omitting,\nconcealing, or falsifying information when he answered Question 28a. Taken together,\nthese reasons support a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 28a was\nnegligently or recklessly incorrect; however, his answer was not knowingly and willfully\nfalse. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant.  \n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n DC 4 is \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income\n19\ntax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches\nof trust.\u201d \n7\n2.\nThe record contains insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems.\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems raises security concerns because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n17\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record shows Applicant\n18\nhas child-support arrears and a delinquent governmental debt, both of which are\nongoing and unresolved. He wrote numerous bad checks resulting in a misdemeanor\nconviction. He has several other delinquent debts, to include a deficiency balance from\nthe car repossession, totaling nearly $11,000. And he has taken virtually no action on\nthose debts. These facts and circumstances are more than sufficient to establish these\ntwo disqualifying conditions as well as a pattern of financial irresponsibility. In addition,\nthe bad checks conviction qualifies as a deceptive or illegal financial practice within the\nmeaning of the guideline.  \n19\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\n\n8\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Although Applicant experienced financial difficulties after his divorce\nand discharge from the Air Force, MC 2 does not apply because he did not act\nresponsibly under the circumstances. It appears he simply gave up\u2014he did not care\u2014\nmaking a bad situation worse. Applicant paid the bad checks, along with extra fees, to\nresolve the criminal prosecution. Otherwise, there is little evidence of voluntary\npayments. The child-support arrears and the governmental debt have been paid down\nby intercepting his federal income tax refund. Given these circumstances, credit in\nmitigation under MC 4 for good-faith efforts is not justified. \nHis financial problems are not minor, and his financial problems are current and\nongoing. His generosity to his sons is understandable and commendable, but it has not\nimproved his overall record of financial responsibility. And the lack of a realistic plan to\naddress the other delinquents debts does not speak well for Applicant. Given these\ncircumstances, it is too soon to tell if Applicant will resolve his outstanding delinquent\ndebts in a reasonable time and then continue to be a financially responsible person. At\nthis time, the likelihood of additional or continuing financial problems cannot be ruled\nout. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant.  \n3.\nThe whole-person concept does not support a favorable decision. \nI also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept, which requires\nan administrative judge to evaluate a person\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the\nperson\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider\nthe nine factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 1\u20132. \n20\n9\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n20\nApplicant is an experienced and mature individual who should be able to handle\nhis financial obligations without the difficulties he has experienced. At this time, he has a\ngood job and earns a decent salary. He has good intentions and wants to resolve his\nindebtedness. These circumstances weigh in his favor.\nApplicant also has a good employment record. Indeed, three individuals\nsubmitted letters vouching for Applicant as a dependable, reliable, and hard-working\nemployee who is trustworthy (Exhibits D, E, and F). But a good employment record, by\nitself, is not sufficient to mitigate the concerns. \nClearly, he now has a changed attitude and that is for the good. But he is yet to\nclean up the mess he made of his finances. The two credit reports from 2008 establish\na highly derogatory credit history, which is ongoing. Both his child-support arrears and\nthe delinquent governmental debt are viewed with disfavor given the nature of the\nobligations. He presented no paperwork on the other delinquent debts totaling nearly\n$11,000. This is consistent with his testimony that he has done little to address those\ndebts. Given these circumstances, I am unable to predict if he is likely to favorably\nresolve his outstanding delinquent debts in the foreseeable future. Likewise, I am not\npersuaded that his history of financial problems is a thing of the past and will not be an\nitem of concern in the future. Without a well-established track record of financial\nresponsibility, the clearly-consistent standard requires an unfavorable decision.\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.k:\n \nAgainst Applicant\n\n This allegation, which merely cross-referenced the bad checks prosecution in SOR \u00b6 1.k, was adequately\n21\ncovered under Guideline F, and it has no independent security significance under Guideline E. Accordingly,\nit is decided for Applicant. \n10\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant \n21\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.    \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq. Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant had a bankruptcy, an unpaid judgment and 11 accounts that were \ncharged off or placed for collection, which totaled approximately $16,500. Applicant has \nrebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under financial considerations. \nClearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nStatement of Reasons (SORs) issued after September 1, 2006. \n1 \nMarch 19, 2010\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on May 26, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn June 26, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nAugust 5, 2009, I was assigned the case. On August 17, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing which was held on September 23, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through R, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On October 2, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. On \nOctober 5, 2009, additional material was submitted. Department Counsel had no \nobjection to the material, which was admitted into the record as Ex. S through U.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she admitted the SOR factual allegations, with \nexplanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. \nAfter a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old administrative assistant who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since February 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Her \ncompany has twice recognized Applicant\u2019s exceptional performance. (Ex. T) At work, \nshe is vice president of the Hispanic employees network. (Ex. U, Tr. 37, 38) \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband incurred medical debts when his jaw was broken. Pursuant \nto a victim\u2019s panel, the other individual was determined to be at fault and was required \nto pay the medical bills, but failed to do so. (Tr. 39) In October 2002, Applicant and her \nhusband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and the debts were discharged in \nFebruary 2003.  \n \n \nFrom July 2003 through February 2004, Applicant was unemployed. While \nunemployed, Applicant incurred three medical debts without medical insurance. Those \ndebts were: $382 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $8,704 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and, $407 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant \nhad to undergo emergency surgery and remained in the hospital for three days. (Tr. 39) \n \n \nIn March 2005, Applicant lost all her possessions in a house fire. (Tr. 29) They \nwere renters and did not have insurance to cover their loss. (Tr. 43) Following the fire, \nApplicant obtained loans to pay for necessities. All of their income went to rebuilding \ntheir lives, purchasing clothing, and necessary goods. (Tr. 46) These events resulted in \nfinancially difficult times for Applicant. Two month\u2019s later, her husband\u2019s grandmother \nsuffered a stroke and died, and her bother-in-law was killed in a car accident. From \nSeptember 2005 through May 2007, Applicant was unemployed. \n \n2 \n\n \nFollowing the fire, the Red Cross paid for three days in a hotel. Thereafter, \nApplicant\u2019s family was on its own. (Tr. 42) In order to pay for their month-to-month \napartment, Applicant obtained three loans: $512 (SOR \u00b6 1.f, initially $693), $654 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.j, initially $729), and $450 (SOR \u00b6 1.l, initially $700) to help them with living \nexpenses and to pay for their rent. (Ex. 2, 4) In November 2008, all three creditors \nagreed to accept $25 monthly payments on their debts. (Ex. J, K, L) She was able to \nmake a few payments in accord with the agreements until her husband\u2019s unemployment \nprevented further payments. (Tr. 44) Her husband was a car salesman until he became \nunemployed when the economy faltered, and he did not sell as many cars. (Tr. 32) He \nleft the state to stay with his mother and remains unemployed. The $512 debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f) was originally $693. (Tr. 45)  \n \n \nApplicant attempted to continue working following the fire, but with no place to \nlive and a young family to take care of, Applicant chose to stay home with her children. \n(Tr. 29, 31) Until February 2008, Applicant was a stay-at-home mother. (Tr. 31) At that \ntime, the children were two, four, eight, ten, and eleven.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband also obtained other loans; however, because he was the \nonly one working, his debts were paid by payroll deduction or by court order. (Tr. 48) \nTwenty per cent of his salary went to pay the loans. This coupled with the house \npayment and utility bills; they were no longer able to pay their car note. (Tr. 49) \nAttempting to the home from foreclosure, Applicant and her husband stopped making \nthe car payments. In 2006, Applicant\u2019s 2001 Toyota was repossessed. At the time of \nrepossession, Applicant owed $7,500 on the note. The car sold for $4,800. After costs, \nfees, and expenses were added on, Applicant owed $3,500 on the vehicle. (Ex. 3, N, Tr. \n26) \n \n \nAfter the fire, Applicant and her husband decided to stop renting and purchase a \nhome. They had difficulty closing on a new home. (Tr. 30) The loan had to be redone \nand Applicant had to pay additional closing costs, which caused additional financial \ndifficulties. (Tr. 30) In August 2007 Applicant and her husband owed approximately \n$61,000 on their home when it was sold by sheriff\u2019s sale for $70,000. (Ex. 3)  \n \n \nIn July 2005, Applicant and her husband purchased a 2003 GMC Envoy with \nmonthly payments of $533. (Ex. R, Tr. 29) The last payment was made in September \n2007. The vehicle was repossessed and sold leaving a balance owed of $11,731. The \ncreditor charged off the debt. Two months prior to or before the hearing, Applicant\u2019s \nhusband moved to another state to live with his mother. (Tr. 33) \n \n \nA week before the hearing, after Applicant had filed for divorce, her husband \nreturned to their home and refused to leave. (Tr. 15) While Applicant and her children \nwere out of the house, Applicant\u2019s husband destroyed property and removed property \nfrom the home. (Tr. 15) Applicant had to obtain a protective order and order for his \nremoval from the home. (Ex. A, Tr. 34) Applicant and her four children moved to a hotel. \nHer husband is father to two of the children, ages six and eight. (Tr.34) Two children, \nages 12 and 14, are Applicant\u2019s from a prior marriage. Applicant\u2019s step-son, age 15, did \n3 \n\nlive with them, but now lives with his mother (Tr. 34) Applicant receives $121 weekly \nchild support for these two children. (Tr. 35) Applicant is owed $17,000 in past due child \nsupport. (Ex. 0, Tr. 35) In May 2009, Applicant sought assistance in receiving her past \ndue child support. (Tr. 54) She was told she would be receiving $3,500 in November \n2009. (Tr. 54)  \n \n \nIn the future, her ex-husband\u2019s tax refund will be intercepted to pay past due \nchild support. (Tr. 54) When they married, Applicant\u2019s husband also owed $17,000 in \npast due child support. During the course of their marriage, his delinquent support \nobligation was paid by interception of their income tax refunds. (Tr. 36) \n  \n \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant responded to interrogatories. Her response \nincluded a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) which listed her monthly income at \napproximately $2,500, her monthly expenses at $2,375, and monthly debt payment of \n$95. (Ex. 3) Applicant\u2019s monthly net remainder (income less expenses and debt \npayment) was $5.88. Applicant\u2019s car, a 1999 Mercury, is now paid for, which saves her \n$200 per month. (Tr. 51) She does not pay child support for her husband\u2019s son and her \nday care expenses have been reduced to $90. In December 2008, these two expenses \nwere $350 and are now $90. Her salary has increased $10 per week. She has been \nunable to use this additional income to pay the SOR debts because she had a $500 \nelectrical bill. (Tr. 52) \n \n \nIn August 2009, Applicant reduced her monthly contribution to the company\u2019s \nvoluntary savings plan from four percent to two percent. (Ex. P) Each month, $25 is sent \nto her credit union account and $50 goes to savings. (Ex. Q) Applicant has had some \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 53)  \n \n \nA summary of Applicant\u2019s judgment, accounts charged off, accounts placed for \ncollection and other unpaid obligations and their current status follows: \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount Current Status \na \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. \n$ \nDebts were discharged in February \n2003. \nb \nMedical account placed for \ncollection. \n$382 \n \nUnpaid.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n5 \n\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n6 \n\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. In 2003, Applicant had to resort to bankruptcy protection. The SOR lists \napproximately $16,500 owed on 12 past due obligations. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n7 \n\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence because she had 12 delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $16,500. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). The 12 debts remain unpaid, \nwhich makes them recent and frequent. However, some of the debts, the loans taken \nout after the fire, were incurred under unusual circumstances. Additionally, Applicant=s \nfinancial problems were contributed to by her husband\u2019s actions.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required \nto be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given her \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s discussion of AG & 20(b) in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. \nBd. Oct. 29, 2009) clarifies the applicability of this mitigating condition when an \nApplicant is unable to make substantial progress on delinquent debts after \ncircumstances outside an applicant\u2019s control cause delinquent debt. The Appeal Board \nat 3 determined that administrative judge erred when he failed to explain, \n \n. . . what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the \ncircumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial \ncondition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not \u201cresponsible\u201d in \nlight of his limited circumstances.  \n \nWhat constitutes the responsible behavior depends on the facts of a given case. \nIn the circumstances at issue here, Applicant was unemployed from July 2003 through \nFebruary 2004. While unemployed and without medical insurance, Applicant underwent \nemergency surgery and remained in the hospital for three days. Three of the twelve \nSOR debts, which total approximately $9,500, were incurred. In March 2005, Applicant \nand her family lost all of their possessions in a house fire. Applicant and her husband \nobtained loans to rebuild their lives. Following the fire, Applicant was unemployed from \nSeptember 2005 through May 2007. Due to her children\u2019s young age, the traumatic \nnature the fire had on the children, and the cost of day care, it made sense for her to \nremain home with the children. Her husband lost his job and left the state. Applicant \nexperienced both separation and has filed for divorce along with the financial burden \nassociated with each. These unexpected events were beyond her control. AG & 20(b) \napplies. \n \nApplicant has acted responsibly given her limited resources in that she has \ndeveloped a repayment plan for three of the debts. There is little else Applicant can \ncurrently do to rectify her poor financial condition. Applicant\u2019s approach is \u201cresponsible\u201d \nin light of her limited circumstances. Now that her vehicle has been paid for, she will \nhave $200 more per month to address her debts. \n \n8 \n\nThe creditors of the three loans have recently agreed to accept monthly \npayments on these obligations. Applicant does not receive full mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) because this arrangement was only recently made and there is no \u201cmeaningful \ntrack record\u201d related to these three debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the loan listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.i, which is a duplicate of the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.j. \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations \nomitted).  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \nThe whole person factors against granting Applicant a clearance are significant; \nhowever, they do not warrant revocation of her security clearance. Applicant\u2019s failure to \npay or resolve her just debts in accordance with contacts she signed was not prudent or \nresponsible. She has a history of financial problems. However, the debts incurred were \nnot the type that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide \nby rules and regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The debts set forth in the \nSOR were not incurred on luxuries, but were for medical treatment, loans taken out \nfollowing the loss of their household goods in a fire, and two vehicles repossessed when \nApplicant was attempting to save her house from foreclosure.  \n \nThe rationale for granting Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial. She was \nforthright and candid in her security clearance application, her responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories, her responses to an OPM investigator, her SOR response, and at her \nhearing about her financial problems. Several problems beyond her control adversely \naffected her financial status. Her debts resulted from unemployment, (three debts were \ndue to medical problems, and she did not have medical insurance). She has arranged \nto start payment plans on three of the debts. I am confident she will keep her promise to \npay her delinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. She has demonstrated her self-discipline, responsibility \nand dedication. Her financial problems were caused by the fire, her unemployment, and \nfamily problems, rather than by her misconduct or irresponsible spending. Applicant is \nan intelligent person, and she understands she needs to maintain her financial \nresponsibility.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.n: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n10 \n\n11 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider record\nevidence favorable to Applicant; whether the Judge failed to link Applicant\u2019s financial situation to\nthe likelihood of coercion; whether the Judge erred in his application of the pertinent mitigating\nconditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is erroneous.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 16, 2009. In a sworn, written \nstatement, dated July 13, 209, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on September 4, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch on September 10, 2009. A notice of \nHearing was issued on November 10, 2009, scheduling the hearing for December 10, \n2009. Due to a family emergency, the hearing was cancelled on December 3, 2009. On \nDecember 15, 2009, it was reassigned to Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry due to \ncaseload considerations, and on January 11, 2010, it was reassigned to Administrative \nJudge Edward W.

He had \npreviously held a security clearance during 1996 \u2013 2006, while assigned to the state Air \nNational Guard (ANG).4 Following graduation from high school, for varying periods, he \nattended a local community college, a state university, and an aeronautical college, \nbefore receiving his associate degree in applied science in avionics from another \ncommunity college in 2000.5  \n \n3 Applicant Exhibit B (Employee Continuous Improvement Process, dated March 19, 2010), at 1. \n \n4 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 31. \n \n5 Id. 11-13. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nFrom 1990 until 1995, while attending classes, Applicant also held a part-time job \nwith a local company where he was eventually promoted to the position of shipping \nmanager.6 In April 1995, Applicant left his job and enlisted in the state ANG.7 His initial \nassignments were essentially part-time, working one week every month as well as a two \nweek period every year,8 but in June 1997, he was able to secure a full-time position as \nan electronic warfare technician.9 He subsequently applied for a position in the pilot \ntraining program, and in September 2001, was commissioned as a second lieutenant.10 \nAs a commissioned officer, he was no longer eligible to hold his full-time enlisted \nposition, and he was required to resign from it.11 During the period September 2001 \nuntil February 2006, Applicant chose not to seek other permanent employment because \nhe hoped to obtain a permanent position with the ANG and believed a permanent \nposition elsewhere would interfere with his eligibility.12 Applicant attempted to complete \nhis pilot training requirements, but in the post \u201c9/11\u201d environment was unable to do so.13 \nHe was denied the opportunity to continue with another class because he had already \nreached the mandatory age ceiling.14 Although he was promoted to first lieutenant, he \nwas informed that, without his bachelor\u2019s degree, he was ineligible for further ANG \npromotions, and in February 2006, was released from active duty.15 Several months \nbefore his release from the ANG, Applicant returned to his original employer, working in \ninventory control.16 Applicant was hired by his current employer in April 2007.17  \n \nApplicant was married in April 2000, and he and his wife have four sons.18 He \nalso has one stepson.19 \n \n6 Tr. at 33-34. \n \n7 Id. at 34. \n \n8 Id. at 35-36, 65. \n \n9 Id. at 36, 65. \n \n10 Id. at 37. \n \n11 Id. at 37, 65. \n \n12 Id. at 101-102. \n \n13 Id. at 37-38. \n \n14 Id. at 38. \n \n15 National Guard Bureau Report of Separation and Record of Service, dated February 10, 2006, attached to \nGovernment Exhibit 3, supra note 2; Tr. at 40. However, Applicant erroneously referred to Applicant Exhibit A \n(Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), dated August 2, 2004) as evidence of his 2006 \nrelease, but that document does not support his contention.  \n \n16 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 15. Applicant contends he did not resume a position with his \nemployer until after his discharge, but that information differs from information he provided in his e-QIP.

Prior to his commission in 2001, Applicant\u2019s salary was $24 per hour with full \nbenefits and insurance.20 From September 2001 until February 2006, his salary was \nbased only on part-time work. From his return to his initial employer until April 2007, his \nsalary was $10 per hour with no benefits or insurance.21 With his current employer, \nApplicant\u2019s salary is $30 per hour with full benefits.22 At various times between 2001 \nand 2007, all of the SOR accounts, as well as others, became delinquent because of \nApplicant\u2019s inability to keep up with his monthly payments. Some of the accounts were \nplaced for collection with a variety of collection agents, and some of the accounts were \ncharged off. During his September 2007 OPM interview, he declared an intention to \ncontact his creditors and attempt to settle his delinquent accounts.23 He repeated his \nintention during his October 2007 OPM interview,24 and again in his answer to \ninterrogatories in December 2008.25  \n \nThe SOR identified 10 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit \nreports from 2007, 2008, 2009, or 2010, totaling approximately $18,241. Some \naccounts have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection \nagents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in different credit reports, in many \ninstances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or \nunder a different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by complete account \nnumbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some instances \neliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits.  \n \nThree of the accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.), totaling $680, were with Bank \nof America. Applicant initially admitted the allegations, but now contends all three \naccounts were actually one account that was split up and sold to different debt \ncollectors, each of which added fees to their respective accounts.26 The account set \nforth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a collection account for $257, listed in Applicant\u2019s credit reports of \nApril 2009,27 and September 2009.28 An account with the same account number or in \n \n20 Id. at 41. \n \n21 Id. \n \n22 Id. at 44. \n \n23 Applicant Exhibit G (Personal Subject Interview, dated September 4, 2007), at 1-2. \n \n24 Applicant Exhibit G (Personal Subject Interview, dated October 16, 2007), at 1-2. \n \n25 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 2, at 1-2. \n \n26 Tr. at 50-51. \n \n27 Government Exhibit 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 28, 2009), at 1. \n \n28 Government Exhibit 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated September 1, 2009), at 1. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nthat amount is not listed in credit reports of July 2007,29 October 2008,30 or March \n2010.31 During his interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in September 2007, Applicant claimed that a Bank of America \n(BOA) account in the charged off amount of $2,500, was actually for an America On-\nLine (AOL) account that he had previously closed.32 In his answer to interrogatories in \nDecember 2008, he acknowledged the account, but contended the charges were in \nerror, and he would dispute it with BOA.33 The only reference to that account is found in \nthe July 2007 credit report with the note that it had been purchased by, or transferred to, \nanother unidentified lender.34 During the hearing, Applicant claimed that a BOA \nrepresentative stated that the original account was the one identified in SOR \u00b6 1.c., \ndiscussed further below.35 The September 2009 credit report lists this account as \nunpaid,36 but the account is no longer reflected on the March 2010 credit report. The \ncurrent status of this account remains unresolved. \n \nThe account set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.b. is a collection account now held by NCO \nFinancial Systems, Inc., for BOA, in the amount of $238, with a different BOA account \nnumber in Applicant\u2019s credit reports of October 2008,37 April 2009,38 September 2009,39 \nand March 2010.40 An account with that account number or in that amount is not listed \nin the July 2007 credit report. During his September 2007 interview with the OPM \ninvestigator, the account was not mentioned. In his December 2008 answer to \ninterrogatories, Applicant indicated the account was being disputed.41 Although he has \noffered testimony as to the dispute, he has offered no documentary evidence to support \nhis assertion. The most recent credit reports (September 200942 and March 2010)43 still \nlist the account as unpaid.  \n \n29 Government Exhibit 8 (Combined Experian, Trans Union, and Equifax Credit Report, dated July 12, 2007). \n \n30 Government Exhibit 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 2, 2008). \n \n31 Government Exhibit 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated March 26, 2010). \n \n32 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 23, at 1. \n \n33 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n34 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 29, at 17. \n \n35 Tr. at 50-51. \n \n36 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 28, at 1. \n \n37 Government Exhibit 7, supra note 30, at 1. \n \n38 Government Exhibit 6, supra note 27, at 1. \n \n39 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 28, at 1. \n \n40 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 31, at 1. \n \n41 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n42 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 28, at 1. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nThe account set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a collection account now held by NCO \nFinancial Systems, Inc., for BOA, in the amount of $185, with a different BOA account \nnumber in Applicant\u2019s credit reports of July 2007,44 October 2008,45 April 2009,46 \nSeptember 2009,47 and March 2010.48 During his September 2007 interview with the \nOPM investigator, Applicant stated he would contact the creditor and settle the \naccount.49 In his December 2008 answer to interrogatories, Applicant indicated the \naccount was being disputed.50 In November 2009, he submitted an inquiry to BOA \nregarding a delinquent account, in the amount of $184.73. The creditor informed \nApplicant that the status of the account was accurate.51 On November 20, 2009, \nApplicant sent the designated payment agent a personal money order in the amount of \n$184.73.52 The account number listed on the money order differed from this as well as \nall other BOA accounts purportedly held by Applicant. The March 2010 credit report still \nlists the account as unpaid.53 \n \nThe account set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.d. is a collection account now held by NCO \nFinancial Systems, Inc., for AT & T Wireless, in the amount of $992, in Applicant\u2019s credit \nreports of July 2007,54 April 2009,55 September 2009,56 and March 2010.57 It does not \nappear in his October 2008 credit report. Applicant initially admitted the allegation. \nDuring his September 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant \nacknowledged having had two cell phone accounts with AT & T, and stated he would \ncontact the creditor and settle the account.58 In his December 2008 answer to \n \n43 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 31, at 1. \n \n44 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 29, at 11. \n \n45 Government Exhibit 7, supra note 30, at 1. \n \n46 Government Exhibit 6, supra note 27, at 1. \n \n47 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 28, at 1. \n \n48 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 31, at 1. \n \n49 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 23, at 1. \n \n50 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n51 Applicant Exhibit C (Letter from Bank of America, dated November 12, 2009). \n \n52 Personal Money Order, dated November 20, 2009, attached to Applicant Exhibit C. \n \n53 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 31, at 1. \n \n54 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 29, at 6. \n \n55 Government Exhibit 6, supra note 27, at 1. \n \n56 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 28, at 1. \n \n57 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 31, at 1. \n \n58 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 23, at 1. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ninterrogatories, Applicant indicated the account was being disputed because the \nreception was poor and he had not used the phones.59 During the hearing, he denied \nhaving an AT & T Wireless account, but discussed the possibility that his wife may have \nhad one.60 He claimed he spoke to NCO Financial Systems, Inc., \u201cand they can\u2019t prove \nthat that was my AT & T Wireless.\u201d61 Furthermore, he stated he had \u201cnever had an AT & \nT wireless account with them,\u201d62 and has \u201cno idea what that debt could be from.\u201d63 \nApplicant now contends the account is in dispute and his credit report reflects that \nfact.64 The March 2010 credit report does not support his contention, and still lists the \naccount as unpaid.65 Applicant admits he has not made any payments on the account.66 \n \nThe account set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.e. is a mortgage account held by Midland \nMortgage Company, with $3,000 past due on a total balance of $127,000. As of July \n2007, he was $2,052 in arrears and seriously delinquent.67 During his September 2007 \nand October 2007 interviews with the OPM investigator, Applicant acknowledged the \ndelinquency and indicated he would obtain a second mortgage on his home by \nDecember 2007 to pay off all of his delinquencies, including the one on his first \nmortgage.68 No action was taken. In his December 2008 answer to interrogatories, \nApplicant indicated he had made arrangements to pay off the delinquency by December \n5, 2008.69 No action was taken. Finally, on December 11, 2009, Applicant and the \ncreditor\u2019s delinquency assistance center executed an FHA Partial Claim, in the amount \nof $10,818.41, including past due payments of $9,870.57 and attorney fees and costs of \n$947.84, creating a subordinate note secured by a deed of trust,70 something akin to an \ninterest-free second mortgage. Nevertheless, in his hearing brief, Applicant\u2019s attorney \nstates that Applicant \u201chas never refinanced his mortgage or taken out a home equity line \nof credit secured by the home. There are no second mortgages against the home.\u201d71 \n \n59 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n60 Tr. at 77. \n \n61 Id. at 52. \n \n62 Id. at 53. \n \n63 Id. \n \n64 Id. at 52-53. \n \n65 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 31, at 1. \n \n66 Tr. at 79. \n \n67 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 29, at 10. \n \n68 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 23, at 2; Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 24, at 2. \n \n69 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n70 Applicant Exhibit D (FHA Partial Claim documents, dated December 11, 2009). \n \n71 Hearing Brief, dated November 19, 2009, at 9. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nFollowing execution of the FHA Partial Claim, Applicant\u2019s next payment was due on \nJanuary 1, 2010. Applicant contends he is making his monthly $1,183 payments and is \ncurrent on the mortgages,72 but has offered no documentary evidence to support his \ncontention. \n \nThe account set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.f. is a collection account with a credit union on \nan unsecured personal loan73 that became delinquent and $818 was charged off.74 \nDuring his September 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant \nacknowledged having had the account but stated he had paid it off.75 That belief was \napparently not accurate, for in his December 2008 answer to interrogatories, Applicant \nindicated he had made arrangements to settle the account for $500, and that once he \nreceived confirmation from the creditor, that amount would be paid and the account \nwould be satisfied.76 No payment was made. Instead, \u201crecently,\u201d the creditor purportedly \nchose to refuse payment and, instead, decided to furnish Applicant with a Form 1099-C, \nreflecting a cancellation of debt.77 Applicant has made no payments on the account78 \nand has not submitted a Form 1099-C or any other documentation to support his \ncontention. \n \nThe account set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.g. is a collection account with another credit \nunion on a secured automobile loan79 that became delinquent and was sold or \ntransferred to a collection agency.80 The vehicle was repossessed and $5,416 was \ncharged off. During his September 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant \nacknowledged having had the account but stated he was not aware that there was an \noutstanding balance.81 That belief was apparently not accurate, for in his October 2007 \ninterview with the OPM investigator, Applicant acknowledged that he planned to pay off \nthe balance from the second mortgage he anticipated obtaining.82 In his e-QIP, \nApplicant indicated the debt would be paid in July or August 2007.83 No payment was \n \n72 Tr. at 55, 82. \n \n73 Id. at 82-83. \n \n74 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 29, at 12-14. \n \n75 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 23, at 1. \n \n76 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n77 Tr. at 55-56, 84. \n \n78 Id. at 85. \n \n79 Id. at 82-83. \n \n80 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 29, at 10, 12.  \n \n81 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 23, at 1. \n \n82 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 24, at 2. \n \n83 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 33. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nts were ever made. \n                                                          \nmade.

On December 10, 2009, Equifax responded that they had \nresearched the account and the disputed information had been verified.90 The account \nremains on his March 2010 credit report as disputed.91 At the hearing, Applicant \nclaimed that he knew nothing about the account.92 There is no evidence that any \npaymen\n \nThe account set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.i. is a collection account with CitiFinancial on an \nunsecured personal loan taken out to pay for his son\u2019s medical and dental work.93 The \ndelinquent balance was $6,970, and it was eventually charged off.94 During his \nSeptember 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant acknowledged having \nhad the account and stated he had been offered a $4,389 settlement to pay it off.95 In \nhis October 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant acknowledged that he \nplanned to pay off the balance from the second mortgage he anticipated obtaining.96 \nThat belief was apparently not accurate, for in his December 2008 answer to \n \n84 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n85 Tr. at 58, 86; Applicant Exhibit E (Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, dated December 31, 2004). \n \n86 Id. at 85. \n \n87 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n88 Id. \n \n89 Id. \n \n90 Applicant Exhibit F (Equifax Credit File Reinvestigation Report, dated December 10, 2009), at 2. \n \n91 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 31, at 2. \n \n92 Tr. at 58-59. \n \n93 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 23, at 1. \n \n94 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 29, at 8. \n \n95 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 23, at 1. \n \n96 Applicant Exhibit G, supra note 24, at 2. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ninterrogatories, Applicant indicated that while he had made arrangements to settle the \naccount, no payments had yet been made.97 Applicant subsequently disputed the \naccount, and on December 10, 2009, Equifax responded that they had researched the \naccount and the disputed information had been verified.98 During the hearing, Applicant \ncontended he had made one $1,500 payment in August 2009,99 and the creditor offered \nhim another settlement, this time for a payment of $2,500.100 He did not accept the offer \nfor he did not have sufficient funds to make the lump sum payment.101 There is no \nevidence of payments made on this account since August 2009. \n \nThe account set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.j. is a collection account with Medical Data \nSystems for an unspecified medical provider in the amount of $145.102 The account was \nsent to collection in July 2005.103 Applicant initially admitted the allegation, and during \nhis September 2007 OPM interview, indicated he would call the creditor and settle the \naccount.104 During the hearing, Applicant stated the creditor was unable to verify the \naccount because they had no record of it,105 and he did not know what the account \ncovered.106 There is no evidence that any payments were ever made. \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement indicating \nmonthly net income of $3,168.18, monthly expenses of $2,774, monthly debt payments \nof $350, and a net remainder of $44.18 available for discretionary spending.107 Among \nthe debts purportedly being paid were $1,179 for his mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.e), $200 for his \nautomobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g.), and $150 for his son\u2019s medical and dental charges (SOR \n\u00b6 1.i.).

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d118 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to \nestablish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.119  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, \n\u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d120 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d121 Thus, nothing \nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \n \n118 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances until about September 2001. He had a permanent position, was making a good \nincome, and was living within his means. However, following a childhood dream of \nbecoming a member of the ANG and a pilot, he chose to accept a part-time position in \nthe hopes of achieving his dream. His hopes were dashed. Nevertheless, still clinging to \nthe possibility of success, he intentionally ignored other non-ANG permanent job \npossibilities until April 2007. His salary plunged from $24 per hour to $10 per hour until \nhis decision to join the permanent work force once again, where he now makes over \n$30 per hour. With part-time employment came reduced income, and he tried to keep \nhis bills current but was unable to do so. Bills became delinquent and either went to \ncollection or were charged off.  \n \nApplicant repeatedly declared his intentions to contact his creditors and either \npay off the debts or work out payment arrangements. He did so in September 2007, \nOctober 2007, December 2008, July 2009, and at the hearing in March 2010. At times \nhe claimed he had already paid off several creditors. Those claims were subsequently \ndetermined to be false. Although he admitted all of his delinquent SOR debts, he chose \nto dispute several of them and claimed he had no memory of others. Of the 10 SOR \nidentified delinquencies, he submitted documentary evidence of one debt payment, \nallegedly for one of the SOR debts, one modification of a mortgage, and the \ncancellation of one debt. Despite claiming he had made payments on several of the \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nremaining debts, Applicant has offered no documentary evidence to support his claims. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG \n\u00b6 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence \nthat Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially \nmitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nAthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@122 Also, AG \u00b6 20(e) may apply where \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems commenced when he accepted a commission in \nthe ANG in September 2001, and was required to relinquish his full-time job. His \ninability to complete pilot training before reaching his mandatory age ceiling only \nexacerbated an already difficult situation. Those factors, which were initially beyond his \ncontrol, occurred long ago and are unlikely to recur. However, his actions during the \nperiod September 2001 until February 2006, when he intentionally chose not to seek \nother permanent employment, do cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. Rather than seeking full-time employment elsewhere, and attempting to \nkeep his finances current, he held out for the remote possibility of being permitted to \nrejoin the ANG, and when the delinquencies increased, he ignored them. Applicant \nfailed to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.123 Applicant\u2019s \nconduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b). \n \n122 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n123 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nApplicant did not act aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. Instead, he repeatedly declared his intentions to contact his creditors and either \npay off the debts or work out payment arrangements. At times he claimed he had \nalready paid off several creditors. Those claims were subsequently determined to be \nfalse. Although he admitted all of his delinquent SOR debts, he chose to dispute several \nof them and claimed he had no memory of others. The evidence fails to reflect any \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of any of his debts. To the contrary, of the \ndisputed debts for which Applicant has furnished documentary evidence related to the \ndisputes, the credit reporting agency has, upon reexamination, verified the validity of the \ndebts. Of the 10 SOR identified delinquencies, he submitted documentary evidence of \none debt payment, allegedly for one of the SOR debts, one modification of a mortgage, \nand the cancellation of one debt. Despite claiming he had made payments on several of \nthe remaining debts, or had another one cancelled, Applicant has offered no \ndocumentary evidence to support his claims. His revised versions of facts pertaining to \nthe debts themselves, or his actions regarding actual or promised payments, reflect \npoorly on his reliability and judgment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts were \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence.124 Applicant receives very little credit under AG \u00b6 20(d) \nbecause while he initially showed some good faith in his promised efforts to resolve his \nSOR debts, he ultimately abandoned even those efforts, with three possible exceptions. \nWith the exception of the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.e., and possibly SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.i., he \nfailed to establish any type of repayment plan, much less a reasonable one, with any of \nhis creditors, even the smallest ones when he could have done so. Instead, he delayed \nand disputed. Moreover, since 2007, he has done nothing to address the satisfaction of \nmost of his delinquent debts.125 AG \u00b6 20(d) has very limited application. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand 20(e) do not apply. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n \ndealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd.

Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. \nOct. 16, 2002)). \n \n125 The Appeal Board has previously held that \u201c[A] applicant must do more than merely show that he or she \nrelied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim\u201d he or she initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004). \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. When these \nproblems first began, Applicant was following a childhood dream of becoming a member \nof the ANG and a pilot, and he chose to accept a part-time position in the hopes of \nachieving his dream. His hopes were dashed. With reduced income from a part-time job \nhe was unable to generate enough money to pay his delinquent debts. Nevertheless, he \ntold OPM and DOHA that he was initiating efforts to contact his creditors and setting up \npayment arrangements, as well as disputing some debts that he believed were not his \nresponsibility.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nWhile the part-time employment and reduced salary were initially circumstances beyond \nhis control, Applicant continued to obtain services and goods from a wide variety of \ncreditors, but either had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he continued \nto accumulate delinquent debt and did not pay his older debts. During the period \nSeptember 2001 until February 2006, Applicant chose not to seek other permanent \nemployment because he hoped to obtain a permanent position with the ANG and \nbelieved a permanent position elsewhere would interfere with his eligibility. Applicant \nhas been gainfully employed since April 2007. Nevertheless, since that time, with some \nexceptions described above, he did not make any good-faith efforts to pay a variety of \ndelinquent debts. He established no repayment plans. Instead, he made a number of \npromises, claimed to have paid several creditors, and disputed several debts without \nproviding documentation showing a reasonable basis to do so. Now, once again, he \nintends to review his credit report and examine each delinquent debt with the creditors \nand to require justification before assuming responsibility for those debts. Once \nsatisfied, he states he will either pay the debt or work out payment arrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s promises are no longer sufficient. His failure to repay creditors or to arrange \npayment plans reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance.  \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved or at least \nunder repayment arrangements; it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns \nabout his fitness to hold a security clearance. I am mindful that while any one factor, \nconsidered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.126 The insufficient good-faith \nefforts or evidence to reflect actual payments are sufficient to raise continuing security \nconcerns. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1), AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), AG \u00b6 2(a)(4), AG \u00b6 2(a)(5), AG \n\u00b6 2(a)(6), AG \u00b6 2(a)(7), and AG \u00b6 2(a)(9).) \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:127 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c . . . established a plan to \nresolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the \nextent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nAlthough there are some positive signs, some efforts to take corrective actions, \nand maintenance of some of his payments on his daily living expenses, these steps are \nsimply insufficient to show he can \u201clive within [his] means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations.\u201d See AG \u00b6 18. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n126 See U.S. v.

Those\n1\nfavorable findings are not at issue on appeal.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 24, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided on the written record.  On December 19, 2008, after considering\nthe record, Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Specifically, Applicant argues that\nthe majority of the 36 debts listed in the SOR were either duplicates or barred by the statute of\nlimitations, and that she has outstanding debts to only 10 creditors totaling approximately $16,500.\nShe also argues that she has acquired no new debts in the last 5-6 years, except for student loans and\ntaxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service as a result of under-withholding.  Finally, Applicant\npresents new evidence as to debts she has recently arranged to pay.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not\ndemonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe Board cannot consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  Directive at \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant\nto establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had a significant number\nof outstanding debts, and was still in the process of trying to resolve her financial problems.  In light\nof the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating\nevidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He gave Applicant credit for\nduplicate debts and found in her favor as to some of the SOR factual allegations.   However, he\n1\nreasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s\n\n3\nsecurity concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record,\nthe Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice\nmade.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

This SF 86 has an attached signature page from an e-QIP version signed and dated \nOct. 31, 2007. \n \nDecember 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nher, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn August 12, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.3 A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), dated September 2, 2008, was provided to her, and \nshe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.4 On October 3, 2008, Applicant responded to the FORM, and \nsupplemented her original Response to SOR, and provided additional material. The \ncase was assigned to another administrative judge on October 21, 2008, and due to \ncaseload considerations was reassigned to me on November 3, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.b., 1.d. \u2013 1.f., \n1.i. \u2013 1.m, 1.o. \u2013 1.y., 1.aa., 1.cc., 1.ff., and 1.hh., - 1.kk.

After \na thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of \nfact.   \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old program coordinator, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since June 2007.5 She has been attending college since March \n2004. The record does not reflect how many college credit hours she has earned. She \nhas never been married and has no dependents listed in her SF-86. She did not serve \nin the military. She disclosed no police record; no use of illegal drugs in the last seven \nyears; and no alcohol-related problems, counseling or treatment in the last seven years.  \nApplicant indicated she received access to classified information at the confidential level \n \n2 On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3 Item 4. \n \n4 The DOHA transmittal letter is dated September 4, 2008. Applicant signed the receipt for the \nDOHA transmittal letter on September 11, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he \nhad 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit information. \n \n5 Item 3 (SF 86) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nin 2001. The record does not reflect whether she currently has a clearance or whether \nher access has ever been suspended or revoked. \n \nApplicant\u2019s October 2002 credit bureau report and court records disclosed she \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in October 1996, and was awarded a \ndischarge in October 1996.6 Also, her credit bureau reports reflect she had state tax \nliens filed against her in 2007, 2006, 2003, 2001, and 1995.7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial problems and \nincluded the review of her October 2002, November 2007, and June 2008 credit bureau \nreports.8 Applicant admits her past history of debt resolved by bankruptcy in 1996. \nSince then, she acquired a significant number of delinquent debts that have been \noutstanding for many years. In some of her denials, Applicant asserts no more than \nconfusion about the identity of the creditor. Her denials are generally not substantiated \nby documentary evidence. However, the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are \nsubstantiated by credit bureau reports and her admissions attached to the FORM.  \n \nAs noted by Department\u2019s Counsel\u2019s FORM, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.n. are the same \ndebt. Applicant contends that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. g. and 1.i., 1.h. and 1.j., and 1.w. and 1.z. \nalleged the same debts. She provided some documentation in Response to FORM to \nsupport her position; however, the evidence was inconclusive. The SOR alleges 36 \nseparate debts. After taking into account Applicant\u2019s claims that the above debts are \nduplicated, she still has 32 delinquent debts approximating $35,000.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness began shortly after her 1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarge and continues in varying degrees until the present. Applicant\u2019s proof of \npayments and/or attempts to contact creditors are small and recent, and therefore \ncannot be viewed as demonstrating a good faith effort to either repay her creditors or \notherwise resolve her debts. In her Response to SOR, Applicant stated she has \u201ctaken \nfull responsibility for [her] previous financial delinquencies.\u201d9 However, she failed to \npresent sufficient evidence to establish a track record of financial responsibility. \n  \n \nApplicant submitted two work-related reference letters attesting to her good \ncharacter and value as an employee. Both individuals recommend Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM failed to address her delinquent debts in a \nmeaningful way. She failed to provide information as to how she acquired the debts, \nwhy they became delinquent, what meaningful efforts she took until recently to resolve \n \n6 Items 5, 8. \n \n7 Items 5-7.  \n \n8 Id. \n \n9 Item 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nher debts, and what measures she has taken to avoid similar financial problems in the \nfuture. \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d10 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).11 \n \n10 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n11 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers to \nDOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response.  \n \nApplicant provided scant information explaining why she had to file for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy protection in 1996 or the amount of the debts that were discharged. She \nadmitted responsibility for the vast majority of her unpaid delinquent debts, which she \nacquired after her bankruptcy discharge. The Government established the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable: \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,12 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to raise the \napplicability of any of the mitigating conditions. \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt responsibly with her \nfinancial obligations before, or after receipt of the SOR. Based on her security clearance \napplication, Applicant has worked for her current employer since June 2007. In \nconsidering the number of debts alleged, she presented little evidence to show paid \ndebts, settlements, documented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, or financial \nassistance/counseling. Although Applicant did submit additional evidence in response to \nthe FORM, her efforts are viewed as doing too little too late when compared to the \nmagnitude of her indebtedness and the length of time she allowed her debts to go \nunpaid. Considering the record as a whole, I conclude the vast majority of debts \nalleged13 are still valid, delinquent debts, and that Applicant is responsible for them.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that \nshe has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that she has taken \ncontrol of her financial situation. Based on the available evidence, her financial \nproblems are recent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. She has \n \n12 See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)).

Her overall financial \nbehavior casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of employment for a Government contractor weighs in her \nfavor. She has had previous access to classified information at the confidential level. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. Aside from her delinquent debts (which is \na civil, non-criminal issue), she is a law-abiding citizen. These factors show some \nresponsibility and mitigation. Her work-related references are positive.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. She has \na significant history of delinquent debt as shown by her 1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nGiven her previous experience holding a security clearance, she was or should have \nbeen well aware of her financial responsibilities, and that her failure to be financially \nresponsible would raise security clearance concerns.  \n \nAfter her 1996 bankruptcy discharge, she showed minimum effort to resolve her \nnew acquired delinquent debts. In short, her recent efforts to gain control of her finances \nare insufficient to overcome years of financial irresponsibility. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i. \u2013 j.: \n \n For Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k. \u2013 1.m.: \n Against Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraph 1.n.: \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o. \u2013 1.y.: \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraph 1.z.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1aa. \u2013 1.kk.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA) on February 6,\n2008. On July 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant submitted her notarized answer to the SOR on August 13, 2008. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on October 7, 2008, and the hearing was held on October 28,\n2008. At the hearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through 4) were admitted in evidence without\nobjection to support the Government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and submitted exhibits\n(AE A through AE V). In the time allowed for Applicant to furnish additional\ndocumentation, she submitted AE W through AE Y, which were received in evidence\nFebruary 6, 2009\n\n Applicant encountered health problems related to her birth.\n1\n Applicant testified the date was December 2007; however, she divorced her husband in February 2007 (GE\n2\n1). Based on the intense conflict she had with him in the period leading up to the divorce, it would be highly\nunlikely for him to still be in her house in December 2007. \n2\nwithout objection. These exhibits contain a processed check, Applicant\u2019s pay stub, and\na personal financial statement dated November 10, 2008. DOHA received a copy of the\ntranscript (Tr.) of the proceedings on November 6, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling $27,865.00 under the financial\nconsiderations guideline. SOR 1.d. is the only account Applicant denied because she\nhad her own account, and her former husband added her name as secondary user. In\nview of the progress Applicant has made in satisfying the other accounts, I am confidant\nApplicant will have the credit agencies remove the SOR 1.d. account from her credit\nprofile. SOR 1.d. is resolved in her favor. \nThe period of time in which the listed SOR debts fell delinquent is between 2003\nand April 2005. Applicant blamed her financial indebtedness on her former husband and\nhis inability to maintain employment because of his unexplained difficulty in handling\nsupervision (Tr. 65). She married him in May 1996. During three months of her\npregnancy and recovery from having her baby in July 1999, he was unemployed (Tr.\n41). They could not make ends meet on her long-term disability,  amounting to 60% of\n1\nher income, so they had to live off credit cards for a while (Id.) Because of her\nhusband\u2019s employment issues, their financial problems persisted. Applicant\u2019s life\nimproved economically when her husband moved out of the house in December 2006.2\nShe has not had to pay his car insurance, and the household expenses and utilities\nhave dropped, making more funds available for other debts (Tr. 67). The only wish that\nApplicant has is for her former husband to spend more time with his son. In addition to\nchild support, the divorce decree (AE A1) requires him to pay for the cost of 50% of his\nson\u2019s extra-curricular activities. As AE M indicates, the former husband has had trouble\ncomplying with the requirement.  \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s future intentions of becoming debt free, she stated:\nSo as I will continue to show through my exhibits and things that I\npresented you, that even though I - - we\u2019ve gone through the divorce, I\u2019m\nstill making it. I pray everyday, and I work, and I pay all my debts as fast\nas I can. Before the clearance thing came up, I had already started\nmaking payments in December of 2007 to a couple of the other creditors\nthat show up on my statement of reasons. And matter of fact, one of them\nwill clear on December of this year. (Id.).\n\n3\nApplicant noticed two overdue debts on her credit report that were not listed in\nthe SOR. She testified:\nSo with all this being said, I think once we go through each one and see\nwhat we\u2019ve paid, I\u2019ve paid a lot of things off and am currently making\npayments on everything else, and including, but not limited to but including\nin the last set of exhibits I showed you, there were two items that I offered\ninto exhibits that was not on my statement of reasons, but I noticed them\non my credit report that were not satisfied, so I ensured that they were\nsatisfied before I came today (Tr.42). \nSOR 1.a. $364.00. This account fell delinquent in April 2004. In her response to\nthe SOR, Applicant promised to pay the debt. She settled the account for $291.00 on\nOctober 26, 2008 (AE A). \nSOR 1.b. $435.00. The account became delinquent in April 2005. Applicant\nagreed to settle the account in three payments; Applicant provided proof she made two\nof three scheduled payments on September 26 and October 10, and is scheduled to\nmake the final payment on October 29, 2008 (AE B). The entire settlement is $390.00. \nSOR 1.c. $390.00. The delinquency date for this account was in April 2005.\nApplicant settled the account in two payments, September 12, 2008 and September 26,\n2008 (AE C). \nSOR 1.d. $517.00. As noted in her response to the SOR, and at the hearing,\nApplicant denies this account is her responsibility. She was advised to contact the credit\nagencies but has not done so (Tr. 49; AE D).\nSOR 1.e. $497.00. Applicant settled this account for $326.00 on September 26,\n2008, and was notified by the collection firm on October 21, 2008 that there was a zero\nbalance on this account (AE E). \nSOR 1.f. $7,828.00. In February 2005, the creditor reported this account\ndelinquent. On December 17, 2007, Applicant entered in a consent order to pay\n$150.00 a month until debt is satisfied; she has made nine payments (AE F). She still\nowes about $6,280.00.\nSOR 1.g. $9,867.00. In her response to the SOR, Applicant indicated she had\nnot addressed this debt due to the efforts to identify and pay the other creditors. On\nSeptember 11, 2008, Applicant reached a settlement requiring her to pay this collection\nfirm $250.00 for the first six months, then $500.00 a month until account is paid in full.\nApplicant made the first $250.00 payment in September 2008 (AE G).\nSOR 1.h. $2,069.00. Applicant settled this account in full on June 17, 2008 (AE\nH).\n\n4\nSOR 1.i. $439.00. On September 26, 2008, Applicant settled this account for\napproximately $272.00 (AE I).\nSOR 1.j. $1,648.00. Applicant has been paying $203.00 on this debt since\nJanuary 2008, and anticipates the debt will be paid in December 2008 (AE J; Tr. 53-54).\nSOR 1.k. $3,811.00. To help her nephew get to work faster so he would not have\nto rely on other people, Applicant provided a secondary signature of responsibility and\nliability if he were to default on the car payments. After he stopped paying, the creditor\nsought payment directly from her (Tr. 56). On September 8, 2008, Applicant agreed to\npay $100.00 in September and October, band then $197.00 a month in November 2008\nuntil the debt is paid. Accruing interest has increased the debt to approximately\n$7,000.00. \nApplicant is paying two debts not listed in the SOR. AT S demonstrates Applicant\nhas been making monthly payments of $300.00 to this unlisted creditor since 2005. She\nhas made 44 payments. AE T reflects her settlement of a telecommunications debt for\n$268.00 (AE T). This debt is not listed in the SOR. E\nHaving considered the evidence as a whole, including Applicant\u2019s demeanor at\nthe hearing, I find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. Her personal financial statement (PFS)\nreflects her net income monthly is about $4047.00, and her net monthly remainder is\n$950.00, sufficient to accommodate the extra $250.00 she will have to pay beginning in\nMarch 2009 to the SOR 1.g. creditor. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant submitted six character statements. For seven weeks, Applicant\u2019s\nformer husband fell behind on after-school tuition for Applicant\u2019s son.  He promised to\npay the arrearage, but failed to do so. Applicant paid the delinquent amount in full to\navoid extra penalties for non-payment. \nOne of Applicant\u2019s supervisors praised her for consistently providing essential\nservices to the equipment specialist team since October 2005. \nThe information project manager has known Applicant since November 2007. He\nhas received e-mails from customers desiring her to be included in the new contract that\nis under negotiation. He recommends her for a position of trust. \nApplicant\u2019s friend of seven years considers Applicant very active in her\ncommunity, and keenly interested in her child\u2019s interests. \nAnother friend who has known Applicant for 15 years, and also wrote a character\nstatement (AE Q), commends her for lending a sympathetic ear when the friend\u2019s son\nwas deployed to the Middle East. The friend can verify that Applicant is an active church\nmember. Applicant\u2019s sister, who also wrote a character statement, testified they are very\n\n5\nclose, and are members of the same church. Applicant supports her sister returning to\ncollege to attain her degree. \nApplicant\u2019s job performance evaluation for the period June 2007 to June 2008\nshows that Applicant meets expectations. She currently has about $50,000.00 in her\nretirement account although she took some money out in 2005 to pay bills (Tr. 62).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n6\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial turmoil surfaced in July 1999 when she took leave from work\nto have her baby. Her husband was also unemployed during her pregnancy and\nchildbirth. Though she received disability income after the child was born because of\nbirthing complications, the disability amounted to only 60% of her salary, and was\ninadequate to keep current on the bills with her husband unemployed too. Applicant\nturned to credit cards to meet some of the expenses, and the financial difficulties\nincreased. By the time the SOR was published, Applicant owed 11 creditors more than\n$27,800.00. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay the listed debts, some more than five years old,\nfalls within the parameters of FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations).\nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) that have potential application to this\ncase. FC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment)\napplies. Though Applicant accrued no new delinquent after April 2005, there are at least\n11 debts. The record shows that Applicant\u2019s indebtedness occurred as a result of her\nhusband\u2019s failure to handle his share of the familial, financial responsibilities.\nFortunately, the circumstances have changed since the divorce decree was finalized in\nFebruary 2007. The divorce demonstrated Applicant\u2019s good judgment which has\ncontinued with Applicant\u2019s steady progress in satisfying the listed and unlisted creditors.\nHer divorce decree in February 2007 was the event that caused her financial problems\nto improve. Though her former husband has yet to pay court-ordered child support, she\nhas used his indifference to the child\u2019s needs as fortification for her resolve to regain\ncontrol over her financial responsibilities while fostering a wholesome environment for\nher child. Even though she still owes more than $10,000.00 in debt, Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness on and away from the job entitles her to substantial mitigation under FC\nMC 20.a. \nApplicant receives benefit from FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances) based on her divorce in February 2007. While the\n\n7\ndivorce probably was not really unanticipated due to the constant marital strife, the\nrecord demonstrates repeated instances of Applicant acting responsibly under\nchallenging circumstances. She has contacted every creditor in the last year to work out\na pay off or some kind of repayment plan. In each case except for SOR 1.d., Applicant\nhas agreed to a payment plan and has completed several plans involving smaller debts,\nwhile recording at least one payment in other plans involving the larger debts. Applicant\nreceives substantial mitigation under FC MC 20.a. and FC MC 20.b. \nApplicant has not been involved in financial counseling. However, over the past\nthree years, she has demonstrated exceptional discipline in managing her finances so\nshe can comply with the payment schedules. She will have to maintain this discipline for\nthe foreseeable future. FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling\nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control) applies even though she has a large amount to debt to repay.\nThe evidence under FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) provides mitigation for Applicant\nbased on her pay off or settlement of eight of 10 creditors, and enrollment in payment\nplans with the two remaining creditors. The favorable evidence Applicant has furnished\nregarding her efforts to repay her debts result in finding for Applicant under SOR 1.d.\nand the FC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s\nlife, and a careful consideration of nine variables that comprise whole person model:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation and recurrence. \u00b6 2, p.18 of\nthe Directive.\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating factors in light of all the facts\nand circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was 36 years old when her debts\nstarted to fall delinquent in 2003. AE S reflects that Applicant began repaying her\noverdue debt in 2005. AE T indicates she paid off a debt not even listed in the SOR.\nApplicant still has more than $10,000.00 to pay on the past due accounts in SOR 1.f.\nand SOR 1.g. Her sustained record of regular monthly payments to three of the other\nlarger creditors and her favorable character evidence justify complete confidence she\nwill continue to pay the remaining debt until it is eliminated. Accordingly, Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns raised under the FC guideline.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i. \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted in his answer the allegations under Guideline C in the SOR. On the record he admitted all of the allegations under Guideline F. His admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 45-year-old helicopter pilot who is employed by a federal contractor. His employment had a rotational shift of working six weeks on and then six weeks off.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn August 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nC and F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR allegations under Guideline C in writing on \nSeptember 19, 2008, but failed to respond to any of the allegations under Guideline F. \nApplicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nto me on February 10, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 24, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on March 3, 2009 by video-teleconference. \nApplicant affirmatively waived the 15-day notice requirement.1 Applicant was located at \nLuke AFB in Phoenix, Arizona and Department Counsel and I were located at the \nDOHA offices in Arlington, Virginia. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through H. The record remained open until March 10, 2009, to allow Applicant to \nsubmit additional documents. He did not provide any additional documents and the \nrecord was closed. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 13, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted in his answer the allegations under Guideline C in the SOR. \nOn the record he admitted all of the allegations under Guideline F. His admissions to \nthe allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old helicopter pilot who is employed by a federal \ncontractor. His employment had a rotational shift of working six weeks on and then six \nweeks off. He has not been able to work pending the outcome of his security clearance \ndetermination. Applicant was born in Ireland and earned the equivalent of a U.S. high \nschool diploma. He also took post-high school courses and served as an apprentice for \na period of time. He moved to the U.S. in 1987. He attended and completed flight school \nin 1989 and received his private pilot\u2019s license.2  \n \nApplicant married his first wife in 1990 and they divorced in 1992. He has a son \nfrom that marriage with whom he has had no contact. He married a second time in 1993 \nand they divorced in 1995. He has a daughter from that marriage for whom he provides \nsupport. He visits her every two to three months and spends approximately three to four \nweeks with her in the state where she and her mother reside. Applicant provides half of \nthe cost of her private school tuition of $14,500 annually and set up a savings account \nfor her that has approximately a $17,000 balance. Until he stopped working, he \ncontributed a couple hundred dollars a month to the account. He also splits other \nexpenses incurred for his daughter with his ex-wife. He estimated his annual income to \nbe approximately $76,000.3  \n \nApplicant was a permanent resident of the U.S. in 1987 when he applied for U.S. \ncitizenship. Due to logistical and administrative problems, his application was delayed. \nHe became a U.S. citizen in 2001. Applicant lived and worked in the U.S. in \n \n1 Tr. 5-6. \n \n2 Tr. 21, 49-51. \n \n3 Tr. 52-58. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \napproximately 1990 to 1993. He was employed by an American company and worked \nfor them in a foreign country from 1994 through 1997. From 1998 to 2004 he resumed \nemployment in the U.S. Many times, his employment was seasonal and he worked only \nsix or seven months of the year. During the off-seasons, he would return to Ireland. All \nof his family lives in Ireland except a sister who resides in the U.S. In 2004 he returned \nto Ireland to care for his aging parents. His mother died in December 2004 and his \nfather remains in Ireland. In 2005, while residing in Ireland he accepted employment \nwith his current employer.4  \n \nApplicant retained his Irish passport when he became a U.S. citizen. It expired in \n2005 and he renewed it. It will not expire until 2015. He was aware that having a foreign \npassport was a potential disqualifying condition and was told prior to the hearing that he \ncould surrender, destroy, or invalidate his passport to mitigate the condition. Although \nhe stated he was willing to do so, he did not. He admitted that on one occasion, in July \n2008, he traveled on his Irish passport because he was not in possession of his U.S. \npassport. Normally, he travels on his U.S. passport. Applicant permanently resides in \nIreland in his father\u2019s home and travels to the U.S. to visit his daughter. Applicant travels \nwith both his U.S. and Irish passport.5  \n \nApplicant does not own property in either the U.S. or Ireland. He does not receive \nhealth benefits in Ireland or any social services. He is not entitled to any type of work or \nold age pension from the Irish government.6 He has not voted in Ireland and is also not \nregistered to vote in the U.S. He has a checking account in Ireland with approximately \n700-800 Euros. He maintains the savings account for his daughter in Ireland. Because \nshe is a minor he is the custodial account owner. He does not pay taxes in Ireland.7  \n \n \nApplicant has a federal tax lien filed in July 2003 for tax years 1997, 1998, and \n1999, in the amount of $25,311; a federal tax lien filed in July 2004 for tax years 2000 \nand 2001 in the amount of $20,663; and a federal tax lien filed in March 2008 for tax \nyears 2002, 2003 and 2005, in the amount of $15,039. Applicant also has a state tax \nlien filed in July 2001 for tax year 1999 in the amount of $2,290.8 As of the filing of the \nSOR, he has not provided proof that he paid any of the total outstanding tax liability of \n$63,303. \n \n \nApplicant admitted he did not file his income taxes during certain years from \n1997 to 2007. He stated: \u201cI know I didn\u2019t file certain years, yes, I just put it on the long \n \n4 Tr. 22-36, 59-60. \n \n5 Tr. 36-41, 62-69. \n \n6Tr. 70-72; AE G and H.  \n \n7 Tr. 41-46, 77-78, 123. \n \n8 Tr. 93-94; GE 5, 6, 7, and 8. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nfinger, and it was past the date, and I didn\u2019t get an extensions, I just blew it off, yes.\u201d9 \nHe admitted there were consecutive years that he did not file. He did not work in 2004. \nHis testimony was convoluted, confusing and unconvincing. He could not remember \nwhat years he filed and what years he did not file. He testified that he paid taxes every \nyear, but did not have enough withholding taxes taken from his pay. He became aware \nin 2004 that he was not having enough money withheld from his pay He testified that he \nbelieved he was entitled to a foreign tax exemption because during some of the tax \nyears he was out of the country for more than 330 days. However, it appears the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed this exemption. He learned in 2000 that that \nthe IRS would not allow this exemption.10  \n \n \nAfter learning in 2004 of the tax liens filed against him, Applicant attempted to \nresolve his tax problems. He had a friend help him. He believed she spent \napproximately two to three years arguing with the IRS and made no progress. He \nadmitted he did not follow-up with this person \u201cas tightly as I should have.\u201d In 2004, he \nstated he filed all of his back tax returns but was not given credit for certain years. No \ndocumentation was provided to substantiate his statements or filings, as he did not keep \ncopies of all of his tax returns. Applicant testified that in 2007 he hired an accounting \nfirm to address his tax problems.11 Applicant provided a letter from the accountant that \nstates the following:  \n \nWe have been engaged by [Applicant] to handle, along with his attorney, \nmatters related to outstanding tax matters for the years 2005-2008. We \nhave prepared for [Applicant] Forms 1040 for 2006, 2007 and 2008, and \nan amended 1040X for 2005 to be filed for those years.12 \n \nA letter from Applicant\u2019s attorney reflects that he has been retained by Applicant and is \nhandling \u201chis tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d13 Applicant testified he \nhired his attorney in late 2007. \n \n \nApplicant provided documents from his accountant labeled \u201cTax Return Filing \nInstructions,\u201d for 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005.14 It appears these are worksheets that \nwere prepared for Applicant advising him that for tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007, he \nshould mail his tax returns that were prepared for him as soon as possible. The return \nfor 2008 advises him to mail the return by April 15, 2009. Based on the accountant\u2019s \n \n9 Tr. 113. \n \n10 Tr. 47-48, 79-83, 90-101, 112-114; GE 7 notes Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his taxes and also \naccesses a $500 penalty for filing a frivolous tax return.  \n \n11 Tr. 46-47, 83-88. \n \n12 AE F. \n \n13 AE E. \n \n14 Tr. 87-88.AE A, B, C, and D.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nletter, the tax return filed for 2005 is an amended return. It appears the other returns are \nbeing filed for the first time. Applicant did not provide copies of his tax returns for which \nthe instructional worksheets were prepared. There is no mention by either Applicant\u2019s \naccountant or attorney of the status of the returns for tax years 1997 to 2004. The \nworksheets reflect that Applicant does not owe money, which contradicts the IRS \ndocuments. Applicant stated that his past tax refunds were garnished by the IRS and \napplied to his tax debt. Although this is likely, I did not receive any documentation to \nsubstantiate his claim. The only payments made towards his back taxes appear to be \nthrough an involuntary garnishment from the IRS. He did not put any money aside to \npay his back tax debts.15  \n \nApplicant did not provide copies of any of his tax returns that he filed either on \ntime or late. He did not provide any documents from the IRS reflecting the balance on \nhis current tax lien debts. He is not proud of his actions and believed he was stupid to \ntrust his friend in 2004. At first he could not recall ever working in the state that filed a \ntax lien against him. Later he admitted that he had lived in that state and that it is the \nlikely source of the debt. He admitted he thought he could \u201cstick his head in the sand\u201d \nand that he has been slow to resolve his tax problems. No proof was provided to show \nApplicant has resolved his tax problems and is paying his back taxes. The worksheets \nprovided show Applicant is entitled to refunds. The supporting documents were not \nprovided.16 I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible regarding his actions on his \ntaxes. Applicant\u2019s balance of $63,303 owed for back taxes may be reduced due to \nrefunds being involuntarily garnished, but he failed to provide a specific accounting of \nthe amount. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n15 Tr. 99-109. \n \n16 Tr. 88-90, 99-105, 112-122. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference is as follows: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: I have specifically considered the following:  \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport; (2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nforeign country; (3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social \nwelfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country; (4) residence in a \nforeign country to meet citizenship requirements; (5) using foreign \ncitizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country; (6) \nseeking or holding political office in a foreign country; (7) voting in a \nforeign election; and \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \nApplicant retained his Irish passport after becoming a U.S. citizen and used it on \none occasion. He then renewed his Irish passport and it remains valid and in his \npossession. I find both AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) and (b) apply.  \nI have considered all six of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 and \nespecially considered: \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country;  \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;  \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor, and \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.  \n \n \nApplicant remained a dual citizen with Ireland after becoming a U.S. citizen. He \nlives in Ireland and on at least one occasion used his Irish passport for travel. He \nrenewed his Irish passport in 2005 and it remains in his possession and valid until 2015. \nApplicant has not destroyed, surrendered or invalidate his Irish passport, and seemingly \nhas no intention to do so. He has not expressed a willingness to renounce his Irish \ncitizenship. The record was held open to allow Applicant time to provide additional \nevidence. None was provided. I find none of the disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same. \n \nApplicant has federal and state tax liens debts, totaling $63,303 that remain \nunpaid. He has been aware of them for several years. He admitted he failed to file his \ntaxes during certain years, but was uncertain which years. Despite becoming aware of \nhis problems, he continued to act irresponsibly toward his tax debts by ignoring them. I \nfind all of the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered five of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control\u201d);  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant ignored his tax problems for a number of years. He did not file his taxes \nduring certain years. He has not kept copies of documents he stated his tax preparer \ncompleted for him. He only recently filed his 2006 and 2007 tax returns. He did not \nprovide any evidence as to what action he has taken on the state tax lien or on the tax \nissues from the earlier tax years. The problem remains unresolved. I find (a) does not \napply because Applicant\u2019s tax problems remain ongoing and unpaid. Applicant admitted \nhis tax problems are due to his failures to address the issues timely, failure to file some \nof his taxes timely, and failure to follow-up with the person who was assisting him. None \nof these circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control, and therefore I find (b) does \nnot apply. Applicant hired an accountant and attorney to help address his tax problems. \nHowever, his accountant only recently prepared tax returns for 2006, 2007 and an \namended return for 2005. No proof was provided that Applicant has filed the returns. It \nis unclear what the status is for the earlier tax years. Applicant also hired an attorney to \nassist him with his tax problems. I find (c) partially applies because Applicant sought \nassistance from an accountant and attorney. However, questions remain regarding the \nearlier tax years and there is insufficient evidence that his problems are under control.  \n \n \nApplicant has not made any voluntary payments to the IRS for his overdue taxes. \nTherefore, I do not find (d) applies. Applicant stated that he was not given credit for \ncertain things, but did not articulate exactly what his dispute was, nor did he provide \ndocumentation of his dispute. He may have legitimate disputes with the IRS, but without \nfurther substantiation, I find (e) does not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. He retained his dual citizenship status with Ireland, maintains an Irish passport, \n\n \n10 \n \n \nhas renewed it, and used it for travel on at least one occasion. Applicant was aware of \nthe foreign preference security concerns for months prior to his hearing and has not \nsurrendered his Irish passport. He permanently resides in Ireland. Applicant failed to file \nand pay his taxes for certain tax years. He has federal and state tax liens filed against \nhim in the amount of $63,303. Although he has been aware of his tax problems for \nmany years he has not been proactive in resolving them until 2007. He had a friend help \nhim in 2004 but the problem remained. It is unclear whether all of his tax problems are \nbeing addressed. Although his accountant completed the tax forms for certain years, the \ncurrent status of his tax liens are unclear. He did not provide sufficient documentation to \nsupport that he has resolved his financial problems.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from foreign \npreference and financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline F: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The truck was repossessed by the\ndealer; but Applicant\u2019s dispute is with the dealer, and not with the bank that provided the\nloan.  As such, I find that this debt is still outstanding.\n1.t.  The Applicant is indebted to creditor #20 in the amount of about $461, a\nfourth phone bill (TR at page 51 lines 7~12, and GX 5 at page 9).

In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\n\n6\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG & 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns.  The Applicant has a significant amount of past due indebtedness.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Under AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating\nwhere \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.@  The Applicant\u2019s past due indebtedness is directly related to a\nsignificant period of unemployment in 2002~2003.  His separation from his wife also\nexacerbated his financial difficulties.  This being said, however, the Applicant has done\n\n7\nsimply too little too late to address the vast majority of his past due debts.  Of the 26\ndebts alleged in the SOR, he has only satisfactorily addressed four debts.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  A colleague testified favorably on\nApplicant\u2019s behalf (TR at page 68 line 23 to page 71 line 4).  Furthermore, his\nInformation Security Manager does offer a letter of support (AppX D at page 1).\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his Financial Considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

When he \nstarted his new job, he was earning, with his additional benefits, about $5,000 a month. \nHe did not realize that everything could change so quickly. He is attempting to keep \nsome money in savings so the same thing does not happen again. Applicant\u2019s goal is to \nhave all of his debts paid by the end of 2009. He is also working towards earning his \nengineering degree to better his situation. He credibly testified that he has been living a \n\u201chermit\u2019s\u201d life to save money. He regularly works overtime, if it is offered. After he pays \nhis monthly expenses, he uses the remainder to pay his delinquent debts. He does not \nhave any credit cards. He pays all of his bills and car payment on time.18 He eats only \ntwo meals a day and skimps on food items to save money by eating soup, cereal and \nfruit. He copiously and regularly examines his credit report. He is learning how to \nmanage his finances because he does not want to live paycheck to paycheck. He has \ncut out unnecessary expenditures. Applicant has a written budget that he follows and a \nspread sheet reflecting the status of his debts and his payments toward them.19 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n17 Tr. 76-77; AE F. \n \n18 AE B. \n \n19 Tr. 36-44; 78-91; AE C and D. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201dThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts from 2005. He has paid some of the debts, but \nothers are still owed. I find both disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considering the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he still has several delinquent debts that \nhe has not paid. Applicant admitted he took for granted his good fortune of having a \nregular paycheck and when he lost his job his financial situation collapsed. He \ndeveloped an appreciation for scrupulously maintaining his finances. I find the \ncircumstances that put Applicant in a financial bind are unlikely to recur and do not \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Hence, I find \nmitigating condition (a) applies.  \n \n \nApplicant was paying all of his bills when he was employed. He took a well \npaying job and incurred some moving expenses to do so. Two months after he moved \nto a new location he was laid off and he was unable to find work. He incurred living \nexpenses that he could not pay and used his credit cards to survive. As a last and final \nresort, he moved back home with his parents. He could only find minimum waged jobs \nand was unable to pay outstanding bills. Once Applicant was employed in a well paying \njob, he began to tackle his outstanding bills. He reasonably concluded that it was best \nfor him to save his income and negotiate his own settlement agreements with creditors \nversus using a debt consolidation company and paying extra fees. He has paid and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsettled many of his delinquent debts. I find Applicant\u2019s unemployment was a condition \nthat was beyond his control and the direct result of his financial difficulties. I also find \nthat once he was employed he acted responsibly in addressing his debts. Therefore, I \nfind mitigating condition (b) applies.  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has received financial counseling, but \nhe provided a copy of a written budget that he is following and a spread sheet indicating \nhis repayment plan for his debts. Although he still has some debts to pay, I find there \nare clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. Applicant paid and settled some of his debts and is saving money to resolve the \nremaining debts, thereby making a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors. I find \nmitigating conditions (c) and (d) apply. \n \n \nApplicant formally disputed a debt he did not think belonged to him. He provided \ndocuments to substantiate his dispute and I found his testimony credible that the debt \ndid not belong to him. I find mitigating condition (e) applies.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the Navy for \neight years and was honorably discharged. He accepted a good paying job with \nadditional financial benefits, but was required to move to a new location, which he did. \nThe job market slowed down and he was laid off months after he moved. He was then \nconfronted with the costs of his move and debts he had been paying regularly. He had \ndifficulty finding work and could not pay his bills. He took extreme measures to save \nmoney, by living without electricity and reducing his food consumption. Despite his best \nefforts, he was forced to move back home with his parents and could only find minimum \n\n \n9 \n \n \nwage jobs. Finally, when he started the job with his present employer he was able to \nbegin addressing his delinquent debts. He has paid or settled many of them, but others \nremain unpaid until he can save enough to make a settlement offer. Applicant has a \nnew appreciation for being fiscally responsible. He is actively reducing his debts and \nanticipates being debt free by the end of 2009. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns \narising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On November 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines C and B for Applicant (Item 1). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on December 1, 2008, (Item\n4), and he included additional documents. He also requested that his case be decided\non the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n\n2\nOn January 28, 2009, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written\ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on March 8, 2009. Applicant\ndid not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on March 4, 2007.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Items 1-6).\nNo additional documents were offered by Applicant. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request in the FORM that I take\nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to the country of Israel. The request and\nthe attached documents were included as part of the FORM. The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR (Item 4) Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations under\nGuidelines C and B with explanations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein\nas findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including the\nFORM, Applicant's RSOR and the other admitted documents, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 58 years old. He was born in the Ukraine in 1950, and he immigrated\nto Israel in 1969. In 1982 he immigrated to the United States as a permanent resident,\nand in 1995 he became a United States citizen. He is divorced and he has two children,\nboth of whom reside in the United States.

It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Israel\nand the United States. In his RSOR, Applicant stated that he was not born in Israel, but\nhe became an Israeli citizen when he arrived as a political refugee from Poland. \nHe averred that as proof of his allegiance to the United States, he has submitted\nto the Israeli consul, a request to rescind his Israeli citizenship. Included with his RSOR\n\n3\nwas a form titled Renouncing Citizenship together with copies of two required forms:\nRegistration form for Israeli nationals abroad and Declaration of renunciation of Israeli\nnationality, the latter form was printed in Hebrew, but Applicant\u2019s completion was in\nEnglish.  \n1.b. Applicant served in the Israeli army from 1973 to 1982.   In his RSOR, he\nstated that \u201cservice in Israeli Army is obligatory.\u201d\n1.c. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant possesses a current Israel  passport,\nwhich will not expire until October 2013.  Applicant stated that he had requested the last\nrenewal of his Israeli passport, which was for 10 years, so that he may enter Israel\nlegally. \n1.d.  Applicant used his Israeli passport to enter Israel in years 2003, 2005, and\n2006. \nApplicant stated that when he had attempted to use his American passport to\nenter Israel, he received a warning and was told by the border police the he was in\nviolation of Israeli law. He was further informed that, as long as he was an Israeli citizen,\nhe would be arrested if he attempted to enter Israel with a U.S. Passport. \nApplicant also explained that he traveled to Israel in 2006 to attend his mother\u2019s\nfuneral and in 2005, it was upon the request of his sister, to visit his dying mother. \nHe stated that he used only his American passport for any other foreign travel. \nAfter I had drafted this decision, but before it was issued, I received a letter from\nApplicant, in which he stated that he had returned his Israeli passport to the\nGovernment of Israel, and he was informed his Israeli citizenship had been revoked. He\nalso submitted a document titled \u201cConfirmation for the waiver of Israeli citizenship.\u201d\nThese were forwarded to me by Department Counsel with no objections. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \n2.a. Applicant's son, who lives in the United States as a registered alien,  is a\ncitizen of Israel. In his RSOR, Applicant stated that his son, who is 29 years old, has\nlived continuously in the United States since he was three years of age, never served in\nthe Israeli military and is married to a United States citizen.\n2.b. Applicant's sister is a citizen and resident of Israel . Applicant testified that\nhis father and mother were divorced when he was one year of age. Since that time he\nnever lived with her, growing up instead with his father and grandmother. \n\n4\nApplicant added that he also has a daughter, who was born in the United States\nand continues to live here, and she owns a successful business and several real estate\nproperties.  \n2.c. Applicant has a niece and nephew who are citizens and residents of Israel .\nCurrent Status of Israel\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Israel. Israel is a\nparliamentary democracy whose prime minister heads the Government and exercises\nexecutive power. It has a technologically advanced economy, and the United States is\nthe largest trading partner of Israel. \nDespite the close friendship between the United States and Israel, based on\ncommon democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests, there have been\nsome conflicts between the two countries. The United States is concerned with Israeli\nmilitary sales to China, inadequate Israeli protection of United States intellectual\nproperty, and espionage-related cases. \nThe National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000 Report to Congress on Foreign\nEconomic Collection an Industrial Espionage, released in 2006,  lists Israel as on of the\nactive collectors of proprietary information. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s application and receipt of an Israeli passport, especially after he\nbecame a United States citizen, and his serving in the Israeli military, raises foreign\npreference concerns under Disqualifying Condition DC 10 (a), the exercise of the\nprivilege of foreign citizenship.\nHowever, Applicant has submitted documentation in which he is renouncing his\nIsraeli citizenship to the proper Israeli authorities, and I have now learned that his Israeli\ncitizenship has been revoked . Therefore, I find that Mitigating Condition (MC) (b), the\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship, applies to this case.\nMC (e) should be considered for Applicant since his service in the Israeli army was\nperformed long before he became a United States citizen. Finally, MC (e) could be\nargued to apply, since Applicant\u2019s Israeli citizenship is revoked, and his Israeli passport\nis invalidated. After considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline C, I conclude\nthat the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the disqualifying evidence. \n\n6\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). Those that could be applicable in this case include 7. (a) contact with\na foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Applicant\u2019s\nrelatives, including his sister, niece and nephew, who are citizens and residents of\nIsrael, make DC (a) a concern to the Government.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC):\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. \nI find that MC 8. (b) is applicable to this Applicant and strongly controlling for the\nfollowing reasons: Applicant, who is 58 years old, immigrated to the United States in\n1982 and has lived here for almost 27 years. He has been a United States citizen since\n1995. Both his son and daughter are U.S. residents, and his daughter is a United States\ncitizen. He has now renounced his Israeli citizenship, which has rendered his Israeli\npassport invalidated.  Finally, he owns no property nor does he have any financial\ninterest in Israel. I therefore, conclude Guideline B for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n7\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why MC (b) applies, I also find that the record evidence leaves me without\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated\nthe security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. -1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a.-2.d.: \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 48-year-old-technical support employee for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant served in the Air Force (AF) between 1982 and 1986 (see exs. 1 and C; R.T., at 98-99)). He was honorably discharged in 1986 (exs. 1 and C). For over 20 3 years (between May 1986 and June 2006), Applicant was employed by a defense contractor in a tech support capacity (see ex. 1). By all accounts, Applicant was a capable and conscientious performer with this employer. Applicant married W in June 1994 (ex. 1). They have two children (an adopted daughter in college and a younger daughter who resides with W) from this marriage (R.T., at 106-07). In 2000, Applicant and W moved to another state to be with W\u2019s father who had been diagnosed with cancer (R.T., at 44). W had an affair in Summer 2005 (R.T., at 44-45). In December 2005, Applicant awoke with a sexually transmitted disease and confronted W (R.T., at 46). W told him at the time that she would move on and work on their marriage (R.T., at 46). In February 2006, Applicant realized that W was continuing an affair with the same male individual, noting her pattern of being away on Fridays and Saturdays (R.T., at 46-48).

The case was assigned to me on December 23, 2008.  It was scheduled for\nhearing on February 24, 2009.  A hearing was held February 24, 2009, for the purpose\nof considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on two witness (including\nhimself) and three exhibits. The transcript (R.T.) was received on March 10, 2009.\nMarch 30, 2009\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted. \nProcedural Rulings\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him to supplement the record with faxed documentation of his divorce decree.\nFor good cause shown, Applicant was granted three days to supplement the record.\nDepartment Counsel was afforded two days to respond.  Within the time permitted,\nApplicant supplemented the record with copies of his final decree of divorce, a qualified\ndomestic relations order, and an employer\u2019s order to withhold from earnings for child\nsupport.  Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted as exhibits D through F. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline M, Applicant is alleged to have visited pornography web-sites\nduring work hours on his employer\u2019s computer from about 2001 to 2006, while\nemployed as a tech supporter.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have been fired by his employer\n(employed 1986 to 2006) for visiting pornographic web sites during work hours and (b)\ndenied any pornography on his computer when first questioned about it by his\nemployer\u2019s human resource staff in June 2006.\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been charged with assault in\nabout April 2006, for which he was assigned deferred adjudication and placed on six\nmonths probation.  \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations.  He\ndenied concealing his pornographic activities when questioned by his Human\nResources staff.  He claimed he never misled his employer\u2019s staff when asked whether\nhe had  pornographic material on his web-site or ever visited pornographic web-sites.\nHe expressed remorse for the poor judgment he exercised in viewing pornographic links\nHe claims he has not since viewed pornographic material and will not do so in the\nfuture.  He explained that his domestic assault charge was fabricated by his ex-wife\nafter he had her served with divorce papers that cited \u201cirreconcilable differences.\u201d\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old-technical support employee for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant served in the Air Force (AF) between 1982 and 1986 (see exs. 1 and\nC; R.T., at 98-99)).  He was honorably discharged in 1986 (exs. 1 and C).  For over 20\n\n3\nyears (between May 1986 and June 2006), Applicant was employed by a defense\ncontractor in a tech support capacity (see ex. 1).  By all accounts, Applicant was a\ncapable and conscientious performer with this employer.\nApplicant married W in June 1994 (ex. 1).  They have two children (an adopted\ndaughter in college and a younger daughter who resides with W) from this marriage\n(R.T., at 106-07).  In 2000, Applicant and W moved to another state to be with W\u2019s\nfather who had been diagnosed with cancer (R.T., at 44).  W had an affair in Summer\n2005 (R.T., at 44-45).  In December 2005, Applicant awoke with a sexually transmitted\ndisease and confronted W (R.T., at 46).  W told him at the time that she would move on\nand work on their marriage (R.T., at 46).\nIn February 2006, Applicant realized that W was continuing an affair with the\nsame male individual, noting her pattern of being away on Fridays and Saturdays (R.T.,\nat 46-48).  So, Applicant filed for divorce in February 2006. The petition prepared by his\ndivorce lawyer mistakenly cited irreconcilable differences (see ex. D; R.T., at 48-50).\nWhen W received a copy of this filing, she  responded amicably to Applicant (R.T., at\n51, 55).  \nApplicant\u2019s relations with W changed dramatically, though, when he realized the\nmistaken reason in the petition for seeking divorce, and instructed his lawyer to amend\nthe petition to substitute adultery as grounds for divorce (R.T., at 52-53).  When W\nreceived a copy of this amended petition (in April 2006), she was furious with Applicant\nover the adultery charge and sole custody claims based on her cited misuse of alcohol,\nprescription drugs, and marijuana (see ex. 3; R.T., at 53-56).  Notwithstanding their\nestranged relations, Applicant continued to live in the same house with W (R.T., at 57).\nIn their contested divorce hearing, Applicant informed the judge he loved his\ndaughter and did not want to move out of the house. The judge (according to Applicant)\ntold W she would have to move out of the house on weekends to accommodate\nApplicant (R.T., at 58-59).  Applicant then returned to the house to use the laundry\nfacilities.  Once Applicant was in the house, W confronted him about his marijuana\ncharges and began placing his laundry in his jeep (R.T., at 60-62).  Applicant pulled W\nout of the jeep by her arms.  W then called 911 for police assistance (R.T., at 63).\nWhile Applicant was talking to the 911 operator, W opened the jeep door and pulled his\nduffle bag out of the vehicle.  When he tried to jump out of the jeep to retrieve his duffle\nbag, he took his foot off the clutch.  This caused the jeep to lurch forward and strike her\n(R.T., at 47-48).  When the police arrived at the scene, they accepted W\u2019s story and\narrested Applicant.  \nFollowing his arrest, Applicant was charged with assault.  At the convened\nhearing on the charges in July 2007, the court first heard from the district attorney on a\nproffer for a deferred adjudication on Applicant\u2019s charges.  After hearing from the district\nattorney, the court accepted Applicant\u2019s deferred adjudication plea based on his\nadmission of domestic assault (see ex. 4; R.T., at 70-76).  The court deferred\nadjudication of the assault charge against Applicant, fined him $500.00, and ordered\n\n4\nhim to pay $400.00 to W in restitution and $300.00 in court costs (see exs 2, 3 and 4;\nR.T., at 77-85).  The court also issued a 30-day mandatory restraining order against\nApplicant\u2019s seeing his wife and daughter (see ex. 3).  This order was rescinded after the\nelapse of 30 days.  The court also rescinded Applicant\u2019s imposed probation after he\nsatisfactorily completed six months of unsupervised probation (R.T., at 82-83).  Since\ncompleting his probation, Applicant has not been involved in any other assault incidents\n(R.T., at 83).  \nIn her appearance before the judge hearing his divorce petition, W reportedly\nadvised the divorce court that Applicant had pictures of his daughter, including photos of\nher in the bathtub (see ex. 3; R.T., at 90-91).  Applicant denied the accusation and has\nno idea what is revealed in these pictures (ex. 3).  Applicant was told by the\ninvestigating officer that there were 300 or more of these pictures depicting child porn.\nApplicant subsequently was given police assurances that he was no longer a person of\ninterest in their investigation of child pornography materials stored in his home computer\n(see ex. 3).  \nApplicant received a final divorce decree in October 2006 (see exs. 3 and D).\nThe terms of the divorce decree are covered in the court-approved decree.  The decree\ncites irreconcilable differences; Applicant dropped the adultery charges contained in his\namended petition (see ex. D; R.T. at 122).  Under the terms of the decree, Applicant is\nrequired to make bi-weekly child support payments to W in the amount of $355.38 (ex.\nD; R.T., at 126-27).  Incorporated into the decree is a qualified domestic relations order\nthat assigns a portion of Applicant\u2019s accrued retirement benefits with his former\nemployer to W in recognition of the latter\u2019s alternate payee\u2019s marital property rights (see\n ex. E).  An accompanying employer\u2019s order to withhold from earnings for child support\n(see ex. F) obligates Applicant\u2019s employer to withhold $770.00 a month for current child\nsupport, but no back support.\nBy the terms of his divorce decree, Applicant is permitted to see his daughter for\ntwo weeks in the summer and every other Christmas, and possibly one week during\nSpring break (see exs. 3 and D).  W retains sole custody of his daughter under the\nterms of his divorce decree (ex. D; R.T., at 104).  Both Applicant and W are prohibited\nfrom accessing any types of pronography in the presence of their daughter (see ex. 3;\nR.T.,at 120).\nBetween 2001 and 2006 (while employed by his former employer), Applicant\naccessed pornographic links on his company\u2019s computer.  In June 2006, Applicant was\nconfronted by a staff official of his company\u2019s human resources staff about his\naccessing pornographic webs sites. This staff person informed Applicant that an\nanonymous person called the company and accused Applicant of being involved with\nchild pornography (see ex. 3; R.T., at 91-92)). This call prompted the staff person to\nretrieve his computer.  Shortly thereafter, he was called into his employer\u2019s human\nresources office and specifically asked whether he had any pornography materials on\nhis computer (ex. 3).  He was then asked whether he had visited child porn sites in the\npast.  Applicant answered in the negative to both questions.  He acknowledged, though,\n\n5\nthat he had visited adult pornography sites on his computer (R.T., at 92).  Based on this\nadmission, the human resources interviewer informed Applicant he would have to take\nhis computer to have it reviewed (see ex. 3: R.T., at 92).  Applicant was given a\nreplacement lap top computer to continue with his normal duties while his company\ncomputer was out for review.\nTwo weeks later (still in June 2006), Applicant was called again into his\ncompany\u2019s human resources office, and this time was informed that the staff had found\nlinks to computer sites on the cache of his computer, but no child porn (ex. 3, R.T., at\n92).  In this interview, Applicant provided specifics on the links he received to adult\npornography sites in e-mail messages from named coworkers, and from W (R.T., at 87).\nAlthough, he assures he never saved any graphic pictures on his computer (R.T., at\n100).  Applicant\u2019s assurances are not contradicted by any of the proofs, and are\naccepted. \nUpon providing the requested information to his company\u2019s human resources\nstaff, Applicant was asked to turn in his badge and lap top computer and was\nterminated from the company\u2019s employ (see ex. 3; R.T., at 94).  Applicant assures that\nhis wife, friends at church, and coworkers are aware of the reasons he was fired from\nhis job.  Since separating from his former employer in June 2006, Applicant has never\naccessed pornographic web sites at work, and has taken affirmative steps with his\ncoworkers to ensure he is never forwarded e-mails with pornographic web sites (R.T., at\n87-88). \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by the U.S. security agency whose programs are\ndirectly supported by Applicant\u2019s employer.  Records document his receipt of a letter of\nappreciation from this security agency (see ex. B).  His site manager for his current\nemployer lauds his expertise and contributions to their government contract (see ex. A).\nShe describes Applicant as dedicated, persistent, and extremely hard working.   His\ngirlfriend (a program manager for a large operating systems supplier) describes\nApplicant as a friendly, reliable individual (R.T., at 139-40). \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n6\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nUse of Information Technology Systems\nThe Concern: Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or\nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise\nsecurity concerns about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness,\ncalling into question the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive\nsystems, networks, and information. Information Technology Systems\ninclude all related computer hardware, software, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information.  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 39. \nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  AG \u00b6 30.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on\nspeculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\n\n7\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a meritorious defense contractor employee who knowingly visited\nadult pornography web sites transmitted from coworkers and W during work hours on\nhis employer\u2019s computer over a five-year period spanning 2001 and 2006.  Applicant\nwas confronted by staff personnel of his employer two months later and terminated from\nhis job.  Security concerns are raised as well over Applicant\u2019s 2006 domestic assault\noffense and ensuing deferred adjudication plea.\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of his employer\u2019s computer\nApplicant\u2019s computer-based transgressions raise considerable security concerns\nunder both the use of information technology systems and personal conduct guidelines.\nDC \u00b6 40(a), \u201cillegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or\ncomponent thereof,\u201d DC \u00b6 40(c), \u201cuse of any information technology system to gain\nunauthorized access to another system or to a compartmented area within the same\nsystem,\u201d and DC \u00b6 40(e), \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information\ntechnology system,\u201d all apply to Applicant\u2019s unauthorized access to adult pornographic\nweb sites on his employer\u2019s computer.  DC \u00b6 16(a) of Guideline E, \u201ca pattern of\ndishonesty,\u201d and  DC \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of information that\nincreases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing . . .,\u201d are applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation as well. \nWhile much of Applicant\u2019s conduct is covered by Guideline M and can be\nresolved under that Guideline, there are several allegations under each guideline that\nare not incorporated in the other.  For example, subparagraph 2.a that addresses\nApplicant\u2019s involuntary separation in 2006 from his employer of 20 years is not\nincorporated in the Guideline M allegations; although, the reasons for his separation are\nintegrally related to his accessing of pornographic web sites on his employer\u2019s\ncomputer.  So, too, his reluctance to inform his human resources staff of his accessing\nof pornographic web sites until subsequently confronted is not literally covered by\nGuideline M; even though, his delayed acknowledgments of accessing adult\npornographic web sites are related to his recurrent unauthorized computer access.\n\n8\nJudgment concerns are tied to Applicant\u2019s accessing of pornographic web sites\n(i.e., opened e-mails from coworkers and W) on his employer\u2019s computer over a\nconsiderable period of time (2001 to 2006), and consequential separation actions later\ntaken by his former employer.  Applicant\u2019s actions are expressly covered by Guideline\nE, and are entitled to independent cognizance under this Guideline according to the\nAppeal Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-20964, at 6 (April 10, 2008).  Where (as here)\nthere is additional probative adverse information covered by Guideline E that is not\ncovered by Guideline M, and which reflects a recurring pattern of questionable\njudgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior, independent grounds do\nexist for considering questionable judgment and trustworthiness and exploitation and\ncoercion risk allegations under Guideline M and Guideline E, respectively. \nAuthority for considering overlapping conduct under both guidelines is contained\nin the guidance provided in Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d) of the Directive\u2019s August 2006\namendments.  So, under Guideline E, core judgment and exploitation concerns covered\nby D.C. \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but\nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information,\u201d is applicable in this\ncase.\nJudgment lapses and adherence to established rules and policies governing the\nuse of employer-serviced information technology systems are core concerns in\nGuideline M and E cases.  Our appeal Board has consistently affirmed decisions\ndenying clearance eligibility based on probative showings of unauthorized access to\npornographic material on employer-serviced computers.  See ISCR Case No. 07-04193\n(App. Bd. July 3, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-13515 (App. Bd. July 19 ,2007). \nWith close to three years elapsed since Applicant stopped accessing\npornographic web sites on his employer\u2019s computer, his actions can be characterized as\naged and aberrant.  While his accessing of pornographic web sites  cannot be\nconsidered minor or  inadvertent, his actions were for the most part responsive efforts to\ne-mails received from co-workers and W.  The proofs do not include any saved\npornographic materials from these web sites or self-initiated accessing on Appellant\u2019s\npart. Under the circumstances, one of the mitigating conditions covered by MC \u00b6 41(a)\n(\u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under unusual\ncircumstances. . . ,\u201d) is available to Applicant.  Because Applicant\u2019s friends, coworkers\nand wife are aware of the reasons he was fired by his former employer, MC \u00b6 41(e),\n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d is available to Applicant as well. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has established a good relationship\nof trust with his current employer and U.S. agency customer. He has been credited with\nboth his employer\u2019s government customer and his site manager with outstanding work\non his employer\u2019s contract.  These are qualities that serve him well in fulfilling his\n\n9\nfiducial responsibilities in protecting accessed classified information.  Applicant credibly\nmakes the case, too, to his committing to avoid accessing of pornographic web sites in\nthe future.\nWith almost three years elapsed since he last accessed a pornographic web site,\na solid record of performance with is current employer, and his consistent compliance\nwith the child support terms of his final divorce decree, Applicant\u2019s collective efforts are\nenough at this time, though, to facilitate safe predictive judgments that he can avert\nrecurrence of his covered conduct.  He no longer has any of the coworker and spousal\nrelationships who contributed to his accessing actions, and shows no inclination of\nlikelihood of establishing any that could create recurrence risks. \nTaking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s recurrent\naccessing of pornographic web sites on his employer\u2019s computer, Applicant is absolved\nof security risks associated with his accessing of pornographic web sites.  Based on his\nacknowledged actions reflecting questionable judgment and trustworthiness concerns\nand his avoidance of any recurrent accessing of pornographic web sites within the  past,\nthree years, Applicant is able to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns.\nFavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the underlying conduct covered by\nsubparagraph 1.a of Guideline M and subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c of Guideline E. \nApplicant\u2019s domestic assault incident\nApplicant\u2019s single domestic assault and plea-accepted deferred adjudication and\nfine warrants initial consideration of  two disqualifying conditions of AG \u00b6 30.  DC \u00b6\n31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and DC \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\u201d\nhas application.  Applicant\u2019s lone domestic assault arrest resulted in  accepted deferred\nadjudication and a fine.  Applicant, in turn, completed a short probation period and\nsatisfied all of the court\u2019s imposed restitution and court cost conditions.   He has since\ndivorced his wife, and he has no further domestic encounters with her. \nApplicant may rely on MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d in mitigation of his domestic assault offense. This arrest/charge and\ndisposition by itself is insufficient to warrant continuing security concerns about his\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s current site manager and government customer he has interfaced\nwith in his work hold him in high esteem and value his team work and professionalism.\nHis girlfriend also considers Applicant reliable. These collective impressions of Applicant\nspeak positively to both his personal and fiducial responsibilities. \nBased on a consideration of the applicable guidelines and a whole person\nassessment, Applicant mitigates the criminal conduct specifically associated with his\n\n10\ndomestic assault offense. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances\ndeveloped in the record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by subparagraph 3.a of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors enumerated in Enclosure 2(a) of the Adjudicative Guidelines of the\nDirective.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE M: (INFORMATION SYSTEMS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFor  Applicant\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSub-para. 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSub-para. 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nFOR  APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 21, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 7), pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn May 22, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 8). On June 30, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed. On July 1, 2009, the case was assigned \nto me. On July 2, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for July 23, \n2009 (GE 6). Department Counsel offered five exhibits (Tr. 20; GE 1-5), and Applicant \noffered two exhibits (Tr. 22-23; AE A, B). Applicant did not object to my consideration of \nGE 1-5, and I admitted GE 1-5 into evidence (Tr. 20-21). Department Counsel did not \nobject to my consideration of AE A-B, and I admitted AE A-B (Tr. 23). Additionally, I \nadmitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 6-8). I held the \nrecord open after the hearing for Appellant to submit additional documentary evidence. \nOn July 30, 2009, I received the transcript.  \n \nOn August 17, 2009, Applicant submitted AE C-J to Department Counsel. On \nAugust 20, 2009, Department Counsel objected to the admission of two pages from a \ncredit report asserting that the whole credit report should be admitted or none of it (AE \nF). Aside from this objection, Department Counsel did not object to admission of AE C-\nJ. I admitted AE C-J; however, AE F will only be considered for the limited purpose of \nshowing the two debts noted in the credit report (AE F) are not a duplication of each \nother, as discussed in Applicant\u2019s cover letter (AE C). On August 20, 2009, I closed the \nrecord.    \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a government contractor (Tr. 6, 28, 31; \nGE 1). In 1989, he graduated from high school (Tr. 6). He served from 1993 to 1997 in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps (Tr. 8, 29; GE 1).

He received an honorable discharge from the Marines (Tr. 8, 29; \nAE D). He held a Secret clearance while in the Marines (Tr. 30). In 2001, he received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in engineering (Tr. 7, 29). Applicant was married from 1994 to 2004 \nand is now divorced (Tr. 33-34).

She is owed about $18,000 in back child support (Tr. 38). Her \nannual income is about $30,000 (Tr. 36).     \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nOn December 16, 2004, Applicant\u2019s divorce was final (GE 4 at 7-51). At first, he \npaid his former spouse $2,400 monthly (Tr. 19, 20). After his divorce was final, his \nmonthly child support payments were reduced to $900 (Tr. 35; AE J). He fell behind on \nhis child support payments (he was unemployed from December 2006 to April 2007 (Tr. \n25, 41; AE J).2 The state garnished his pay, and his child support payments are now \ncurrent (Tr. 25, 26, 35; AE J).  \n \nApplicant has 11 SOR debts, totaling about $36,519: (1) medical debt of $48 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) bank collection debt of $962 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); (3) bank collection debt of \n$124 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); (4) telecommunications debt of $1,972 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); (5) bank \ncollection debt of $17,264 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); (6) bank collection debt of $666 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); (7) \nmortgage debt of $9,478 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); (8) telecommunications debt of $414 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h); (9) collection debt of $405 (SOR \u00b6 1.j);3 (10) furniture store debt of $4,663 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.k); and (11) insurance collection debt of $523 (SOR \u00b6 1.l).  \n \nHe believed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($48) was a 2006 medical debt related to \ntreatment received from a urologist; however, he did not pay it (Tr. 48-51; GE 4 at 52). \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($962) and 1.c ($124) were listed as owed to the same \ncreditor. Applicant said the debt was actually about $6,627 (Tr. 51; GE 2 at 2, 4; GE 3). \nHe thought his wife opened the account in his name (Tr. 52). The account was opened \nin 2000 (Tr. 52). Applicant was seeking a copy of the contract because he wanted to \nverify his responsibility for the debt (Tr. 53). The creditor advised Applicant that they \nwere looking for the contract used to open the account (Tr. 53). Applicant is credited \nwith these two SOR debts not being established as his responsibility.   \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for the telecommunications debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d \n($1,972) (Tr. 54). He conceded that he had not done anything to resolve it (Tr. 54).  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($666) was incurred on Applicant\u2019s credit card, which was \nissued for corporate expenses (Tr. 56). The SOR \u00b6 1.f debt was incurred while Applicant \nwas traveling on behalf of his former employer (Tr. 55). His former employer alleged \nApplicant did not file an expense report and declined to pay the bill (Tr. 55). Applicant \nsaid he filed the necessary report (Tr. 56). He had a dispute with the human resource \nmanager at his former employer, which eventually led to his termination (Tr. 39-41, 56). \nApplicant said the debt was settled provided Applicant made two $250 payments (Tr. \n \n2He provided documentation from the state agency collecting child support, which showed his \nchild support payments from May 1, 2004, to August 1, 2009 (AE J).   \n \n3 DOHA omitted SOR \u00b6 1.i by mistake (Tr. 15; GE 7). \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n57-58). On May 12, 2009, he made the first $250 payment to the creditor (Tr. 57-58; AE \nG). On July 29, 2009, the creditor wrote that he owed $416.46 on this debt (AE H).  \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.j debt of $405 related to a rental car he used for corporate business \n(Tr. 61). He did not pay or otherwise resolve this debt (Tr. 61-62).  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g of $9,478 resulted from a time share contract (Tr. 58). The \ntime share was returned to the creditor and sold (Tr. 59). The debt is the remainder \nowed after the sale (Tr. 59). He has not done anything on the debt because he intended \nto resolve it using a Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Tr. 59). Applicant intends to pay his cable \ndebt of $414; however, he did not provide any evidence of payments (SOR \u00b6 1.h) (Tr. \n60). \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k of $4,663 related to the purchase of furniture (Tr. 64). \nApplicant argued the family court allocated the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k to Applicant\u2019s former \nspouse as part of his divorce (Tr. 18, 20, 84; GE 4 at 37 \u00b6 W-3). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k \nis not specifically listed in the divorce decree. His former spouse discharged her \nresponsibility for this debt using bankruptcy (Tr. 18, 20, 67-69). Applicant was left with \nresponsibility for the debt (Tr. 84). Applicant sent his 2004 divorce decree to the credit \nreporting agencies and asked for removal of several debts from his credit reports (Tr. \n87). One other debt specifically allocated to his former wife was removed from \nApplicant\u2019s credit report (Tr. 87).   \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.l debt of $523 related to vehicle insurance (Tr. 62). He questioned \nthe validity of the debt (Tr. 63). He thought he might have paid it (Tr. 64). He did not \nprovide any documentation showing how he disputed this debt.  \n \nIn June 2006, he purchased a used Chrysler for $17,000 (Tr. 45-46). His monthly \npayments were $396 (Tr. 46). In August or September 2006, he fell behind on his \npayments (Tr. 46-47). He voluntarily returned the vehicle to the creditor, leaving a debt \nof about $17,264 (Tr. 45; SOR \u00b6 1.e). The creditor wanted the entire amount paid and \ndid not want to negotiate a payment plan (Tr. 47). He believed the vehicle was resold; \nhowever, he was unaware of the amount from the resale (Tr. 48).    \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant investigated and then decided not to use a debt \ncounseling and consolidation firm to resolve his delinquent debt (Tr. 24-25, 73; GE 4 at \n53-62). At the last moment, the debt consolidation company elected to seek a higher \nmonthly payment, and the higher monthly payment was an unacceptable change for \nApplicant (Tr. 73). \n \nOn August 6, 2009, Applicant and a law firm agreed that the law firm would \nrepresent Applicant in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge action (AE A, E). At the time of \nhis hearing, Applicant had not paid the required $2,600 fee to begin the bankruptcy \nprocess (Tr. 74, 77, 83). Paragraph nine of the agreement specifies that Applicant must \npay the law firm $400 plus all fees and costs (AE E at 2). He delayed filing for \nbankruptcy because he believed he would be unable to get a clearance if he filed for \nbankruptcy (Tr. 75). Although Applicant does not specifically indicate that he paid the \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nrequired $2,600 fee in his post-hearing submission, for purposes of this decision I will \nassume that he paid the $2,600 fee (AE C, E).  \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling (Tr. 74). His personal financial \nstatement contains the following monthly pay, deduction, and expense information: \ngross salary ($6,700 plus $117 disability); deductions ($1,122), rent for a house \n($2,050), groceries ($300), clothing ($100), utilities ($500), car expenses ($320); debt \npayments ($468 on one $8,500 non-SOR debt); and net remainder (about $200) (Tr. \n32-33, 77-80; GE 4 at 4). The debt payments are to service a lien on his 2003 Dodge \ntruck (Tr. 81-82). He does not have any credit cards, and he is current on his state and \nfederal taxes (Tr. 82). He has about $150 in his savings account (Tr. 81).  \n \nApplicant provided an employee performance review for October 1, 2007, to \nSeptember 30, 2008 (AE I). He exceeds expectations in technical areas, customer \norientation, and interpersonal responsibilities (AE I). He is fully satisfactory in the other \nevaluation areas (AE I).  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \n\u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are \nof security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR response, his oral statement at his hearing, \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nand the documentation he submitted. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as \nagreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n    \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit because his \ndelinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d  \nApplicant has one debt in a payment plan (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and he paid $250 to the creditor \non May 12, 2009 (AE G). He is contesting the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. In 2008, he \ninvestigated the possibility of using a debt consolidation company; however, he decided \nnot to use their payment plan. He did not describe any other payments on his other \neight SOR debts, which total about $35,000. These eight debts are not adequately \naddressed. His retention of a bankruptcy attorney in August 2009 is not sufficient. He \nhas not filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and it is premature for me to predict that the \nbankruptcy court will discharge his delinquent debts. His substantial unresolved debt \ncontinues to \u201ccast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted from his 2004 divorce and unemployment from December 2006 to April \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n2007. Despite these issues, he does not receive full mitigating credit because he did not \nestablish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.4   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Although Applicant did not receive financial \ncounseling, it is clear from his statements that he is intelligent and has an above-\naverage understanding of budgeting and financial issues. He will receive financial \ncounseling as part of the bankruptcy process, which he began in August 2009. \nHowever, there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol\u201d because eight SOR debts totaling about $35,000 remain unresolved. He has \nalso established some, but not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d), because he showed \nsome good faith5 in the payment of his child support and his $250 payment on his SOR \n\u00b6 1.f debt.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c; however, it does not fully \napply to any other debts. Applicant contested his responsibility for the four debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.k, and 1.l. For SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, he sought a copy of the contract so he \ncould check whether he was legally required to make payments. I have credited \nApplicant with mitigating these two debts even though he did not provide documentation \ncontesting the validity of these two SOR debts.  \n \nApplicant admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($4,663) resulted from family furniture \npurchased while he was still married. He asserted the family court allocated the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.k to his former spouse as part of his divorce; however, it is not specifically \nlisted in his divorce decree. When his spouse discharged her responsibility for her debts \nusing bankruptcy (notwithstanding his argument that the divorce degree allocated the \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ndebt to her) this debt became Applicant\u2019s sole responsibility. Applicant does not have a \nvalid legal basis for disputing this debt.  \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.l debt of $523 relates to vehicle insurance. He admitted he had a \npolicy with the creditor; however, he questioned the validity of the debt. He thought he \nmight have paid it before changing insurance companies. He did not provide any \ndocumentation showing the dispute of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. In the last year, his efforts have been insufficient \nin regard to eight delinquent SOR debts, totaling about $35,000. Filing a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy under his circumstances is certainly appropriate; however, he should have \nfiled his Chapter 7 bankruptcy sooner. His personal financial statement indicates he has \nbarely enough income for his expenses and deductions, and he does not have sufficient \nincome to pay his SOR debts. He has not established his financial responsibility on \neight of his SOR debts, and he needs some time after his bankruptcy discharges his \ndebts to show he can maintain his currency on his debts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n \nThe whole person factors supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nsignificant; however, they are insufficient to warrant approval of his security clearance at \nthis time. There is no evidence of any security violation(s). He is a law-abiding citizen. \nHis current financial problems were partially caused by some factors beyond his control: \nhis 2004 divorce and his unemployment from December 2006 to April 2007. He made \none $250 payment to one SOR creditor in May 2009. Two SOR debts are not \nsufficiently established to be a security concern at this time. Although his child support \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwas garnished by the state, his child support debt is now current. His state and federal \ntaxes are current. He does not have any credit cards. His truck-lien payment is current. \nApplicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, \ndemonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He graduated from high \nschool, and he has an associate\u2019s degree. He honorably served for four years in the \nU.S. Marine Corps. His employment history, the contractor\u2019s evaluation, and \ncontributions to a defense contractor speak well for his character. He understands how \nto budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant has \ndemonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his service to the \nDepartment of Defense as a contractor and on active duty. These factors, especially his \npast government service, show substantial responsibility.  \n \nThe evidence under the whole person concept against mitigating Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial conduct is more substantial. Applicant\u2019s eight unmitigated SOR debts total \nabout $35,000, and they have been delinquent for a substantial period of time. He did \nnot meet his evidentiary burden of mitigating these eight debts. He has not paid \nanything to these eight creditors in the past year. Ultimately, he did not establish that he \nacted with sufficient effort and self-discipline to resolve his delinquent SOR debts and to \nbetter document his remedial efforts. All the factors considered together show too much \nfinancial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt raises \nunmitigated security concerns.   \n \nHaving considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk \nand vulnerability in protecting our national interests, I find Applicant has not mitigated \nthe financial considerations concerns at this time. If Applicant can avoid future \ndelinquent debt for six months after his debts are discharged by his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, he should be favorably considered for a clearance.     \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nSubparagraphs 1.g to 1.h: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j to 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMarch 30, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on December 31, 2007 (Government Exhibit 2).  On November 21, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guidelines H and E concerning the Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on December 5, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on December 17, 2008.  I received the case assignment on December 22,\n2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 8, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on February 5, 2009.  The Government offered Government\n\n2\nExhibits 1 through 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D, without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing on February 11, 2009.  The Applicant had asked\nfor the record to remain open and, on February 20, 2009, offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E,\nwhich was also received without objection.  The record closed on February 20, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 44, married with two children, and has a Bachelor of Arts\ndegree.  He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security\nclearance previously granted in connection with his employment.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges under Guideline H that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has used illegal drugs.  Under Guideline E., the Government\nfurther alleges that the Applicant\u2019s conduct set forth under Guideline H has independent\nvalidity under this Guideline.  Specifically, that his conduct shows questionable\njudgement, dishonesty and/or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that\nraises questions about the Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. \nThe Applicant used marijuana on a single occasion in October 2007.  This was\nthe Applicants first, and last, use of marijuana since 1988.  He was on an annual\ncamping trip with some childhood friends.  One of them had some marijuana and\noffered it to the group.  This was the first time such an event had happened.  When the\nmarijuana was offered to the Applicant he had some of it.\nThe Applicant freely admits that this was a very foolish decision on his part, but\nstates he has consistently been up front about it.  (Transcript at 36.)  In fact, he testified\nthat he realized he had put his security clearance in danger as soon as he took some\nmarijuana.  (Transcript at 21-22.)  The Applicant admitted this use without confrontation\nin December 2007 and March 2008.  (Government Exhibits 2 and 3.)  In addition, he\nstated, \u201cI have had to approach people that I respect and trust and let them know about\nwhat I have done.\u201d  (Transcript at 34.)  (See, \u201cMitigation,\u201d below.)\nRealizing the possible consequences of using marijuana this one time, the\nApplicant is very remorseful stating:\nI\u2019m not happy about what I\u2019ve done.  I believe that in order to be\nresponsible for it, whatever comes from this hearing, whether it be I lose\nmy clearance and all the things that go along with that, or whether it be I\u2019m\n\n3\nfound that mitigating circumstances are enough that I would be able to\nproceed with my job, at least I would have told the truth and I would have\n\u2013 well, at least I would have told the truth about it.  (Transcript at 23.)\nThe people on the camping trip with the Applicant have been his friends for over\n30 years.  His friends know the implications of what happened in 2007, are also\nremorseful for putting him in this predicament, and the Applicant is confident that the\nsituation will not occur again.  (Transcript at 25-29, 38-39, 42-45.)\nThe Applicant submitted a written statement.  That statement says:\nIn October 2007 I inappropriately used marijuana while being\ntrusted with a security clearance.  I am deeply shamed by my action and\nhave not indulged in any illegal substance since that time.  With this letter I\nformally declare my intention to never again indulge in any illegal\nsubstances.  I also declare my acceptance of automatic revocation of any\nfuture clearance I may be provided in the event that I violate this sworn\nstatement.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected person and employee.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C and D are from his current\nsupervisor, the facility security officer, and a past supervisor, respectively.  All three of\nthese people have knowledge of the incident which resulted in the issuance of the SOR.\n(Transcript at 39-40, 47.)  All three of the correspondents recommend that the Applicant\nretain his security clearance stating he is \u201cserious about security,\u201d a person to be trusted\n\u201cimplicitly\u201d and that he is \u201cdedicated.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E contains letters from people the Applicant knows outside of\nwork, connected to Scouting and to a martial arts activity that his children are involved\nwith.  They describe the Applicant as an \u201cupstanding\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy\u201d person.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n4\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2)\ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \nand especially considered the following:  \n(a) any drug abuse; and\n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \nThe Applicant used marijuana on a single occasion in October 2007. He held a\nsecurity clearance at the time he used the marijuana. I find that both of the above\ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6\n26 and especially considered the following: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. \n\n6\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  I find\nthat one is arguably applicable here under AG \u00b6 16:\n(c) Credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient\nfor an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when\nconsidered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information.\nAs stated above, the Applicant used marijuana on a single occasion in 2007 after\nbeing granted a security clearance.  The evidence is sufficient to raise this potentially\ndisqualifying condition, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from personal conduct involving questionable judgment under \u00b6 17.  I\nespecially considered the following:\n(c) The offense is so minor, so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent,\nor it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \n(d) The individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change\nthe behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\nThe evidence is clear that the Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana on a single occasion\nin October 2007 was an aberration and will not be repeated.  The Applicant\u2019s credible\ntestimonial evidence shows that he is extremely remorseful about this event, has been\ntruthful about the incident on repeated occasions with the Government and his\nemployers, and has taken steps to alleviate any possibility of recurrence.  I have\nconsidered the fact that the Applicant has not dropped his lifelong friends, but under the\nparticular circumstances of this case I find that such a drastic action is not necessary.  \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who engaged in a single act of poor judgment after\nmany years in the Defense industry.  In viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the\nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of his prior conduct.  As set forth at\nlength above, I find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6\n2(a)(6).  In addition, I find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil\n(AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug\ninvolvement and related personal conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 11, 2008. He\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nDecember 16, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 19, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing on March 5, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1-4,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf. He did not\nsubmit any exhibits at the hearing. I held the record open and Applicant timely\nMarch 27, 2009\n\n2\nsubmitted one document marked as Exhibit (AE) A which was admitted into the record\nwithout objection. The record closed on February 24, 2009. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on March 23, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 11, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p of the SOR. He provided additional information\nto support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1987. He served in the United States Air Force (USAF) from 1987 until\n1990. While in the Air Force, he completed technical courses and received a diploma in\n1988. He has worked for his current employer for almost one year. (Tr. 21). He held a\nsecurity clearance for 11 years.\nApplicant married in 1995. He and his wife have four children (Tr. 22). He has a\nchild from a previous relationship for whom he pays child support. He and his wife are in\nthe process of divorcing. This is causing him further financial difficulty.\nApplicant was steadily employed in his field until he left his position in 2001 to be\ncloser to his family. From 2001 until 2004, he held a position as an electronic technician.\nHowever, in 2004 he lost his employment due to loss of a government contract (Tr. 19).\nHe was unemployed for approximately fourteen months (Tr. 20). When he lost\nemployment in 2004, Applicant helped his wife with her embroidery business. In\nDecember 2005, he found full-time employment which lasted for two years. However,\nthe company moved out of the country. Applicant started the position with his current\nemployer in 2008 (Tr. 21).\nThe SOR alleged 16 delinquent debts that total approximately $38,000. The debt\nincludes two vehicle repossessions. He is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service\n(IRS) for a 2004 federal tax lien in the amount of $7,410. (GE. 3). His credit report\nconfirms the delinquent debts and tax lien (GE 4).\nApplicant admitted that the accounts in allegations \u00b6 1.a through 1.p are his\ndelinquent debts (GE 2). He also acknowledges that they are not paid. The financial\ndelinquencies started when he lost employment in 2004. At the same time a business\ncustomer failed to pay his wife almost $14,000. Applicant stated this has ruined his\ncredit. In 2007, he consulted a bankruptcy attorney, but he decided it was morally wrong\nto walk away from the debts (GE 1). His plan is to obtain a job in Iraq and use the\nincome to pay the delinquent debts. He tried to make payment arrangements with his\ncreditors. He explained that the creditors were very aggressive. They wanted him to sell\npersonal items, such as his wife\u2019s wedding ring to pay on his debt. He believes the\ncreditors are not willing to work with him (Tr. 16).\n\n3\nApplicant admitted that he has not filed his taxes since 2001 (Tr. 26). The\npaperwork for the filings are with his accountant and he owes his accountant $1,400. He\ndoes not have an immediate plan to address this issue.\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is between $2,900 and $3,600 a month.\nAfter his monthly expenses, he has nothing left. \nApplicant is working out of state three weeks a month to meet his current\nobligations. He works almost 100 hours a week. He sends 90% of his check to his\nestranged wife to provide for the family (Tr. 23). He sold his house to his father-in-law,\nand he and his wife received $10,000. The proceeds were split between his and his wife\n(Tr. 28).  \nApplicant applied for several positions recently that require a security clearance.\nHe attends job fairs to find a suitable position earning a greater income, but all of them\nrequire a security clearance. He wants to go overseas so that his income will be greater\nand he can begin paying all his debts. At the hearing, he was candid. He chose not to\nfile for bankruptcy years ago because he wants to pay his debts. He continues to work\nlong hours and away from home to meet his daily expenses. He is currently not working\nin his field. He is determined to provide for his family (Tr. 14). \nApplicant is diligent in seeking ways to obtain a better income. He hopes to\nobtain a degree that would enable him to get a better job (Tr. 29). He is searching for\nany employer who would pay for his education. He is also exploring other options, such\nas an apprenticeship. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts. He\nadmits that he did not meet his financial obligations from 2004 until the present. He is\n\n5\nindebted to the IRS. His credit reports confirm that he has recent debts as well. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose when he lost his job in 2004. He has unresolved debt of\napproximately $38,000, and he is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $7,410. He has\nnot made any payments on these debts. This potentially mitigating condition does not\napply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant lost\nemployment and his wife had a client who did not pay a substantial amount of money.\nHe has been employed for a number of years, admittedly, at a lower pay. He also\nexplained that he pays child support and that he and his current wife are in the process\nof getting a divorce. Applicant has worked hard, but has not acted as responsibly as he\ncould have in identifying and resolving these debts. He admits making poor financial\ndecisions. I find this mitigating condition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. He did\ncontact a bankruptcy attorney. He has no plan at the present time to pay his delinquent\ndebts. He is trying to obtain employment overseas to begin a payment plan. His\npromises to pay in the future do not constitute evidence of financial reform or resolution\nof debts. I conclude these mitigating conditions do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\n\n6\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant intends to pay his debts\nand his tax lien. Although, he admitted that he has no immediate plan to pay his\ndelinquent debts due to insufficient income. His goal is to find employment in Iraq and\nuse the income to pay his delinquent bills.  He had a clearance for eleven years. He\nsuffered from unemployment and is working hard to support his family. He was candid\nand straightforward at the hearing. He does not want to file for bankruptcy. The record\ndoes not show any good-faith efforts to resolve any of his debts. His recent efforts to\nobtain employment overseas to enable him to pay his debts are not sufficient for him to\nmeet the burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn November 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 19, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 7, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. His admissions to the \nallegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old information technology consultant who has worked for \na federal contractor since 2006. He has earned a bachelor of science degree, a \nmaster\u2019s degree and is a PhD candidate. Applicant was born in the U.S. His mother was \nborn in the U.S. His father was born in Iran, immigrated to the U.S. in the 1960s, and \nlater became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In accordance with Iranian law, Applicant is \nconsidered an Iranian citizen because his father was born there. Applicant\u2019s father has \nrelatives that live in Iran whom he visits.1 \n \n \nIn 2000, Applicant traveled to Turkey with his family to meet a woman from Iran \nwho was a relative of an Iranian family who lived in the U.S. They met and the families \narranged for them to be married while in Turkey. They were married in Turkey a couple \nof weeks after they met. Applicant\u2019s wife returned to Iran and he returned to the U.S. In \n2001, Applicant obtained an Iranian passport so he could travel to Iran and make \narrangements for his wife to accompany him to the U.S. They decided the families were \nnot compatible and in September 2003 they were divorced in the U.S.2  \n \nApplicant used his Iranian passport to travel to Iran in 2001, 2002 and 2004. He \nstayed with his cousin in 2001. He did not visit his wife when he was in Iran as the \nmarriage was irreconcilable. While in Iran, Applicant visited his father\u2019s two sisters, and \nhis father\u2019s brother and cousins. During his trip in 2002 he met his second wife through \ntheir families. Sometime later he proposed marriage to his second wife and applied for a \nfianc\u00e9e visa for her to come to the U.S. In 2004, she completed the necessary \nrequirements and obtained a temporary resident card for entry to the U.S. She returned \nwith Applicant to the U.S. in June 2004 and they were married in July 2004. She was \nissued a permanent resident card and completed the requirements to apply to be a \nnaturalized citizen. Applicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2009.3 \nShe retained her Iranian passport and has not obtained a U.S. passport, but intends to. \nApplicant and his wife have a nine-month-old son.

She is a college graduate and works as a computer programmer.4  \n \nApplicant stated in order for him to travel to Iran he was required to obtain an \nIranian passport. He stated this requirement was dictated by Iranian law and due to his \nparents\u2019 Iranian citizenship. Applicant\u2019s mother was born in the U.S. and has no Iranian \nheritage. She applied for and was granted an Iranian passport in 2000. She was entitled \nto obtain the passport due to her marriage to an Iranian citizen. She traveled to Iran \nusing her Iranian passport in 2001 and 2004. Her passport has expired. Applicant stated \nhe only uses his Iranian passport for entry and exit from Iran.5  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Iranian passport expired on December 6, 2006. In the SOR \u00b6 1.c \ndated November 28, 2008, it was alleged \u201cAs of August 28, 2008, you intend to renew \nyour Iranian passport.\u201d Applicant\u2019s answer dated December 19, 2008, to the SOR was: \n\u201cI admit that as of August 28, 2008, I intend to renew my Iranian passport. Clarification: \nThis is necessary to safely enter and exit Iran per the clarification provided [i]n \nsubparagraph [1]a above.\u201d6  \n \n \nApplicant failed to include in his answer to the SOR that he had already renewed \nhis Iranian passport in October 2008 and was days from using it to travel with his wife \nand son to Iran for three weeks over the December holidays to visit her family. His wife \nand son stayed for six weeks. He had also obtained an Iranian passport for his son. He \nstated he renewed his passport after his son was born so his wife and son could visit \nIran. He explained he did not think it was relevant to explain in his answer to the SOR \nthat he had already renewed his Iranian passport and was due to travel to Iran at the \ntime. He stated he was asked to admit or deny the SOR allegations and that is what he \nwas trying to do. Applicant also provided clarification to his answers, but did not include \nthat he had already renewed his passport.7  \n \n \nApplicant did not list on his security clearance application (SCA) that he had \nvisited Iran in 2001 and 2002. He did list his 2004 trip. He stated it was not his intention \nto omit this information. He stated he fully disclosed this information during his interview \nand interrogatories.8 \n \n \nOn April 29, 2009, Applicant surrendered to the Embassy of Pakistan, Interests \nSection of the Islamic Republic of Iran, his Iranian passport that was to expire on \n \n4 Tr. 29-30, 37-40, 56-70, 81-95. \n \n5 Tr. 29, 57-59, 95-97. \n \n6 Answer to SOR dated December 19, 2008. \n \n7 Tr. 81-94, 118-122. \n \n8 Tr. 74-75. I have not considered this omitted information for disqualifying purposes, but have \nconsidered it when analyzing the whole person. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nSeptember 10, 2013, and requested it be canceled or destroyed.9 On the form required \nto be signed for relinquishing the passport he indicated the request was due to his work. \nApplicant stated he was waiting until his wife was a U.S. citizen before surrendering the \npassport, which he did.10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family lives in Iran. She visited them each year from 2005 to \n2008. Her family\u2019s visa request to visit her in the U.S. was denied. They are hoping her \nfamily can obtain a different visa so they can visit. Both he and his wife intend to \nsponsor her parents\u2019 immigration to the U.S. and support them when they come to live \nin the U.S. All of his wife\u2019s family lives in Iran. Applicant stated when interviewed that he \nwas not willing to renounce his Iranian citizenship because of the difficulty his mother \nhad obtaining her Iranian citizenship.11  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, at the time of hearing, was in Iran and planned to stay for \napproximately six weeks. He has traveled one time to Iran since 2004. He visited his \nfamily while there.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iran. His wife also has two \nsisters that are citizens of Iran. One sister is 26 years old and married to an Iranian \ncitizen. They live in Malaysia. The younger sister is 17 years old and is a resident of \nIran. His wife\u2019s father is retired from construction and her mother owns a seamstress \nschool. His father-in-law receives a pension from the construction company.12  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife contacts her family in Iran two to three times a week by \ntelephone. Their conversations are family oriented. Applicant converses with them \nminimally because he does not have a strong command of their language and they do \nnot have a strong command of the English language.13  \n \n \nApplicant has not voted in an Iranian election. He was unsure if his wife had \nvoted in the past. He stated his wife may inherit family property. He does not own any \nproperty in Iran and all of his assets are in the U.S.14  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father travels to Iran and at the time of the hearing was visiting Iran \nfor approximately six weeks. He visits his brothers and sister who reside in Iran. \nApplicant\u2019s sister is also a dual citizen of Iran and the U.S. and is a resident of Saudi \nArabia. She is married to a Sudanese man whom she met while residing in the U.S. \n \n9 AE A and B. \n \n10 Tr. 27-28, 84-88. \n \n11 Tr. 70-72, 75-77, 99-105; GE 3 at page 1. \n \n12 Tr. 60-63, 114-117. \n \n13 Tr. 30, 109-111. \n \n14 Tr. 34-37, 123, 126. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nThey were married in 2001 and have a daughter. Applicant does not know what his \nsister\u2019s husband does for employment. He has never met his brother-in-law, but has \nmet his niece when his sister returns to the U.S. They visit periodically. Applicant talks \nwith his sister about once a month.15 \n \nIran16 \n \n \nIran is a theocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the \nkey power structures. Iran engages in clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons \nand other weapons of mass destruction (WMD), sponsors international terrorism, \nintervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq, undermines the Middle East peace process, and \nviolates the human rights of the Iranian people. The United States and its allies are \nattempting to block Iran\u2019s goals of obtaining nuclear weapons and other WMD and to \ncounter Iran\u2019s efforts to destabilize Iraq and other Middle East countries.  \n \n \nIran is one of the most active state sponsors of terrorism. The United States is \nconcerned about the possibility that terrorists could eventually obtain WMD from Iran. \nIran supports terrorists who attack Israel and Shiite militias who encourage, facilitate \nand engage in sectarian violence in Iraq.  \n \n \nIranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, should carefully consider the risks of \ntravel in Iran because they are still considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities. \nIran does not recognize dual citizenship. The Iranian government has harassed and \ndetailed dual citizens of the United States and Iran.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n15 Tr. 106-108, 111-117, 123-124. \n \n16 HE I to XVII. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 expresses the security concern involving foreign preference: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following:  \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport, and \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen.  \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth. He applied for Iranian citizenship and was \ngranted it because he is the child of an Iranian citizen. Applicant\u2019s father is a dual citizen \nof Iran and the U.S. Applicant applied for, used, and renewed an Iranian passport so he \ncould travel to Iran. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 11:  \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; and  \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \nApplicant was born in the U.S. and is a U.S. citizen. His father was born in Iran. \nIran considers Applicant a citizen of its country due to his father\u2019s citizenship. However, \nApplicant exercised dual citizenship by applying for and using an Iranian passport to \ntravel to and from Iran, thereby exercising rights of an Iranian citizen. I find mitigating \nconditions (a) and (c) do not apply. \n \nApplicant was not willing to renounce his Iranian citizenship, so mitigating \ncondition (b) does not apply. Applicant has surrendered his Iranian passport to \nappropriate authorities. Hence, mitigating condition (d) applies.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n(c) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened  risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and son are dual citizens of Iran and travel to Iran regularly for \nextended periods of time to visit her relatives who are citizens and residents there. \nApplicant\u2019s wife communicates two to three times a week with her family there. Although \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a new citizen of the U.S. she retains strong ties to Iran. Obviously \nApplicant shares living quarters with his wife and he facilitates and supports her travel \nand his son to Iran to visit her family. He also traveled to Iran to visit family. His first \nmarriage was arranged for him with an Iranian woman. While visiting Iran he met his \nsecond wife. Applicant does not know what his brother-in-law does for a living.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of Iran as is his \n\n \n9 \n \n \nson and they travel to Iran to visit her family. Applicant is hoping her family will get visas \nto visit them in the U.S. However, his wife still travels there. This close relationship with \nhis wife and her relationship with her family create a heightened risk of foreign pressure \nor attempted exploitation because Iran and the United States\u2019 relationship is not friendly. \nApplicant\u2019s connections with his wife and her relationship with her Iranian family also \ncreates a conflict of interests because his relationship with her and her family are \nsufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to help his wife\u2019s Iranian \nfamily. Therefore, I find disqualifying conditions (a), (b) and (c) apply. It appears \nApplicant\u2019s wife may be entitled to an inheritance in the future; at present she does not \nhave financial interests or business interests in Iran and disqualifying condition (e) does \nnot apply. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s sister, who is a dual citizen of Iran, has \nvisited Iran or maintains any type of contact with relatives there. I find no disqualifying \nconditions apply to her.  \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and especially considered the following: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant has traveled to Iran to visit his family and in-laws. His wife maintains \nclose communication with her family in Iran, calling them several times a week and \nvisiting them annually. Applicant has not met his burden of establishing that it is unlikely \nhe will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his wife and \nher family living in Iran and the interests of the U.S. Their frequent contacts with family \nin Iran could potentially force him to choose between the two.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the foreign government, or the country is \n\n \n10 \n \n \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. Iran\u2019s hostility to the U.S. \nplaces a very heavy burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his wife and \nher family in Iran do not pose a security risk, and he is not in a position to be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the U.S. and his family members. With its adversarial stance \nand its negative human rights record, it is conceivable that Iran would target any citizen \nin an attempt to gather information from the U.S. I find mitigating condition (a) does not \napply. \n \nApplicant is a U.S. born citizen, who has ties to Iran. He actively pursued \nobtaining an Iranian passport so he could travel to Iran. He participated in an arranged \nmarriage with an Iranian woman. He again traveled to Iran to visit his side of the family \nand met his second wife in Iran. He and his wife returned to Iran to visit her relatives. \nHis son is a dual citizen of Iran. Although he recently surrendered his Iranian passport it \ndoes not negate his past contact and actions regarding Iran. I find under the \ncircumstances there could be a conflict of interest and mitigating condition (b) does not \napply.  \n \nSecurity concerns are reduced where contact and correspondence with foreign \ncitizens are casual and infrequent because the risk of foreign exploitation or pressure is \nless. Applicant\u2019s wife maintains regular contact with her family in Iran. Applicant also \nmaintains regular contact with them. They both, along with their son, were in Iran in \nDecember 2008 visiting her relatives. They both hope to sponsor her family to the U.S. \nHe speaks with his sister, a dual citizen of Iran, monthly. These contacts are not casual \nand infrequent. I find mitigating condition (c) does not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man who \nrecently surrendered his Iranian passport after his wife became a U.S. citizen. She and \ntheir son are dual citizens of Iran and the U.S. Applicant has family ties through his wife \nto her family in Iran and through his father. His wife continues to be an active dual \ncitizen. Her family has been denied a visa to the U.S. so she visits them in Iran. \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s contact with family in Iran create a heightened security risk. Iran \nis a country of concern due to their animosity toward the U.S., their approval of state \nsponsored terrorism and their human rights record. Applicant has been an active dual \ncitizen of Iran and recently surrendered his passport, thereby mitigating the foreign \npreference concerns. However, Applicant has not met his heavy burden of persuasion \nregarding the foreign influence security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Preference, but failed to mitigate Foreign Influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs  1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline B: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c. \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.
